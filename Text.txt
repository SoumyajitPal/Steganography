1
00:00:01,521 --> 00:00:03,420
<i>Previously on</i> Elementary...

2
00:00:03,422 --> 00:00:04,761
If you're looking for Sherlock,
he's downstairs.

3
00:00:04,785 --> 00:00:05,841
Okay.

4
00:00:05,842 --> 00:00:07,541
<i>His name is Harlan Emple.</i>

5
00:00:07,543 --> 00:00:09,176
<i>He is the Rachel P. Hanson</i>
<i>Professor</i>

6
00:00:09,178 --> 00:00:11,301
for Applied Mathematics
at Columbia University.

7
00:00:11,301 --> 00:00:14,502
What I don't get is
why he isn't wearing a shirt.

8
00:00:14,504 --> 00:00:17,372
He doesn't like anything to come
between him and the numbers.

9
00:00:17,374 --> 00:00:18,415
What is it?

10
00:00:18,438 --> 00:00:20,274
The answers to your questions
about Kitty.

11
00:00:20,276 --> 00:00:22,710
The truth is she was a
victim of a horrific crime.

12
00:00:22,712 --> 00:00:24,646
<i>After you left last night,</i>

13
00:00:24,648 --> 00:00:26,848
Sherlock gave me an envelope.

14
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,249
Sherlock keeps saying

15
00:00:28,251 --> 00:00:30,385
that I need to get
a better sense of you,

16
00:00:30,387 --> 00:00:33,021
and maybe that will give you
a better sense of me.

17
00:00:42,065 --> 00:00:43,065
It's open.

18
00:00:47,637 --> 00:00:49,003
It's nothing.

19
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:50,872
It's Sherlock and
one of his experts.

20
00:00:50,874 --> 00:00:52,006
Which one?

21
00:00:52,008 --> 00:00:53,241
Phillip something.

22
00:00:53,243 --> 00:00:54,575
Must be new.

23
00:00:54,577 --> 00:00:57,445
He's a knife-thrower.

24
00:00:57,447 --> 00:00:58,913
Why does Sherlock have
a knife-thrower?

25
00:00:58,915 --> 00:01:00,748
He got bored the other day,

26
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,185
started looking into this, uh,
circus accident from the '30s.

27
00:01:04,187 --> 00:01:07,922
The Great Galardo perforated one
of his assistants during an act,

28
00:01:07,924 --> 00:01:09,924
except Sherlock thinks
the blade was thrown

29
00:01:09,926 --> 00:01:11,492
by somebody in the stands,
not Galardo.

30
00:01:11,494 --> 00:01:15,096
Phillip, as far as I
can tell, disagrees.

31
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:18,900
It can't be done, okay?

32
00:01:18,902 --> 00:01:19,934
It was done.

33
00:01:19,936 --> 00:01:21,335
You're wrong.

34
00:01:21,337 --> 00:01:23,538
Nobody can chuck
a knife that far.

35
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,239
What's this?

36
00:01:25,241 --> 00:01:26,207
You're...

37
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:27,209
Not here.

38
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,509
I'm not here.

39
00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:29,711
Remember that, okay?

40
00:01:29,713 --> 00:01:31,279
Oh, yes. Heaven
forfend your work

41
00:01:31,281 --> 00:01:33,247
with me should endanger
your precious day job.

42
00:01:33,249 --> 00:01:35,116
You throw knives?

43
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,252
You know, it was supposed
to be just you here.

44
00:01:38,254 --> 00:01:41,355
Phillip is arguably the greatest
knife-thrower in the world.

45
00:01:41,357 --> 00:01:42,790
Has been for decades.

46
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:43,925
Only, there's little money

47
00:01:43,927 --> 00:01:45,193
to be made
in the impalement arts.

48
00:01:45,195 --> 00:01:46,494
So, as a youth, he turned

49
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,563
to what you Americans
term “football”"

50
00:01:48,565 --> 00:01:50,131
Is this a joke?

51
00:01:53,837 --> 00:01:55,002
Phillip, head
and heart.

52
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:56,904
Come on.
Head and heart.

53
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:06,814
Can I go?

54
00:02:06,816 --> 00:02:09,484
Yeah.

55
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,489
15 years he spent throwing
that misshapen ball around.

56
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:16,057
15 years.

57
00:02:16,059 --> 00:02:18,259
When I think of the acclaim
he could have brought

58
00:02:18,261 --> 00:02:20,828
to competitive blade slinging.

59
00:02:27,237 --> 00:02:29,036
You're following me,
Watson.

60
00:02:29,038 --> 00:02:30,338
I don't like it.

61
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,740
I want you to help
me with something.

62
00:02:32,742 --> 00:02:33,908
This is Chad Keswick.

63
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,976
He buys distressed
buildings,

64
00:02:34,978 --> 00:02:36,210
paints, spackles,

65
00:02:36,212 --> 00:02:37,645
and then flips them
for quick money.

66
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:39,180
Who'd he kill?
No one.

67
00:02:39,182 --> 00:02:41,315
I was hired by one of
his rivals to find out

68
00:02:41,317 --> 00:02:43,017
why he's been circling
this old office building

69
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:44,218
in Jamaica, Queens.

70
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,586
She wants to know
why he thinks

71
00:02:45,588 --> 00:02:47,355
the building is
a good investment.

72
00:02:47,357 --> 00:02:49,590
Is there a crime in there,
something worth investigating?

73
00:02:49,592 --> 00:02:50,925
Well, I've been
shadowing Keswick,

74
00:02:50,927 --> 00:02:52,593
but yesterday I think
he noticed me.

75
00:02:52,595 --> 00:02:54,595
I want to switch
up the tail.

76
00:02:54,597 --> 00:02:57,231
You followed me for over
a week before I noticed you.

77
00:02:57,233 --> 00:02:59,033
Help me out, and I'll
cut you in on my fee.

78
00:02:59,035 --> 00:03:02,003
I don't work for you,
I work for Sherlock.

79
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:03,437
I worked for him, too.

80
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,773
And, in my experience,
he was always supportive

81
00:03:05,775 --> 00:03:07,942
of taking on work
outside the partnership.

82
00:03:07,944 --> 00:03:10,912
Sorry, it's not my cup of tea.

83
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:33,034
Hello, Portal Ten.

84
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,247
I'm here, Belphegor.

85
00:03:46,249 --> 00:03:49,784
So where is the next clue?

Yeah, you called it

91
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,491
Belphegor's Prime.

92
00:04:50,761 --> 00:04:53,262
Think Cicada 3301
or Octorine's Challenge.

93
00:04:54,365 --> 00:04:55,631
They're math games.

94

Math-- maybe you've heard of it.

95
00:04:56,867 --> 00:04:58,333
I've got some math for you.

96
00:04:58,335 --> 00:05:00,335
One dead guy
plus one live guy

97
00:05:00,337 --> 00:05:02,104
found in the same
deserted factory.

98
00:05:02,106 --> 00:05:06,108
I was not “found” there;
I am the one who called 911.

99
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,310
I was waiting there
for the police.

100
00:05:08,312 --> 00:05:09,745
Mr. Emple,

101
00:05:09,747 --> 00:05:11,613
we're just trying
to do our jobs, all right?

102
00:05:11,615 --> 00:05:13,048
First officers
on the scene described you

103
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,516
as “extremely agitated.”

104
00:05:14,518 --> 00:05:15,984
Well, of course
I was agitated.

105
00:05:15,986 --> 00:05:18,754
I had just found
a dead guy in mothballs!

106
00:05:18,756 --> 00:05:21,790
And did I mention that I have
not slept in almost two days?

107
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:23,358
Because of the math game.

108
00:05:24,762 --> 00:05:26,195
Can I borrow those?

109
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:31,100
This...

110
00:05:31,102 --> 00:05:33,302
is Belphegor's Prime, okay?

111
00:05:33,304 --> 00:05:35,304
It's a numeric palindrome.

112
00:05:35,306 --> 00:05:40,776
It's 666 bookended by 13 zeroes
and then bracketed with ones.

113
00:05:40,778 --> 00:05:43,846
Named for the demon Belphegor
who was a prince of hell.

114
00:05:43,848 --> 00:05:46,448
The first clue for the hunt
started making the rounds

115
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,883
a few months ago.

116
00:05:47,885 --> 00:05:49,651
It was a JPEG with two numbers
hidden in it.

117
00:05:49,653 --> 00:05:51,453
You divide those numbers
by Belphegor's Prime,

118
00:05:51,455 --> 00:05:54,890
and you get the GPS coordinates
for a restroom at the Bronx Zoo.

119
00:05:54,892 --> 00:05:56,959
You go to the restroom,
you find a phone number.

120
00:05:56,961 --> 00:05:58,927
You send a text to the number,
you get the next clue.

121
00:05:58,929 --> 00:05:59,962
Which is another math problem.

122
00:05:59,964 --> 00:06:00,929
Exactly.

123
00:06:00,931 --> 00:06:02,397
Only, this one is harder.

124
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,099
And that's how it works.

125
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:05,934
You know, but for
each one that you solve,

126
00:06:05,936 --> 00:06:08,103
you get a new set
of GPS coordinates.

127
00:06:08,105 --> 00:06:11,473
And that means that you've
completed a stage, or a portal.

128
00:06:11,475 --> 00:06:13,509
And last night,
I was on Portal Ten.

129
00:06:13,511 --> 00:06:15,711
And...

130
00:06:17,014 --> 00:06:18,313
You know what?

131
00:06:18,315 --> 00:06:20,015
I want to talk
to Sherlock and Joan.

132
00:06:20,017 --> 00:06:21,917
Look, Mr. Emple...
No, I'm sorry.

133
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,019
I told the police down
at the factory that I know them.

134
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:25,287
Isn't that the whole reason

135
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:26,922
that I was brought here
to this squad?

136
00:06:26,924 --> 00:06:30,392
I-I am not saying another word
until they are here.

137
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:35,264
Harlan Emple is
indeed an acquaintance.

138
00:06:35,266 --> 00:06:37,733
He is, in point of fact,
one of my “irregulars.”

139
00:06:37,735 --> 00:06:38,801
One of your what?

140
00:06:38,803 --> 00:06:40,302
Irregulars.

141
00:06:40,304 --> 00:06:41,770
I'm your consultant, Captain;
they are mine.

142
00:06:41,772 --> 00:06:43,572
They're a handful
of experts I turn to

143
00:06:43,574 --> 00:06:46,108
when I encounter problems which
are beyond my pool of knowledge.

144
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,810
Harlan is
a brilliant mathematician.

145
00:06:47,812 --> 00:06:49,778
And on the handful of occasions
I have tackled a case

146
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,046
which pertained
to mathematics...

147
00:06:51,048 --> 00:06:53,182
He helped you out.
Well, the good news

148
00:06:53,184 --> 00:06:56,018
for him is the preliminary
autopsy report just came in

149
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,252
before you got here.

150
00:06:57,254 --> 00:06:59,021
And the M.E. puts
the time of death

151
00:06:59,023 --> 00:07:00,989
between 4:00 and
6:00 p.m. last night.

152
00:07:00,991 --> 00:07:02,124
Mr. Emple was teaching

153
00:07:02,126 --> 00:07:03,358
a class at Columbia.

154
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,394
So the victim is
yet to be identified?

155
00:07:05,396 --> 00:07:07,663
No I.D., no phone.

156
00:07:07,665 --> 00:07:09,865
First detective on the scene
liked it for a mob hit,

157
00:07:09,867 --> 00:07:11,500
so while we're
running the prints,

158
00:07:11,502 --> 00:07:13,602
he's showing the vic's
face around OCID.

159
00:07:13,604 --> 00:07:16,839
Marcus here was about to walk
the scene with Mr. Emple.

160
00:07:16,841 --> 00:07:18,774
You're here now;
you might as well tag along.

161
00:07:18,776 --> 00:07:21,009
Actually, Captain,
I'm quite busy today.

162
00:07:21,011 --> 00:07:22,978
This is a John Doe,
and we got nothing.

163
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,247
And, like you just said,
you're my consultant.

164
00:07:25,249 --> 00:07:26,748
So, go consult.

165
00:07:29,787 --> 00:07:30,986
Watson.

166
00:07:30,988 --> 00:07:32,588
Um, he's your friend.

167
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,523
Actually, Kitty is
otherwise engaged,

168
00:07:34,525 --> 00:07:37,426
and he did actually help both
of us with a case last year.

169
00:07:37,428 --> 00:07:38,493
Did he not?

170
00:07:40,865 --> 00:07:44,099
Have I told you
how good it is to see you?

171
00:07:44,101 --> 00:07:45,367
Yes, you have.
Three times.

172
00:07:45,369 --> 00:07:46,468
Well, it is.

173
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,636
Hey, lousy circumstances.

174
00:07:47,638 --> 00:07:49,371
But, uh, hey...

175
00:07:49,373 --> 00:07:51,740
I heard from your boss that you
just, uh, got back from London.

176
00:07:51,742 --> 00:07:53,308
Were you working
a case or...?

177
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,576
No, I moved back there.

178
00:07:54,578 --> 00:07:55,677
You mean<i> moved,</i> moved?

179
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:56,845
Is there another
definition?

180
00:07:56,847 --> 00:07:58,513
I was there for
eight months,

181
00:07:58,515 --> 00:08:00,883
and had a change of heart
and returned to New York.

182
00:08:00,885 --> 00:08:02,517
So, you moved to London,
and you didn't, uh...

183
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,086
You know what?
Doesn't even matter.

184
00:08:04,088 --> 00:08:05,387
The point is you're back!

185
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:07,389
Mr. Emple.
Uh, duty calls.

186
00:08:07,391 --> 00:08:09,024
Yeah.

187
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:18,634
It's interesting.

188
00:08:18,636 --> 00:08:20,068
Mothballs are interesting?

189
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,070
They were taken from
that cabinet over there.

190
00:08:22,072 --> 00:08:25,941
Obviously, to cover the smell
of John Doe's decay.

191
00:08:25,943 --> 00:08:28,043
The killer didn't
bring them with him.

192
00:08:28,045 --> 00:08:31,179
Perhaps leaving the body here
was not part of his plan, hmm?

193
00:08:32,983 --> 00:08:36,018
Doe was shot in the foot
first and then the knee.

194
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,453
Either those were
two really bad misses or...

195
00:08:38,455 --> 00:08:41,256
Or the killer was torturing him.

196
00:08:41,258 --> 00:08:43,892
This doesn't seem like anything
you can't handle on your own.

197
00:08:43,894 --> 00:08:45,994
So you want to tell me why you
really asked me to come here?

198
00:08:45,996 --> 00:08:48,363
“This doesn't seem like anything
you can't handle on your own.”

199
00:08:48,365 --> 00:08:49,765
That's funny.

200
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:51,566
That's exactly what
I would have said

201
00:08:51,568 --> 00:08:53,602
had I been present when you
asked Kitty for her assistance

202
00:08:53,604 --> 00:08:54,937
with your tawdry side job.

203
00:08:54,939 --> 00:08:57,372
“Tawdry”?
I wanted you to know I approve.

204
00:08:57,374 --> 00:08:59,007
Of what?

205
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:01,376
Your agenda
with regards to Kitty.

206
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:03,078
Several days ago,
I gave you her file.

207
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,913
And then you show up at
the brownstone yesterday,

208
00:09:04,915 --> 00:09:06,515
and you invite her
into an investigation.

209
00:09:06,517 --> 00:09:08,183
Coincidence? No, I think not.

210
00:09:08,185 --> 00:09:11,320
You feel for her.
And now you wish to engage.

211
00:09:11,322 --> 00:09:13,956
It's not an outcome
I would have predicted, no.

212
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,458
But it is one
I approve of, yeah.

213
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,193
She could learn
a great deal from you,

214
00:09:18,195 --> 00:09:20,228
especially with regards
to how to get the most

215
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,864
from my tutelage.

216
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:25,734
So, I've already dispatched her
to, uh, follow your Mr. Keswick.

217
00:09:25,736 --> 00:09:27,836
But that's not
what I actually...

218
00:09:27,838 --> 00:09:29,404
Harlan!

219
00:09:30,741 --> 00:09:33,075
You came here to retrieve
a phone number, did you not?

220
00:09:33,077 --> 00:09:34,609
You would send a text,
and then receive

221
00:09:34,611 --> 00:09:36,845
the next clue in the game
that you were playing.

222
00:09:36,847 --> 00:09:38,747
Yeah, but I didn't find it.

223
00:09:38,749 --> 00:09:40,048
Not that I kept looking

224
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,250
after the dead guy
fell out of the locker.

225
00:09:42,252 --> 00:09:44,052
Yeah, CSU didn't find
any number either.

226
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:46,154
Probably because
it's under that paint.

227
00:09:46,156 --> 00:09:48,190
It's fresh.

228
00:09:48,192 --> 00:09:49,891
Applied in the last

229
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:52,694
24 hours.

230
00:09:52,696 --> 00:09:54,696
Right after John Doe's murder,
I'd wager.

231
00:09:54,698 --> 00:09:57,099
You don't think
this was a mob hit?

232
00:09:57,101 --> 00:09:59,101
Doe and the killer were
playing the game, too.

233
00:09:59,103 --> 00:10:01,203
The killer shot Doe and
then covered up the number

234
00:10:01,205 --> 00:10:02,704
so no one else could use it.

235
00:10:02,706 --> 00:10:04,806
What's the prize
in your little contest?

236
00:10:04,808 --> 00:10:07,576
Well, I'm doing it
mostly for the math.

237
00:10:07,578 --> 00:10:11,480
But, uh, $1,707,071.

238
00:10:11,482 --> 00:10:13,882
It's another
palindromic prime.

239
00:10:13,884 --> 00:10:17,152
Did I not mention the
money at the station?

240
00:10:17,154 --> 00:10:18,587
Who the hell can afford

241
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:20,655
that kind of payout
for a puzzle hunt?

242
00:10:20,657 --> 00:10:22,124
Well, most people
think it's CAML.

243
00:10:22,126 --> 00:10:24,593
The Center for Applied
Mathematics and Logic.

244
00:10:24,595 --> 00:10:26,094
It's located
in Ramapo...

245
00:10:26,096 --> 00:10:27,729
Wait, most people
“think” it's them?

246
00:10:27,731 --> 00:10:29,331
Well, hunts like these,

247
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,266
the organizers are
almost always anonymous.

248
00:10:31,268 --> 00:10:32,401
It's S.O.P.

249
00:10:32,403 --> 00:10:34,302
What about the
contestants?

250
00:10:34,304 --> 00:10:37,005
Is anonymity
also S.O.P.?

251
00:10:37,007 --> 00:10:39,207
For the most part, yeah.

252
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:43,078
But, guys, math peeps
are my peeps, okay?

253
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,314
It's, uh, like
a community, sort of.

254
00:10:46,316 --> 00:10:48,984
I can think of ten
or 12 other people

255
00:10:48,986 --> 00:10:50,018
who were probably competing.

256
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,186
Would that help?

257
00:10:53,157 --> 00:10:55,223
No.

258
00:10:55,225 --> 00:10:58,026
I'm sorry, I don't know him.

259
00:10:58,028 --> 00:11:00,862
But you admit you were
competing in Belphegor's Prime.

260
00:11:00,864 --> 00:11:02,197
I do.

261
00:11:04,835 --> 00:11:05,934
Pepe!

262
00:11:08,172 --> 00:11:10,439
Sorry. He doesn't
like strangers.

263
00:11:12,109 --> 00:11:14,443
Give him one of these.

264
00:11:14,445 --> 00:11:16,111
Get on his good side.

265
00:11:24,288 --> 00:11:26,354
What are you doing?

266
00:11:28,225 --> 00:11:30,725
I'm just verifying that
you've been lying to us.

267
00:11:30,727 --> 00:11:33,895
You did know the
dead man, did you not?

268
00:11:33,897 --> 00:11:36,998
I reviewed his personal
effects at the morgue earlier.

269
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,034
The coroner reported finding
crumbs in one of his pockets.

270
00:11:39,036 --> 00:11:40,036
I tasted one.

271
00:11:40,037 --> 00:11:41,269
Why would you...?

272
00:11:41,271 --> 00:11:42,771
At first, I thought
they were from

273
00:11:42,773 --> 00:11:44,439
a particularly rancid
brand of cheese,

274
00:11:44,441 --> 00:11:47,609
but, no... they're from
one of Pepe's treats.

275
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:49,277
Homemade?

276
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,481
Harlan was able to give us
the names of nine other people

277
00:11:52,483 --> 00:11:54,149
he believed to be
other competitors.

278
00:11:54,151 --> 00:11:55,984
Our colleagues are
investigating them as we speak,

279
00:11:55,986 --> 00:11:57,919
but I'll quite happily
recommend that the NYPD

280
00:11:57,921 --> 00:12:00,222
focus its attention
entirely on you.

281
00:12:04,128 --> 00:12:06,428
His name was Ike Walaczek.

282
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,231
In another lifetime,
he was my boyfriend.

283
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:10,866
And what of
this lifetime?

284
00:12:10,868 --> 00:12:12,701
We were working together.

285
00:12:12,703 --> 00:12:14,769
On Belphegor's.
What?!

286
00:12:14,771 --> 00:12:16,705
He was a numerical analyst
at the Tory Foundation.

287
00:12:16,707 --> 00:12:17,873
I work mostly in combinatorics.

288
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,307
I thought we would make
a good team.

289
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:20,742
But there aren't
supposed to be teams.

290
00:12:20,744 --> 00:12:22,711
Not in a puzzle hunt.
It's bad form.

291
00:12:22,713 --> 00:12:23,713
Harlan...

292
00:12:23,714 --> 00:12:25,514
I'm just saying...

293
00:12:25,516 --> 00:12:27,315
My husband
wouldn't understand,

294
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:30,385
so I decided I wouldn't tell him
until after we won the money.

295
00:12:30,387 --> 00:12:33,121
A team-- so that's how
you got there before me.

296
00:12:33,123 --> 00:12:34,489
I wasn't there.

297
00:12:34,491 --> 00:12:36,258
Tom and I were out of town
until this morning.

298
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,126
His cousin
was getting married in Hawaii.

299
00:12:38,128 --> 00:12:40,662
That's why Ike went
to the coordinates by himself.

300
00:12:40,664 --> 00:12:42,097
Because I couldn't.

301
00:12:44,268 --> 00:12:46,601
These are pictures I took.

302
00:12:46,603 --> 00:12:49,337
Check the dates.

303
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:51,506
You gave the police
nine other names?

304
00:12:51,508 --> 00:12:53,408
People you thought
were competing?

305
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,776
I've got 16.

306
00:12:54,778 --> 00:12:56,311
And I know they were competing.

307
00:12:58,448 --> 00:13:01,249
He talked to her
outside the Jamaica property

308
00:13:01,251 --> 00:13:05,720
for about 20 minutes,
and then this truck rolled up.

309
00:13:05,722 --> 00:13:07,822
Any idea what's
inside the crate?

310
00:13:07,824 --> 00:13:09,024
Nope.

311
00:13:09,026 --> 00:13:10,392
I can't identify
the woman either.

312
00:13:10,394 --> 00:13:12,260
Everything about her
said money though.

313
00:13:12,262 --> 00:13:15,363
She, Keswick
and the mystery box

314
00:13:15,365 --> 00:13:17,732
stayed inside the building
for about three hours,

315
00:13:17,734 --> 00:13:20,001
and then off they went.

316
00:13:20,904 --> 00:13:22,170
Good.

317
00:13:22,172 --> 00:13:23,872
Okay.

318
00:13:23,874 --> 00:13:26,074
You know where
to send the check.

319
00:13:26,076 --> 00:13:30,145
You haven't asked me about
the file Sherlock gave me.

320
00:13:30,147 --> 00:13:32,080
Why would I?

321
00:13:32,082 --> 00:13:36,184
You said it would give me
a better sense of you-- it did.

322
00:13:37,588 --> 00:13:40,155
That's why you asked
for my help.

323
00:13:40,157 --> 00:13:41,990
Because you felt sorry for me.

324
00:13:41,992 --> 00:13:44,226
No.

325
00:13:44,228 --> 00:13:46,194
You just don't seem interested
in anything

326
00:13:46,196 --> 00:13:48,063
outside of becoming
a detective.

327
00:13:48,065 --> 00:13:50,999
There she is.

328
00:13:51,001 --> 00:13:53,301
The old counselor.

329
00:13:53,303 --> 00:13:55,637
Who used to hold
Sherlock's hand.

330
00:13:57,608 --> 00:13:59,741
Everything that you read,

331
00:13:59,743 --> 00:14:02,510
everything that happened to me,
that's all it is.

332
00:14:02,512 --> 00:14:04,646
It's just something
that happened.

333
00:14:04,648 --> 00:14:08,116
And it's all
in the past now.

334
00:14:08,118 --> 00:14:10,685
So let's just
leave it there, shall we?

335
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:24,667
Hello.

336
00:14:24,668 --> 00:14:26,001
You've had sex.

337
00:14:26,003 --> 00:14:27,202
Excuse me?

338
00:14:27,204 --> 00:14:28,503
I can hear it
in your voice.

339
00:14:28,505 --> 00:14:29,771
You've joined paunches.

340
00:14:29,773 --> 00:14:30,972
Good for you, Watson.

341
00:14:30,974 --> 00:14:32,807
As you know, I think
the act of love

342
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:34,676
can be quite conducive to...
What do you want?

343
00:14:34,678 --> 00:14:36,911
Merely to apprise you
of a new development

344
00:14:36,913 --> 00:14:38,280
in the murder of
Ike Walaczek.

345
00:14:38,282 --> 00:14:40,115
As I informed
you yesterday,

346
00:14:40,117 --> 00:14:42,284
Harlan and I were given
a new list of competitors.

347
00:14:42,286 --> 00:14:45,320
One name leapt out:
Byron Lowenthal.

348
00:14:45,322 --> 00:14:48,156
He's a statistician at the
Public Utilities Commission

349
00:14:48,158 --> 00:14:50,425
and a diagnosed
paranoid schizophrenic.

350
00:14:50,427 --> 00:14:52,160
He's been hospitalized
for becoming violent

351
00:14:52,162 --> 00:14:53,728
on no fewer
than three occasions.

352
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,964
Certainly sounds like
it could be our guy.

353
00:14:55,966 --> 00:14:59,367
Unfortunately, Mr. Lowenthal had
another break earlier this year.

354
00:14:59,369 --> 00:15:02,137
He's been staying in
a transient hotel ever since.

355
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:04,239
Detective Bell and I
are going to speak with him.

356
00:15:04,241 --> 00:15:05,307
You want me to meet you?

357
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:06,875
Oh, no, we're already here.

358
00:15:06,877 --> 00:15:08,410
Anyway, now that I know
that you've enjoyed coitus

359
00:15:08,412 --> 00:15:09,778
and could enjoy more
in the near future...

360
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,846
When you're done,
we need to talk.

361
00:15:14,718 --> 00:15:16,818
Byron Lowenthal,
you in there?

362
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,053
Who is it?

363
00:15:18,055 --> 00:15:19,754
It's Detective Bell, NYPD.

364
00:15:19,756 --> 00:15:22,257
My colleague and I would like
to ask you some questions.

365
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:24,592
Let me
get some pants on.

366
00:15:37,341 --> 00:15:40,008
S-Sorry, I just... I, um...

367
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,310
I-I thought I heard
Mr. Lowenthal retr...

368
00:16:19,154 --> 00:16:21,267
You guys got lucky.

369
00:16:21,268 --> 00:16:22,868
Well, luck had little
to do with it, actually.

370
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,536
I... I heard Mr. Lowenthal

371
00:16:24,538 --> 00:16:27,039
pulling a heavy object off
a shelf, placing it on his bed,

372
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,041
and the sound of
the zipper indicated

373
00:16:29,043 --> 00:16:30,976
that it was
a large gun case.

374
00:16:30,978 --> 00:16:33,579
Looks like he was sane enough
to do math, but not much else.

375
00:16:33,581 --> 00:16:34,747
Plus, he was
pretty hopped up.

376
00:16:34,749 --> 00:16:36,448
Caffeine pills,
energy drinks,

377
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,251
pretty much every legal
stimulant you can buy.

378
00:16:39,253 --> 00:16:40,853
Plus a few illegal ones.

379
00:16:40,855 --> 00:16:42,821
Hmm. Obviously, he was
keeping himself awake

380
00:16:42,823 --> 00:16:44,490
so he could work on
Belphegor's.

381
00:16:44,492 --> 00:16:47,392
This... is obvious to you?

382
00:16:47,394 --> 00:16:48,961
I confess the maths
are beyond me,

383
00:16:48,963 --> 00:16:51,130
but I took the liberty of
sending pictures of what

384
00:16:51,132 --> 00:16:52,865
appear to be Mr. Lowenthal's
most recent scribbles

385
00:16:52,867 --> 00:16:54,166
to Harlan Emple,
and he's confirmed

386
00:16:54,168 --> 00:16:55,667
they are part of the contest.

387
00:16:55,669 --> 00:16:56,969
With your permission,
I'd like copies of these

388
00:16:56,971 --> 00:16:58,837
sent to my home
so he can review them.

389
00:16:58,839 --> 00:16:59,972
What for?

390
00:16:59,974 --> 00:17:01,073
If Byron Lowenthal

391
00:17:01,075 --> 00:17:02,441
did kill Ike Walaczek,

392
00:17:02,443 --> 00:17:04,109
then he used
and obscured a phone number,

393
00:17:04,111 --> 00:17:05,878
which would have yielded
the next problem.

394
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,379
That problem's solution

395
00:17:07,381 --> 00:17:08,714
would be GPS coordinates.

396
00:17:08,716 --> 00:17:10,415
If he's recorded them
in his books...

397
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:12,551
Your pal will be able to tell us
where he's headed next.

398
00:17:12,553 --> 00:17:14,853
I'll get our guys to give you

399
00:17:14,855 --> 00:17:16,388
whatever you need.

400
00:17:17,258 --> 00:17:18,991
Scans are still coming through,

401
00:17:18,993 --> 00:17:21,260
but I've put what we've got
so far up on the wall.

402
00:17:21,262 --> 00:17:23,262
Sherlock said that
you prefer it that way.

403
00:17:23,264 --> 00:17:25,030
Picked it up from him,
actually.

404
00:17:25,032 --> 00:17:28,600
Makes me feel like I'm really
inside of the problem.

405
00:17:30,704 --> 00:17:33,372
I'll, uh, let you know
if I need anything.

406
00:17:34,275 --> 00:17:35,974
Oh, I work without a shirt.

407
00:17:35,976 --> 00:17:38,911
Sometimes makes me feel
closer to the numbers.

408
00:17:38,913 --> 00:17:42,147
You'll need to, uh,
check the printer in the study

409
00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:43,615
for more pages.

410
00:17:43,617 --> 00:17:45,417
Uh, this is nice,
you know?

411
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:47,452
Meeting another member
of the team.

412
00:17:47,454 --> 00:17:48,654
You know, Team Sherlock.

413
00:17:48,656 --> 00:17:50,656
You help him, I help him...

414
00:17:51,926 --> 00:17:53,559
Obviously, you haven't
tackled a case

415
00:17:53,561 --> 00:17:55,093
with high-order math since
you started working with him,

416
00:17:55,095 --> 00:17:57,729
or we would've...

417
00:17:57,731 --> 00:17:59,031
What?

418
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:00,232
What?

419
00:18:00,234 --> 00:18:01,834
Wait...

420
00:18:01,836 --> 00:18:04,002
have you worked a case
with high-order math?

421
00:18:04,805 --> 00:18:06,238
You have, haven't you?

422
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,840
Does it matter?

423
00:18:07,842 --> 00:18:09,842
Of course it...

424
00:18:09,844 --> 00:18:11,443
Oh, my God.

425
00:18:11,445 --> 00:18:13,278
Did he fire me?

426
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,980
All I know
is that back in London,

427
00:18:14,982 --> 00:18:16,982
we worked a case that involved
Fibonacci spirals...

428
00:18:16,984 --> 00:18:18,483
He fired me.

429
00:18:18,485 --> 00:18:21,386
...and he called some woman
named Indira Patel.

430
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,856
She's at Berkeley.

431
00:18:23,858 --> 00:18:25,624
I'm three time zones closer!

432
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:27,125
You're here now.

433
00:18:27,127 --> 00:18:29,428
Sure, because I found
a dead body.

434
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,531
I have to go; I have to run
some errands for Sherlock.

435
00:18:35,936 --> 00:18:37,903
I-I don't know
what was in the crate,

436
00:18:37,905 --> 00:18:39,271
but the stenciling on
the side indicates

437
00:18:39,273 --> 00:18:40,772
it came from one of
the SUNY schools.

438
00:18:40,774 --> 00:18:42,908
I put another detective
on Keswick...

439
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:45,177
Don't kill me, I had to
use your razor to shave.

440
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:47,179
I...

441
00:18:47,181 --> 00:18:49,147
You must be Andrew.

442
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:50,515
Sherlock Holmes.

443
00:18:50,517 --> 00:18:52,551
Sorry.

444
00:18:52,553 --> 00:18:55,487
Joan said you were coming;
I... I forgot.

445
00:18:55,489 --> 00:18:57,122
It's not how
I wanted to meet you.

446
00:18:57,124 --> 00:18:58,891
She said you can tell
a lot about people

447
00:18:58,893 --> 00:19:00,192
just by looking at them.

448
00:19:00,194 --> 00:19:02,261
I swear, I...
usually wear pants.

449
00:19:02,263 --> 00:19:03,729
Well, in my experience,
most people

450
00:19:03,731 --> 00:19:05,264
need only be concerned
I won't notice

451
00:19:05,266 --> 00:19:06,498
anything worth remarking upon.

452
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:10,535
Watson seems adequately sexed.

453
00:19:11,939 --> 00:19:13,672
Hey.

454
00:19:13,674 --> 00:19:15,674
I was just introducing myself.

455
00:19:17,945 --> 00:19:20,379
I've got that thing.
I'll see you tonight.

456
00:19:20,381 --> 00:19:21,580
Okay.

457
00:19:27,855 --> 00:19:30,188
Your home, Watson...

458
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,823
it's utterly pleasant.

459
00:19:31,825 --> 00:19:33,692
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

460
00:19:33,694 --> 00:19:35,394
When you told me
you wanted a life of your own,

461
00:19:35,396 --> 00:19:36,595
I didn't realize
that you meant you wanted

462
00:19:36,597 --> 00:19:38,030
the same life everyone else has.

463
00:19:38,032 --> 00:19:39,464
But at any rate,
none of my business, is it?

464
00:19:39,466 --> 00:19:41,233
It's not.
And I didn't ask you here

465
00:19:41,235 --> 00:19:42,634
to talk about my apartment.

466
00:19:42,636 --> 00:19:44,970
No, you asked me here
to discuss Kitty.

467
00:19:44,972 --> 00:19:46,471
If she were not
the topic of conversation,

468
00:19:46,473 --> 00:19:48,941
then you wouldn't have
invited me to your home,

469
00:19:48,943 --> 00:19:50,776
where there's no chance
she'll be present.

470
00:19:52,346 --> 00:19:53,946
She disappointed you
in some way.

471
00:19:53,948 --> 00:19:55,247
Skills not up to snuff?

472
00:19:55,249 --> 00:19:57,316
Please remember
she is a novice.

473
00:19:57,318 --> 00:19:58,850
Actually, she did a great job.

474
00:19:58,852 --> 00:20:00,285
But I have some concerns.

475
00:20:00,287 --> 00:20:01,954
I thought we could
talk about them.

476
00:20:03,757 --> 00:20:04,923
You think that
Kitty needs help

477
00:20:04,925 --> 00:20:06,091
above and beyond
my mentorship.

478
00:20:06,093 --> 00:20:07,392
You read the same
file I did.

479
00:20:07,394 --> 00:20:08,894
She's a rape victim.

480
00:20:08,896 --> 00:20:11,296
She was kept and tortured.

481
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,899
Mm.

482
00:20:16,136 --> 00:20:19,171
You know me, so surely you know

483
00:20:19,173 --> 00:20:22,874
I've broached the subject of
a support group meeting before.

484
00:20:22,876 --> 00:20:25,010
Even offered
to pay for therapy.

485
00:20:25,012 --> 00:20:26,812
She's not interested, I know.

486
00:20:26,814 --> 00:20:28,447
Just as you also know

487
00:20:28,449 --> 00:20:30,749
someone with a problem
can't be forced to get help.

488
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:32,551
They have to want it.

489
00:20:32,553 --> 00:20:34,786
What Kitty wants
is to be a detective.

490
00:20:36,523 --> 00:20:38,490
I am taking pains
to try and channel

491
00:20:38,492 --> 00:20:40,592
her residual feelings
into her work.

492
00:20:42,329 --> 00:20:44,463
Well, that works out
great for you.

493
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:48,400
You told me that
you took on a partner

494
00:20:48,402 --> 00:20:50,635
because you wanted to replicate
what you and I had.

495
00:20:50,637 --> 00:20:52,637
That you thought it helped
with your recovery.

496
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:54,539
You think I would
try and take advantage

497
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,208
of the victim of a trauma?

498
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,910
Of course not, but there is
a conflict of interest here.

499
00:20:58,912 --> 00:21:02,447
She needs what she needs,
but you need what you need, too.

500
00:21:06,053 --> 00:21:10,055
It's-it's good that you're
in her life now, Watson.

501
00:21:10,057 --> 00:21:12,524
I mean,
it's commonly believed that, um,

502
00:21:12,526 --> 00:21:16,228
a child benefits mostly from
the presence of two parents.

503
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,164
He-- or she, in this case--
can absorb certain qualities

504
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,466
from the father--
clear-eyed view of the world,

505
00:21:21,468 --> 00:21:23,168
capacity of
rational thought, etcetera.

506
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,170
They can also absorb certain
qualities from the mother.

507
00:21:25,172 --> 00:21:27,105
Excuse me, but I am not
Kitty's mother,

508
00:21:27,107 --> 00:21:28,807
and she sure as hell
is not our child.

509
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:30,942
You brought her here;
she looks up to you.

510
00:21:30,944 --> 00:21:32,944
She says that she doesn't
need help-- fine--

511
00:21:32,946 --> 00:21:34,579
but you know better.

512
00:21:34,581 --> 00:21:37,082
And you're gonna have to be
the one that tells her.

513
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,620
It's Harlan.

514
00:21:41,622 --> 00:21:44,523
Making progress with the maths.

515
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,660
We thought
that Byron and Ike

516
00:21:48,662 --> 00:21:50,462
arrived at Portal Ten
simultaneously.

517
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,664
That would've meant that they
were doing all the same math

518
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,032
at essentially
the same time.

519
00:21:54,034 --> 00:21:56,001
Only, the math
you found at Byron's place

520
00:21:56,003 --> 00:21:57,003
says that's wrong.

521
00:21:57,004 --> 00:21:58,470
He was one step behind Ike.

522
00:21:58,472 --> 00:22:00,705
Are you proposing he did
not kill Mr. Walaczek?

523
00:22:00,707 --> 00:22:03,175
I don't know, but that's
not the weirdest part.

524
00:22:03,177 --> 00:22:04,810
Byron was obsessive.

525
00:22:04,812 --> 00:22:06,211
He time-stamped
almost everything he did.

526
00:22:06,213 --> 00:22:09,047
He only solved
the Portal Nine problem,

527
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:11,316
the same problem that sent me
to that old factory last night.

528
00:22:11,318 --> 00:22:12,884
But get this--

529
00:22:12,886 --> 00:22:14,686
he wasn't given
the same problem as me.

530
00:22:14,688 --> 00:22:16,655
And so it would've yielded
GPS coordinates

531
00:22:16,657 --> 00:22:18,323
for an entirely
different location.

532
00:22:18,325 --> 00:22:21,760
The person in charge of
the game changed the clue

533
00:22:21,762 --> 00:22:23,328
after the police
found Ike's body.

534
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:25,964
Well, he had to, right?

535
00:22:25,966 --> 00:22:27,899
If he hadn't, he would be
sending other competitors

536
00:22:27,901 --> 00:22:29,101
to an active crime scene.

537
00:22:29,103 --> 00:22:30,402
The important thing is

538
00:22:30,404 --> 00:22:31,536
I figured out the coordinates

539
00:22:31,538 --> 00:22:32,771
to the second location.

540
00:22:32,773 --> 00:22:35,540
I know where Byron went.

541
00:22:35,542 --> 00:22:36,842
What are you doing?

542
00:22:36,844 --> 00:22:38,410
You're saying he
time-stamped everything.

543
00:22:38,412 --> 00:22:40,345
I'm looking at the time
he received his clues.

544
00:22:40,347 --> 00:22:42,647
It's all there, to the second,
but what does that have to do...

545
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:44,149
What if you hadn't
found a body?

546
00:22:44,151 --> 00:22:46,118
If the game had
proceeded as planned,

547
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,486
what were you meant
to do there?

548
00:22:47,488 --> 00:22:49,354
I would have sent a text
to the phone number,

549
00:22:49,356 --> 00:22:51,523
the one that the killer painted
over, and then I would have

550
00:22:51,525 --> 00:22:52,891
gotten a message back
with the next problem.

551
00:22:52,893 --> 00:22:54,559
There's an extra
step in there.

552
00:22:54,561 --> 00:22:56,428
Why all this rigmarole with
phone numbers and texts?

553
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,064
Why not just post the problem
itself at the factory?

554
00:22:59,066 --> 00:23:02,100
I don't know, it's just the way
the game is played.

555
00:23:02,102 --> 00:23:04,102
They're for an old
industrial area in Queens.

556
00:23:04,104 --> 00:23:06,805
You're welcome
for finding your suspect.

557
00:23:06,807 --> 00:23:09,207
If I'm right, Harlan,
what you've found...

558
00:23:09,209 --> 00:23:11,109
is the site of
another murder.

559
00:23:11,111 --> 00:23:13,245
Byron Lowenthal's.

560
00:23:15,983 --> 00:23:18,216
You were right,
Lowenthal's dead.

561
00:23:18,218 --> 00:23:20,952
He was shot in the foot,
then the knee.

562
00:23:20,954 --> 00:23:22,821
Just like
Ike Wallaczek.

563
00:23:22,823 --> 00:23:26,391
I'm, uh, gonna look
over here now.

564
00:23:26,393 --> 00:23:29,427
Well, we think the perp
was pulling the body

565
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:31,429
to a car that was parked
over there.

566
00:23:31,431 --> 00:23:34,065
Then he just
left him here.

567
00:23:34,067 --> 00:23:35,901
Probably afraid
he'd been spotted.

568
00:23:35,903 --> 00:23:38,803
There's a lot
of homeless in the area.

569
00:23:41,441 --> 00:23:43,008
Question is:

570
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:45,010
how'd you know
Lowenthal was the next victim

571
00:23:45,012 --> 00:23:46,511
and not the killer?

572
00:23:49,316 --> 00:23:51,750
Well, that's
quite simple, really.

573
00:23:51,752 --> 00:23:54,352
The game is directing
its players to remote locales,

574
00:23:54,354 --> 00:23:56,788
and then instructing them
to send a text message

575
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,256
indicating their presence.

576
00:23:58,258 --> 00:24:00,125
I suspect the killer wanted
to remove the body

577
00:24:00,127 --> 00:24:02,928
so he could keep this new
location “in play,” so to speak.

578
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:05,130
Still missing the “simple” part.

579
00:24:05,132 --> 00:24:06,698
The late Mr. Lowenthal

580
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,366
received his final clue

581
00:24:08,368 --> 00:24:10,235
after Harlan discovered
Ike Wallaczek's body,

582
00:24:10,237 --> 00:24:12,737
but before news of the killing
had reached the media.

583
00:24:12,739 --> 00:24:14,439
That means the
game's designer

584
00:24:14,441 --> 00:24:16,408
knew the location
had been compromised.

585
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,577
And the only way
that he could have known that,

586
00:24:18,579 --> 00:24:20,111
at the time that he knew it,

587
00:24:20,113 --> 00:24:21,880
was if he, himself,
was the killer.

588
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,917
Belphegor's Prime is not
a treasure hunt.

589
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,619
It's a trap.

590
00:24:40,696 --> 00:24:42,196
Better?

591
00:24:42,198 --> 00:24:44,665
False alarm.

592
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:47,668
But I still feel
a little queasy.

593
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,273
This new dead guy--

594
00:24:52,275 --> 00:24:54,875
your friend said that he was
tortured, too, right?

595
00:24:54,877 --> 00:24:57,244
Right before the killer tried
to abscond with his corpse.

596
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:59,213
I assume
he intended to take

597
00:24:59,215 --> 00:25:02,383
Ike Wallaczek away with him
as well, only Ike was too large.

598
00:25:02,385 --> 00:25:04,685
A speedy mothballing
was the best he could do.

599
00:25:04,687 --> 00:25:07,221
So, just to recap,

600
00:25:07,223 --> 00:25:09,657
I've spent the last
few months of my life

601
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:13,360
playing a game that was
designed to kill me.

602
00:25:13,362 --> 00:25:15,629
Got to be a metaphor
in there somewhere, right?

603
00:25:15,631 --> 00:25:18,966
I think the word you're
looking for is “moral.”

604
00:25:18,968 --> 00:25:21,902
There is a moral in there:
games are for idiots.

605
00:25:24,707 --> 00:25:26,473
Breaking news from Ramapo.

606
00:25:26,475 --> 00:25:29,443
Kitty reports the Center for
Applied Mathematics and Logic

607
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,912
is not the sponsor
of Belphegor's Prime.

608
00:25:31,914 --> 00:25:34,148
Then it's got to be
a serial killer, right?

609
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,716
Someone who's obsessed
with mathematicians?

610
00:25:35,718 --> 00:25:37,284
Mm.

611
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,920
Perhaps he was bullied
by mathematicians as a child.

612
00:25:39,922 --> 00:25:42,056
Or mathematicians
killed his parents.

613
00:25:42,058 --> 00:25:43,657
I'm being serious.

614
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:45,726
Serial killers who devise
elaborate death traps

615
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,461
are the stuff of pulp fiction.

616
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:49,229
And besides, with respect
to these murders,

617
00:25:49,231 --> 00:25:51,165
there are none
of the elaborations

618
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:53,767
which mark that sort of culprit.

619
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:55,970
If anything, I would describe
the work as businesslike.

620
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:58,172
Then it's the government.

621
00:25:58,174 --> 00:26:01,241
I mean, the-the game was some
sort of test to weed out people

622
00:26:01,243 --> 00:26:03,243
who could weaponize math.

623
00:26:03,245 --> 00:26:05,179
The American intelligence
apparatus may be clod-like,

624
00:26:05,181 --> 00:26:07,014
but I think they would
do a better job

625
00:26:07,016 --> 00:26:08,749
of disposing of two bodies,
don't you?

626
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:11,785
Watson?

627
00:26:11,787 --> 00:26:13,621
I just heard
from one of the suspects

628
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:14,922
Marcus and I talked to
yesterday,

629
00:26:14,924 --> 00:26:16,290
another puzzle-hunter.

630
00:26:16,292 --> 00:26:18,525
Tell me he confessed
to the murders.

631
00:26:18,527 --> 00:26:20,427
We ruled him out right away,
but he heard about

632
00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:22,329
Byron Lowenthal's murder on
the news and wanted me to know

633
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:25,165
he's at a friend's place,
some guy named Paul.

634
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,934
That is fascinating.

635
00:26:26,936 --> 00:26:28,369
Actually, it might be.

636
00:26:28,371 --> 00:26:31,038
Paul is positive he knows
who the killer is.

637
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,807
I know the guards
are a bit much,

638
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:35,509
but I wanted everyone
to feel safe.

639
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:38,178
And, besides,
math has been good to me.

640
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,279
Commodities.

641
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:40,848
So, you and your friends,

642
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:43,150
you were competitors
in Belphegor's Prime?

643
00:26:43,152 --> 00:26:45,352
Most of us. Some of the others
are just here for the math.

644
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,121
You said you could
identify the killer.

645
00:26:47,123 --> 00:26:49,323
I can, sort of.

646
00:26:52,061 --> 00:26:54,194
“Mo Shellshocker.”

647
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:56,930
It's a pseudonym,
obviously, but I'm telling you,

648
00:26:56,932 --> 00:26:58,365
this is the guy
you're looking for.

649
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,600
I've heard of him.

650
00:26:59,602 --> 00:27:01,335
He uses his blog
to expose bad math.

651
00:27:01,337 --> 00:27:03,837
Corrupt economists, biased
pollsters, that sort of thing.

652
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:05,572
He's actually
sort of a crusader.

653
00:27:05,574 --> 00:27:06,574
He's a murderer.

654
00:27:06,575 --> 00:27:09,143
How can you be
so sure?

655
00:27:09,145 --> 00:27:10,744
When he isn't crusading,
he's competing in puzzle hunts.

656
00:27:10,746 --> 00:27:11,812
A few months ago,

657
00:27:11,814 --> 00:27:13,080
he claimed to
have solved

658
00:27:13,082 --> 00:27:14,815
Cicada 3301 two
years in a row.

659
00:27:14,817 --> 00:27:17,484
Some people called BS,
including...

660
00:27:17,486 --> 00:27:20,120
Ike Wallaczek
and Byron Lowenthal.

661
00:27:20,122 --> 00:27:21,221
“WallaCheckYourMath,”

662
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:22,489
“ByLow2020.”

663
00:27:22,491 --> 00:27:23,757
Those are their
online handles.

664
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:25,392
Their friends
will confirm it.

665
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,528
A flame war does not
a murderer make.

666
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:30,097
The stuff these guys were
slinging at each other was ugly.

667
00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:32,099
Mo knew they were into hunts,
and so he built one

668
00:27:32,101 --> 00:27:34,034
that would send them to places
where he could kill them.

669
00:27:34,036 --> 00:27:35,469
That's what we're
doing here is

670
00:27:35,471 --> 00:27:36,837
we're just sifting
through all the math

671
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:38,338
he's posted on his blog
over the years,

672
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,840
to see if we could
find his signature

673
00:27:39,842 --> 00:27:41,975
or something that
could identify him.

674
00:27:41,977 --> 00:27:45,279
If two people weren't dead,
we'd probably be having fun.

675
00:27:45,281 --> 00:27:46,747
But still, the
chances that he left

676
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:48,582
something like that
in his math...

677
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,784
If it's there, we'll find it.
In the meantime,

678
00:27:50,786 --> 00:27:52,186
we thought the
police should know

679
00:27:52,188 --> 00:27:53,687
who they're really
dealing with.

680
00:27:53,689 --> 00:27:55,389
<i>I've got to go meet someone</i>

681
00:27:55,391 --> 00:27:56,924
about my other case.

682
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:59,927
You're good to pass all this
along to Marcus? Okay.

683
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:03,030
I must say, I'm surprised you
didn't offer to stay and help.

684
00:28:03,032 --> 00:28:05,265
Mr. Ettinger makes
a compelling case with respect

685
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,067
to Mo Shellshocker's
viability as a suspect.

686
00:28:07,069 --> 00:28:09,002
Mo is a genius.

687
00:28:09,004 --> 00:28:10,637
We're talking off the charts.

688
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:12,139
Leibniz meets Euler meets Gauss.

689
00:28:12,141 --> 00:28:14,108
Huh.
He may have an ego,

690
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,110
but he's not gonna kill
anyone over a few comments.

691
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:18,312
So, while “The League of
Concerned Mathematician”"

692
00:28:18,314 --> 00:28:21,014
chases its tail up there, I
am gonna do the smart thing

693
00:28:21,016 --> 00:28:22,416
and get out of town.

694
00:28:22,418 --> 00:28:24,485
You can let me know
when it all blows over.

695
00:28:24,487 --> 00:28:26,386
You're not going
anywhere, Harlan.

696
00:28:26,388 --> 00:28:29,223
Or should I call you
Mo Shellshocker?

697
00:28:32,728 --> 00:28:34,661
Did you honestly think
I wouldn't recognize

698
00:28:34,663 --> 00:28:36,130
an anagram of my own name?

699
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:40,567
I knew I should've gone
with “Choker Hell Moss”"

700
00:28:40,569 --> 00:28:42,569
But I never thought
that you would see it, okay?

701
00:28:42,571 --> 00:28:44,104
Math is my thing, not yours.

702
00:28:44,106 --> 00:28:46,473
It's my name, Harlan;
that makes it my thing.

703
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,675
It was an homage.

704
00:28:48,677 --> 00:28:50,043
Explain.

705
00:28:50,045 --> 00:28:52,045
Every day, all over the world,

706
00:28:52,047 --> 00:28:54,348
math is used to trick people.

707
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,917
Data dredging to sell
pharmaceuticals.

708
00:28:56,919 --> 00:28:59,720
Publication bias
to justify wars.

709
00:28:59,722 --> 00:29:02,322
In the wrong hands, math can be
manipulated, abused.

710
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:05,425
And I decided to do
something about it.

711
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:09,596
You catch people
who murder other people.

712
00:29:09,598 --> 00:29:11,431
I catch people who murder math.

713
00:29:11,433 --> 00:29:14,568
According to this,
Mo is a wanted man.

714
00:29:17,606 --> 00:29:19,940
Harlan?

715
00:29:19,942 --> 00:29:23,110
The D.O.D. was working
on a new fighter.

716
00:29:23,112 --> 00:29:27,047
Only, I knew that the
performance stats were bogus.

717
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:29,116
A friend of mine found
the internal numbers,

718
00:29:29,118 --> 00:29:31,251
and I sort of published them.

719
00:29:31,253 --> 00:29:33,320
So you put classified
Department of Defense documents

720
00:29:33,322 --> 00:29:34,888
on the Internet.

721
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:36,623
Isn't that what
you would have done?

722
00:29:38,928 --> 00:29:41,562
Fine! I screwed up, okay?

723
00:29:41,564 --> 00:29:43,730
But, hey, that's what I do,
right? I screw up.

724
00:29:43,732 --> 00:29:46,233
If I didn't, then probably you
wouldn't have secretly fired me.

725
00:29:46,235 --> 00:29:47,968
Excuse me?

726
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,403
I know about Indira Patel!

727
00:29:51,006 --> 00:29:53,340
I know you replaced me.

728
00:29:55,144 --> 00:29:58,979
Kitty, I think
we could use some tea.

729
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:04,318
Just tell me.

730
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,253
Tell me what math I got wrong.

731
00:30:06,255 --> 00:30:09,356
Tell me why you didn't let me
make it up to you.

732
00:30:09,358 --> 00:30:12,926
It wasn't the maths, it was you.

733
00:30:14,763 --> 00:30:18,232
Your work was impeccable.

734
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:20,334
And for the most part,
I enjoyed our collaborations.

735
00:30:20,336 --> 00:30:24,838
B-But over time, you just...
you became quite... needy.

736
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,406
What are you talking about?

737
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:29,109
Y-You asked my advice
on-on social matters,

738
00:30:29,111 --> 00:30:32,512
and you even invited me
to a party.

739
00:30:32,514 --> 00:30:34,648
You were my friend.

740
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,416
I was your employer, Harlan.

741
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:37,918
A-And you were my consultant.

742
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,419
One of many.

743
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:43,757
I know that I'm a little
obsessed with what I do.

744
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:46,960
That has always made it hard
to make friends.

745
00:30:46,962 --> 00:30:50,664
And I used to feel pretty bad
about that, and then I met you.

746
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:52,566
And I thought to myself,

747
00:30:52,568 --> 00:30:55,903
hey, if it doesn't bother him,
why should I let it bother me?

748
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:03,810
I got a lot
out of the work that we did.

749
00:31:03,812 --> 00:31:06,146
A lot.

750
00:31:06,148 --> 00:31:11,218
But if someone like you thinks
that I'm a loser, then...

751
00:31:22,564 --> 00:31:24,965
Hey, are we still doing this?

752
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:26,366
Doing what?

753
00:31:26,368 --> 00:31:28,502
Talking about the case.

754
00:31:28,504 --> 00:31:30,070
You're just sitting there.

755
00:31:30,072 --> 00:31:32,105
I'm thinking.

756
00:31:32,107 --> 00:31:34,308
I suspect the silence
is exacerbated

757
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,143
by the nature
of our communication.

758
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:37,811
Yes. Well, I don't
live there anymore.

759
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,713
So, if you want
to talk shop at night,

760
00:31:39,715 --> 00:31:41,515
this is the best I can do.

761
00:31:41,517 --> 00:31:45,252
Keep asking myself:
what did the killer want?

762
00:31:45,254 --> 00:31:48,255
He went to great lengths to lure
brilliant mathematicians

763
00:31:48,257 --> 00:31:49,489
to their deaths.

764
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,525
Winnowed out
the less gifted

765
00:31:51,527 --> 00:31:54,061
by making his problems
more and more complicated.

766
00:31:54,063 --> 00:31:57,597
He had a type, but I still think
he's a serial killer

767
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:59,266
only in the most
technical sense.

768
00:31:59,268 --> 00:32:01,201
He tortured both his victims.

769
00:32:01,203 --> 00:32:02,936
But there's no sign
that he enjoyed it.

770
00:32:02,938 --> 00:32:04,538
The work was
utilitarian,

771
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,740
suggesting it was
less for pleasure

772
00:32:06,742 --> 00:32:10,043
and more for persuasion.

773
00:32:10,045 --> 00:32:11,945
He wanted something.

774
00:32:11,947 --> 00:32:13,714
But what?

775
00:32:13,716 --> 00:32:16,483
Maybe there's a connection
between Wallaczek and Lowenthal

776
00:32:16,485 --> 00:32:18,418
we haven't spotted yet.

777
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,220
Maybe they were working
on a project together,

778
00:32:20,222 --> 00:32:21,822
something that was worth
a lot of money.

779
00:32:21,824 --> 00:32:23,857
There's no way the killer
could have predicted

780
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:26,093
which competitors would make it
to the terminal stage.

781
00:32:26,095 --> 00:32:28,795
That part of the game
was beyond his control.

782
00:32:28,797 --> 00:32:30,664
If it weren't,
he would've been prepared

783
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:33,300
to dispose of a body
the size of Ike Wallaczek's.

784
00:32:33,302 --> 00:32:35,335
So, even if there were a
connection between the victims,

785
00:32:35,337 --> 00:32:37,070
the killer could not
have counted on them

786
00:32:37,072 --> 00:32:38,839
being lured into his trap.

787
00:32:38,841 --> 00:32:41,041
Certainly not
in sequence.

788
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:45,112
His game was, in many respects,
one of chance.

789
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:51,718
Suggesting he knows what
he wants, but not who has it.

790
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,888
Like he was on a puzzle hunt
of his own.

791
00:32:56,825 --> 00:32:58,859
I'm back.

792
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:05,665
I'll set up
downstairs, yeah?

793
00:33:09,138 --> 00:33:11,238
I've been thinking about
what you said earlier.

794
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,740
I've decided to engage her
one more time

795
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:15,609
with regards
to her recuperation.

796
00:33:17,112 --> 00:33:21,815
I doubt she'll listen,
but I'll keep you apprised.

797
00:33:25,954 --> 00:33:27,421
I've been thinking.

798
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:29,623
About?
You. Your history.

799
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:31,825
Your decision
not to seek help.

800
00:33:31,827 --> 00:33:34,594
I think it's
a mistake.

801
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,530
Oh?

802
00:33:36,532 --> 00:33:38,198
I've looked into a number
of support groups.

803
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,633
As you are well aware,

804
00:33:39,635 --> 00:33:41,701
I have benefited greatly
from similar settings.

805
00:33:41,703 --> 00:33:43,270
You have.

806
00:33:43,272 --> 00:33:44,638
The process, I find,

807
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,906
is not unlike
voiding one's bowels...

808
00:33:45,908 --> 00:33:47,808
I'll go.
What?

809
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:49,676
I'll go.
Just get me the details.

810
00:33:52,014 --> 00:33:55,182
I've been thinking, too-- about
your number-cruncher, Harlan.

811
00:33:55,184 --> 00:33:57,017
You think I was
too hard on him.

812
00:33:57,019 --> 00:33:58,685
You will have consultants
of your own one day.

813
00:33:58,687 --> 00:34:01,488
You'll see that they require
management and focus.

814
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:04,124
They are but keys on a keyboard,
and we're the typists.

815
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:06,159
You could've given him
a shoeing for all I care.

816
00:34:06,161 --> 00:34:07,828
No, I'm just saying that

817
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:10,030
some of the stuff he's got
up to, it's quite good.

818
00:34:10,032 --> 00:34:11,698
You should take a look.

819
00:34:13,368 --> 00:34:15,735
You may find a fellow typist.

820
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,076
Hello?

821
00:34:23,078 --> 00:34:25,312
Yeah, I
hear that you and some friends

822
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:27,848
are trying to identify
Mo Shellshocker.

823
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,649
That's right. Who is this?

824
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:32,719
His name is Harlan Emple.

825
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:34,020
You got a pen?

826
00:34:34,022 --> 00:34:36,456
I'll-I'll give you his address.

827
00:34:52,454 --> 00:34:54,020
Harlan.

828
00:34:54,022 --> 00:34:56,356
You can't take a hint, can you?

829
00:34:56,358 --> 00:34:57,657
I got your text messages.

830
00:34:57,659 --> 00:34:58,958
I don't want to see you
right now.

831
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,827
So if you came here
to apologize...

832
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:03,363
Actually, I came here
to spare you an agonizing death.

833
00:35:04,299 --> 00:35:05,832
Can I come in?

834
00:35:05,834 --> 00:35:08,301
I was puzzling earlier

835
00:35:08,303 --> 00:35:12,038
as to why the killer went
to such specific lengths.

836
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,606
What did he want?

837
00:35:13,608 --> 00:35:15,809
And then Watson,
quite by accident,

838
00:35:15,811 --> 00:35:17,410
she made a most
compelling analogy.

839
00:35:17,412 --> 00:35:20,080
She said it was as if he
was on a hunt of his own.

840
00:35:20,082 --> 00:35:22,615
Duh. He was hunting
mathematicians.

841
00:35:22,617 --> 00:35:23,783
No, he wasn't.

842
00:35:23,785 --> 00:35:25,151
He was hunting<i> a</i> mathematician.

843
00:35:25,153 --> 00:35:26,619
One.

844
00:35:26,621 --> 00:35:29,389
A man who had concealed
his identity not only

845
00:35:29,391 --> 00:35:31,191
from the mathematics
community at large,

846
00:35:31,193 --> 00:35:32,859
but also from the FBI.

847
00:35:32,861 --> 00:35:35,395
A “crusader,”
you might call him.

848
00:35:35,397 --> 00:35:36,763
Wait a minute.

849
00:35:36,765 --> 00:35:38,731
Are you saying that
this was all about me?

850
00:35:53,448 --> 00:35:56,449
<i> Unfortunately, emulating</i>
<i>the work of people like me</i>

851
00:35:56,451 --> 00:35:59,018
<i>is not without risks.</i>

852
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,320
Creates enemies.

853
00:36:00,322 --> 00:36:02,889
I knew it was the government.

854
00:36:02,891 --> 00:36:04,424
It was a lottery winner.

855
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,260
Little over a year ago,

856
00:36:07,262 --> 00:36:09,529
you started a series of blogs
where you exposed the flaws

857
00:36:09,531 --> 00:36:11,664
in certain scratch card
lottery games.

858
00:36:11,666 --> 00:36:13,766
Tickets like this one.

859
00:36:13,768 --> 00:36:15,802
I wrote about
baited hook games.

860
00:36:15,804 --> 00:36:17,971
Games where the numbers
are printed on the front.

861
00:36:17,973 --> 00:36:20,707
Scratch off the hidden numbers,
hope for a match.

862
00:36:20,709 --> 00:36:23,309
Only, you proved that with
careful mathematical analysis

863
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:25,512
of the visible numbers,
you could predict

864
00:36:25,514 --> 00:36:28,381
which tickets were winners
80% of the time.

865
00:36:28,383 --> 00:36:29,682
If you had exploited

866
00:36:29,684 --> 00:36:32,085
this flaw,
rather than exposing it,

867
00:36:32,087 --> 00:36:33,520
you could have made millions.

868
00:36:33,522 --> 00:36:36,022
Well... sure.
But that would been cheating.

869
00:36:36,024 --> 00:36:37,157
Right.

870
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:38,825
So imagine
for a moment

871
00:36:38,827 --> 00:36:41,060
that you are a less
honest mathematician.

872
00:36:41,062 --> 00:36:42,495
Right?

873
00:36:42,497 --> 00:36:44,063
You've been taking
advantage of these games

874
00:36:44,065 --> 00:36:47,967
for a couple of years to
amass a small fortune.

875
00:36:47,969 --> 00:36:49,502
And then “Mo"
comes along.

876
00:36:49,504 --> 00:36:51,971
He starts exposing
the broken games.

877
00:36:51,973 --> 00:36:54,340
State lottery commissions
shut them down.

878
00:36:54,342 --> 00:36:56,976
The exploitable
games dry up.

879
00:36:56,978 --> 00:37:00,613
Now, if you were a
psychopathic lottery cheat,

880
00:37:00,615 --> 00:37:02,582
how do you fix that?

881
00:37:02,584 --> 00:37:04,484
You kill Mo.

882
00:37:04,486 --> 00:37:07,253
<i>Unfortunately, Mo is elusive.</i>

883
00:37:07,255 --> 00:37:08,821
<i>Anonymous.</i>

884
00:37:08,823 --> 00:37:11,224
The only thing
he knew about him for sure

885
00:37:11,226 --> 00:37:14,394
was that he could not resist
a puzzle hunt.

886
00:37:14,396 --> 00:37:17,130
Now, if you were smart enough
to identify

887
00:37:17,132 --> 00:37:19,399
and take advantage of
broken lottery games...

888
00:37:19,401 --> 00:37:21,868
Then I'm smart enough
to design a puzzle hunt.

889
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:25,338
This plan was not
without its flaws.

890
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:28,775
Once a competitor
reached the terminal stage,

891
00:37:28,777 --> 00:37:32,745
the killer could not be certain
that he'd trapped Mo, could he?

892
00:37:32,747 --> 00:37:34,480
So he tortured them.

893
00:37:34,482 --> 00:37:37,083
I submit he forced them to
log on to Mo's Web site,

894
00:37:37,085 --> 00:37:39,686
and when they failed...

895
00:37:41,323 --> 00:37:42,755
After two murders,

896
00:37:42,757 --> 00:37:44,290
the game was compromised.

897
00:37:44,292 --> 00:37:46,192
So the killer devises
a Plan “B.”

898
00:37:46,194 --> 00:37:47,460
He tricks

899
00:37:47,462 --> 00:37:49,229
a group of his peers

900
00:37:49,231 --> 00:37:51,097
into helping search
for an alternative means

901
00:37:51,099 --> 00:37:53,032
of identifying Mo.

902
00:37:56,504 --> 00:37:58,438
You're talking about that guy.

903
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,906
The one with the penthouse.

904
00:37:59,908 --> 00:38:02,742
<i>Paul?</i>

905
00:38:02,744 --> 00:38:05,044
Lottery winners
are public record.

906
00:38:05,046 --> 00:38:07,814
So when I searched for
the names of repeat winners

907
00:38:07,816 --> 00:38:09,482
in the dates prior
to your posts...

908
00:38:09,484 --> 00:38:11,317
I can't believe
I drank his water.

909
00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:12,685
I called him.

910
00:38:12,687 --> 00:38:14,654
I identified you as Mo.

911
00:38:14,656 --> 00:38:16,122
And I gave him your address.

912
00:38:16,124 --> 00:38:17,590
You what?!

913
00:38:21,129 --> 00:38:23,062
Drop your weapon!

914
00:38:23,064 --> 00:38:24,597
<i>I did not, however, give him</i>

915
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:25,965
<i>the correct apartment number.</i>

916
00:38:25,967 --> 00:38:28,334
He was arrested
a little over an hour ago.

917
00:38:30,739 --> 00:38:31,871
Tried to call you to
tell you, but, um...

918
00:38:31,873 --> 00:38:33,539
But I was ignoring you.

919
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:35,008
Yes, you were ignoring me.

920
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,209
Look, you know

921
00:38:36,211 --> 00:38:37,377
that I'm still screwed, right?

922
00:38:37,379 --> 00:38:39,279
You told him that I'm Mo.

923
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:42,115
He's gonna tell the police,
they're gonna tell the FBI...

924
00:38:42,117 --> 00:38:43,516
The NYPD is under
the impression

925
00:38:43,518 --> 00:38:45,385
that I lied about
your connection to Mo

926
00:38:45,387 --> 00:38:47,920
in order to draw
Mr. Ettinger out.

927
00:38:47,922 --> 00:38:49,555
As far as the
FBI goes, well,

928
00:38:49,557 --> 00:38:51,958
I've got some associates
who have created a trail

929
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,860
which will
strongly suggest that Mo

930
00:38:53,862 --> 00:38:55,728
is a cyber-terrorist
I became aware of

931
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:58,197
whilst working for, um...

932
00:38:58,199 --> 00:38:59,766
queen and country.

933
00:38:59,768 --> 00:39:02,135
Your secret's
quite safe.

934
00:39:02,137 --> 00:39:03,903
Thanks.

935
00:39:06,508 --> 00:39:09,776
My reasons for preserving you
are entirely selfish, Harlan.

936
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:13,279
You are a tremendous asset.

937
00:39:13,281 --> 00:39:15,815
I have little doubt

938
00:39:15,817 --> 00:39:19,118
I will need your help again
in the future.

939
00:39:26,461 --> 00:39:28,528
Me or him?

940
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:29,996
You.

941
00:39:29,998 --> 00:39:31,798
I have an update on
that real estate flipper.

942
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,433
I thought you might
want to know.

943
00:39:39,274 --> 00:39:41,908
I tracked down the truck rental
receipts to get her name.

944
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,142
Valerie Cork.

945
00:39:43,144 --> 00:39:44,911
She's an art authenticator.

946
00:39:44,913 --> 00:39:46,779
And that crate you saw?

947
00:39:46,781 --> 00:39:48,414
There was
something called

948
00:39:48,416 --> 00:39:50,683
a scanning fluorescence
spectrometry machine inside.

949
00:39:50,685 --> 00:39:52,251
They're used...
To find paintings

950
00:39:52,253 --> 00:39:53,553
underneath other paintings.

951
00:39:53,555 --> 00:39:55,288
So it turns out
that the building

952
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:56,689
Chad Keswick was looking to buy

953
00:39:56,691 --> 00:39:59,025
was leased by the WPA
during the Depression.

954
00:39:59,027 --> 00:40:00,927
They commissioned a
mural for the lobby.

955
00:40:00,929 --> 00:40:03,329
The artist was a
notorious communist,

956
00:40:03,331 --> 00:40:05,365
so when the property passed
into private hands in the '50s,

957
00:40:05,367 --> 00:40:06,999
the new owners
had it painted over.

958
00:40:07,001 --> 00:40:08,735
But it was still there,
under the paint.

959
00:40:08,737 --> 00:40:11,037
A lost work by Diego Rivera.

960
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:13,473
It's worth ten times
the price of the building.

961
00:40:14,676 --> 00:40:17,043
I was hoping to leak
the truth to the<i> Times.</i>

962
00:40:18,113 --> 00:40:20,046
I promised you a cut of my fee.

963
00:40:20,048 --> 00:40:22,148
But I'm pretty sure
the mural's gonna end up

964
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:24,384
in the hands of
a historical trust.

965
00:40:24,386 --> 00:40:26,352
I'd feel obligated
to refund my client,

966
00:40:26,354 --> 00:40:28,388
which means you'd get
a cut of nothing.

967
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:31,457
That works for me.

968
00:40:31,459 --> 00:40:33,493
Okay.

969
00:40:35,463 --> 00:40:37,397
I think you should know

970
00:40:37,399 --> 00:40:39,732
that I am going
to a meeting tonight.

971
00:40:41,803 --> 00:40:45,505
One of those
support groups for...

972
00:40:45,507 --> 00:40:47,340
people like me.

973
00:40:47,342 --> 00:40:49,876
It was, uh, Sherlock's idea.

974
00:40:49,878 --> 00:40:51,644
That's great.

975
00:40:51,646 --> 00:40:53,446
I know you put him up to it.

976
00:40:53,448 --> 00:40:55,381
We talked.

977
00:40:57,552 --> 00:41:00,219
When he first approached me
in London,

978
00:41:00,221 --> 00:41:03,556
I was...

979
00:41:03,558 --> 00:41:05,558
in a bad way.

980
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,227
And I had been for a while.

981
00:41:08,229 --> 00:41:11,130
But then,
when he talked about

982
00:41:11,132 --> 00:41:12,365
the work that he did,

983
00:41:12,367 --> 00:41:16,035
about the things
that he saw in me...

984
00:41:18,406 --> 00:41:19,739
I want it.

985
00:41:19,741 --> 00:41:21,874
I want every bit
of what's he offered me,

986
00:41:21,876 --> 00:41:23,843
of what he offered you, but...

987
00:41:23,845 --> 00:41:26,212
if I've learned one thing
over the last few weeks,

988
00:41:26,214 --> 00:41:28,047
it's that he can't pull it off.

989
00:41:28,049 --> 00:41:29,682
Not by himself, anyway.

990
00:41:31,586 --> 00:41:34,153
And if I'm gonna get
what I want,

991
00:41:34,155 --> 00:41:37,690
then I'm going to need
your help, too.

992
00:41:40,361 --> 00:41:42,829
I still think
the meetings are bollocks,

993
00:41:42,831 --> 00:41:44,931
but you say they're important.

994
00:41:44,933 --> 00:41:47,967
They matter to you, so...

995
00:41:47,969 --> 00:41:49,735
What do you say, Watson?

996
00:41:49,737 --> 00:41:52,071
Will you help me?

997
00:41:56,277 --> 00:41:58,244
I don't know how it happened.

998
00:41:58,246 --> 00:42:01,547
It just... hit me.

999
00:42:01,549 --> 00:42:03,983
Like a truck, out of nowhere.

1000
00:42:04,853 --> 00:42:07,753
Work is good.

1001
00:42:07,755 --> 00:42:09,755
I have friends.

1002
00:42:09,757 --> 00:42:13,092
I'm in a
relationship.

1003
00:42:13,094 --> 00:42:16,896
Somewhere along
the way, somehow,

1004
00:42:16,898 --> 00:42:19,732
I stopped being a victim

1005
00:42:19,734 --> 00:42:22,602
and became a survivor.

1006
00:42:22,604 --> 00:42:25,705
So, I guess all I'm saying is,
there's hope.

1007
00:42:26,357 --> 00:42:31,686
Do the work. Love yourself.
There's hope.

2
00:00:03,422 --> 00:00:04,761
If you're looking for Sherlock,
he's downstairs.

3
00:00:04,785 --> 00:00:05,841
Okay.

4
00:00:05,842 --> 00:00:07,541
<i>His name is Harlan Emple.</i>

00:00:07,543 --> 00:00:09,176
<i>He is the Rachel P. Hanson</i>
<i>Professor</i>

6

for Applied Mathematics
at Columbia University.

7
00:00:11,301 --> 00:00:14,502
What I don't get is
why he isn't wearing a shirt.

8
00:00:14,504 --> 00:00:17,372
He doesn't like anything to come
between him and the numbers.

9
00:00:17,374 --> 00:00:18,415
What is it?

10
00:00:18,438 --> 00:00:20,274
The answers to your questions
about Kitty.

11
00:00:20,276 --> 00:00:22,710
The truth is she was a
victim of a horrific crime.

12
00:00:22,712 --> 00:00:24,646
<i>After you left last night,</i>

13
00:00:24,648 --> 00:00:26,848
Sherlock gave me an envelope.

14
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,249
Sherlock keeps saying

15
00:00:28,251 --> 00:00:30,385
that I need to get
a better sense of you,

16
00:00:30,387 --> 00:00:33,021
and maybe that will give you
a better sense of me.

17
00:00:42,065 --> 00:00:43,065
It's open.

18
00:00:47,637 --> 00:00:49,003
It's nothing.

19
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:50,872
It's Sherlock and
one of his experts.

20
00:00:50,874 --> 00:00:52,006
Which one?

21
00:00:52,008 --> 00:00:53,241
Phillip something.

22
00:00:53,243 --> 00:00:54,575
Must be new.

23
00:00:54,577 --> 00:00:57,445
He's a knife-thrower.

24
00:00:57,447 --> 00:00:58,913
Why does Sherlock have
a knife-thrower?

25
00:00:58,915 --> 00:01:00,748
He got bored the other day,

26
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,185
started looking into this, uh,
circus accident from the '30s.

27
00:01:04,187 --> 00:01:07,922
The Great Galardo perforated one
of his assistants during an act,

28
00:01:07,924 --> 00:01:09,924
except Sherlock thinks
the blade was thrown

29
00:01:09,926 --> 00:01:11,492
by somebody in the stands,
not Galardo.

30
00:01:11,494 --> 00:01:15,096
Phillip, as far as I
can tell, disagrees.

31
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:18,900
It can't be done, okay?

32
00:01:18,902 --> 00:01:19,934
It was done.

33
00:01:19,936 --> 00:01:21,335
You're wrong.

34
00:01:21,337 --> 00:01:23,538
Nobody can chuck
a knife that far.

35
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,239
What's this?

36
00:01:25,241 --> 00:01:26,207
You're...

37
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:27,209
Not here.

38
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,509
I'm not here.

39
00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:29,711
Remember that, okay?

40
00:01:29,713 --> 00:01:31,279
Oh, yes. Heaven
forfend your work

41
00:01:31,281 --> 00:01:33,247
with me should endanger
your precious day job.

42
00:01:33,249 --> 00:01:35,116
You throw knives?

43
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,252
You know, it was supposed
to be just you here.

44
00:01:38,254 --> 00:01:41,355
Phillip is arguably the greatest
knife-thrower in the world.

45
00:01:41,357 --> 00:01:42,790
Has been for decades.

46
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:43,925
Only, there's little money

47
00:01:43,927 --> 00:01:45,193
to be made
in the impalement arts.

48
00:01:45,195 --> 00:01:46,494
So, as a youth, he turned

49
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,563
to what you Americans
term “football”"

50
00:01:48,565 --> 00:01:50,131
Is this a joke?

51
00:01:53,837 --> 00:01:55,002
Phillip, head
and heart.

52
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:56,904
Come on.
Head and heart.

53
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:06,814
Can I go?

54
00:02:06,816 --> 00:02:09,484
Yeah.

55
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,489
15 years he spent throwing
that misshapen ball around.

56
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:16,057
15 years.

57
00:02:16,059 --> 00:02:18,259
When I think of the acclaim
he could have brought

58
00:02:18,261 --> 00:02:20,828
to competitive blade slinging.

59
00:02:27,237 --> 00:02:29,036
You're following me,
Watson.

60
00:02:29,038 --> 00:02:30,338
I don't like it.

61
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,740
I want you to help
me with something.

62
00:02:32,742 --> 00:02:33,908
This is Chad Keswick.

63
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,976
He buys distressed
buildings,

64
00:02:34,978 --> 00:02:36,210
paints, spackles,

65
00:02:36,212 --> 00:02:37,645
and then flips them
for quick money.

66
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:39,180
Who'd he kill?
No one.

67
00:02:39,182 --> 00:02:41,315
I was hired by one of
his rivals to find out

68
00:02:41,317 --> 00:02:43,017
why he's been circling
this old office building

69
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:44,218
in Jamaica, Queens.

70
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,586
She wants to know
why he thinks

71
00:02:45,588 --> 00:02:47,355
the building is
a good investment.

72
00:02:47,357 --> 00:02:49,590
Is there a crime in there,
something worth investigating?

73
00:02:49,592 --> 00:02:50,925
Well, I've been
shadowing Keswick,

74
00:02:50,927 --> 00:02:52,593
but yesterday I think
he noticed me.

75
00:02:52,595 --> 00:02:54,595
I want to switch
up the tail.

76
00:02:54,597 --> 00:02:57,231
You followed me for over
a week before I noticed you.

77
00:02:57,233 --> 00:02:59,033
Help me out, and I'll
cut you in on my fee.

78
00:02:59,035 --> 00:03:02,003
I don't work for you,
I work for Sherlock.

79
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:03,437
I worked for him, too.

80
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,773
And, in my experience,
he was always supportive

81
00:03:05,775 --> 00:03:07,942
of taking on work
outside the partnership.

82
00:03:07,944 --> 00:03:10,912
Sorry, it's not my cup of tea.

83
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:33,034
Hello, Portal Ten.

84
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,247
I'm here, Belphegor.

85
00:03:46,249 --> 00:03:49,784
So where is the next clue?

Yeah, you called it
a puzzle hunt.

91
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,491
Belphegor's Prime.

92
00:04:50,761 --> 00:04:53,262
Think Cicada 3301
or Octorine's Challenge.

93
00:04:54,365 --> 00:04:55,631
They're math games.

94
00:04:55,633 --> 00:04:56,865
Math-- maybe you've heard of it.

95
00:04:56,867 --> 00:04:58,333
I've got some math for you.

96
00:04:58,335 --> 00:05:00,335
One dead guy
plus one live guy

97
00:05:00,337 --> 00:05:02,104
found in the same
deserted factory.

98
00:05:02,106 --> 00:05:06,108
I was not “found” there;
I am the one who called 911.

99
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,310
I was waiting there
for the police.

100
00:05:08,312 --> 00:05:09,745
Mr. Emple,

101
00:05:09,747 --> 00:05:11,613
we're just trying
to do our jobs, all right?

102
00:05:11,615 --> 00:05:13,048
First officers
on the scene described you

103
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,516
as “extremely agitated.”

104
00:05:14,518 --> 00:05:15,984
Well, of course
I was agitated.

105
00:05:15,986 --> 00:05:18,754
I had just found
a dead guy in mothballs!

106
00:05:18,756 --> 00:05:21,790
And did I mention that I have
not slept in almost two days?

107
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:23,358
Because of the math game.

108
00:05:24,762 --> 00:05:26,195
Can I borrow those?

109
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:31,100
This...

110
00:05:31,102 --> 00:05:33,302
is Belphegor's Prime, okay?

111
00:05:33,304 --> 00:05:35,304
It's a numeric palindrome.

112
00:05:35,306 --> 00:05:40,776
It's 666 bookended by 13 zeroes
and then bracketed with ones.

113
00:05:40,778 --> 00:05:43,846
Named for the demon Belphegor
who was a prince of hell.

114
00:05:43,848 --> 00:05:46,448
The first clue for the hunt
started making the rounds

115
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,883
a few months ago.

116
00:05:47,885 --> 00:05:49,651
It was a JPEG with two numbers
hidden in it.

117
00:05:49,653 --> 00:05:51,453
You divide those numbers
by Belphegor's Prime,

118
00:05:51,455 --> 00:05:54,890
and you get the GPS coordinates
for a restroom at the Bronx Zoo.

119
00:05:54,892 --> 00:05:56,959
You go to the restroom,
you find a phone number.

120
00:05:56,961 --> 00:05:58,927
You send a text to the number,
you get the next clue.

121
00:05:58,929 --> 00:05:59,962
Which is another math problem.

122
00:05:59,964 --> 00:06:00,929
Exactly.

123
00:06:00,931 --> 00:06:02,397
Only, this one is harder.

124
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,099
And that's how it works.

125
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:05,934
You know, but for
each one that you solve,

126
00:06:05,936 --> 00:06:08,103
you get a new set
of GPS coordinates.

127
00:06:08,105 --> 00:06:11,473
And that means that you've
completed a stage, or a portal.

128
00:06:11,475 --> 00:06:13,509
And last night,
I was on Portal Ten.

129
00:06:13,511 --> 00:06:15,711
And...

130
00:06:17,014 --> 00:06:18,313
You know what?

131
00:06:18,315 --> 00:06:20,015
I want to talk
to Sherlock and Joan.

132
00:06:20,017 --> 00:06:21,917
Look, Mr. Emple...
No, I'm sorry.

133
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,019
I told the police down
at the factory that I know them.

134
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:25,287
Isn't that the whole reason

135
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:26,922
that I was brought here
to this squad?

136
00:06:26,924 --> 00:06:30,392
I-I am not saying another word
until they are here.

137
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:35,264
Harlan Emple is
indeed an acquaintance.

138
00:06:35,266 --> 00:06:37,733
He is, in point of fact,
one of my “irregulars.”

139
00:06:37,735 --> 00:06:38,801
One of your what?

140
00:06:38,803 --> 00:06:40,302
Irregulars.

141
00:06:40,304 --> 00:06:41,770
I'm your consultant, Captain;
they are mine.

142
00:06:41,772 --> 00:06:43,572
They're a handful
of experts I turn to

143
00:06:43,574 --> 00:06:46,108
when I encounter problems which
are beyond my pool of knowledge.

144
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,810
Harlan is
a brilliant mathematician.

145
00:06:47,812 --> 00:06:49,778
And on the handful of occasions
I have tackled a case

146
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,046
which pertained
to mathematics...

147
00:06:51,048 --> 00:06:53,182
He helped you out.
Well, the good news

148
00:06:53,184 --> 00:06:56,018
for him is the preliminary
autopsy report just came in

149
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,252
before you got here.

150
00:06:57,254 --> 00:06:59,021
And the M.E. puts
the time of death

151
00:06:59,023 --> 00:07:00,989
between 4:00 and
6:00 p.m. last night.

152
00:07:00,991 --> 00:07:02,124
Mr. Emple was teaching

153
00:07:02,126 --> 00:07:03,358
a class at Columbia.

154
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,394
So the victim is
yet to be identified?

155
00:07:05,396 --> 00:07:07,663
No I.D., no phone.

156
00:07:07,665 --> 00:07:09,865
First detective on the scene
liked it for a mob hit,

157
00:07:09,867 --> 00:07:11,500
so while we're
running the prints,

158
00:07:11,502 --> 00:07:13,602
he's showing the vic's
face around OCID.

159
00:07:13,604 --> 00:07:16,839
Marcus here was about to walk
the scene with Mr. Emple.

160
00:07:16,841 --> 00:07:18,774
You're here now;
you might as well tag along.

161
00:07:18,776 --> 00:07:21,009
Actually, Captain,
I'm quite busy today.

162
00:07:21,011 --> 00:07:22,978
This is a John Doe,
and we got nothing.

163
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,247
And, like you just said,
you're my consultant.

164
00:07:25,249 --> 00:07:26,748
So, go consult.

165
00:07:29,787 --> 00:07:30,986
Watson.

166
00:07:30,988 --> 00:07:32,588
Um, he's your friend.

167
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,523
Actually, Kitty is
otherwise engaged,

168
00:07:34,525 --> 00:07:37,426
and he did actually help both
of us with a case last year.

169
00:07:37,428 --> 00:07:38,493
Did he not?

170
00:07:40,865 --> 00:07:44,099
Have I told you
how good it is to see you?

171
00:07:44,101 --> 00:07:45,367
Yes, you have.
Three times.

172
00:07:45,369 --> 00:07:46,468
Well, it is.

173
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,636
Hey, lousy circumstances.

174
00:07:47,638 --> 00:07:49,371
But, uh, hey...

175
00:07:49,373 --> 00:07:51,740
I heard from your boss that you
just, uh, got back from London.

176
00:07:51,742 --> 00:07:53,308
Were you working
a case or...?

177
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,576
No, I moved back there.

178
00:07:54,578 --> 00:07:55,677
You mean<i> moved,</i> moved?

179
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:56,845
Is there another
definition?

180
00:07:56,847 --> 00:07:58,513
I was there for
eight months,

181
00:07:58,515 --> 00:08:00,883
and had a change of heart
and returned to New York.

182
00:08:00,885 --> 00:08:02,517
So, you moved to London,
and you didn't, uh...

183
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,086
You know what?
Doesn't even matter.

184
00:08:04,088 --> 00:08:05,387
The point is you're back!

185
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:07,389
Mr. Emple.
Uh, duty calls.

186
00:08:07,391 --> 00:08:09,024
Yeah.

187
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:18,634
It's interesting.

188
00:08:18,636 --> 00:08:20,068
Mothballs are interesting?

189
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,070
They were taken from
that cabinet over there.

190
00:08:22,072 --> 00:08:25,941
Obviously, to cover the smell
of John Doe's decay.

191
00:08:25,943 --> 00:08:28,043
The killer didn't
bring them with him.

192
00:08:28,045 --> 00:08:31,179
Perhaps leaving the body here
was not part of his plan, hmm?

193
00:08:32,983 --> 00:08:36,018
Doe was shot in the foot
first and then the knee.

194
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,453
Either those were
two really bad misses or...

195
00:08:38,455 --> 00:08:41,256
Or the killer was torturing him.

196
00:08:41,258 --> 00:08:43,892
This doesn't seem like anything
you can't handle on your own.

197
00:08:43,894 --> 00:08:45,994
So you want to tell me why you
really asked me to come here?

198
00:08:45,996 --> 00:08:48,363
“This doesn't seem like anything
you can't handle on your own.”

199
00:08:48,365 --> 00:08:49,765
That's funny.

200
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:51,566
That's exactly what
I would have said

201
00:08:51,568 --> 00:08:53,602
had I been present when you
asked Kitty for her assistance

202
00:08:53,604 --> 00:08:54,937
with your tawdry side job.

203
00:08:54,939 --> 00:08:57,372
“Tawdry”?
I wanted you to know I approve.

204
00:08:57,374 --> 00:08:59,007
Of what?

205
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:01,376
Your agenda
with regards to Kitty.

206
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:03,078
Several days ago,
I gave you her file.

207
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,913
And then you show up at
the brownstone yesterday,

208
00:09:04,915 --> 00:09:06,515
and you invite her
into an investigation.

209
00:09:06,517 --> 00:09:08,183
Coincidence? No, I think not.

210
00:09:08,185 --> 00:09:11,320
You feel for her.
And now you wish to engage.

211
00:09:11,322 --> 00:09:13,956
It's not an outcome
I would have predicted, no.

212
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,458
But it is one
I approve of, yeah.

213
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,193
She could learn
a great deal from you,

214
00:09:18,195 --> 00:09:20,228
especially with regards
to how to get the most

215
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,864
from my tutelage.

216
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:25,734
So, I've already dispatched her
to, uh, follow your Mr. Keswick.

217
00:09:25,736 --> 00:09:27,836
But that's not
what I actually...

218
00:09:27,838 --> 00:09:29,404
Harlan!

219
00:09:30,741 --> 00:09:33,075
You came here to retrieve
a phone number, did you not?

220
00:09:33,077 --> 00:09:34,609
You would send a text,
and then receive

221
00:09:34,611 --> 00:09:36,845
the next clue in the game
that you were playing.

222
00:09:36,847 --> 00:09:38,747
Yeah, but I didn't find it.

223
00:09:38,749 --> 00:09:40,048
Not that I kept looking

224
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,250
after the dead guy
fell out of the locker.

225
00:09:42,252 --> 00:09:44,052
Yeah, CSU didn't find
any number either.

226
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:46,154
Probably because
it's under that paint.

227
00:09:46,156 --> 00:09:48,190
It's fresh.

228
00:09:48,192 --> 00:09:49,891
Applied in the last

229
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:52,694
24 hours.

230
00:09:52,696 --> 00:09:54,696
Right after John Doe's murder,
I'd wager.

231
00:09:54,698 --> 00:09:57,099
You don't think
this was a mob hit?

232
00:09:57,101 --> 00:09:59,101
Doe and the killer were
playing the game, too.

233
00:09:59,103 --> 00:10:01,203
The killer shot Doe and
then covered up the number

234
00:10:01,205 --> 00:10:02,704
so no one else could use it.

235
00:10:02,706 --> 00:10:04,806
What's the prize
in your little contest?

236
00:10:04,808 --> 00:10:07,576
Well, I'm doing it
mostly for the math.

237
00:10:07,578 --> 00:10:11,480
But, uh, $1,707,071.

238
00:10:11,482 --> 00:10:13,882
It's another
palindromic prime.

239
00:10:13,884 --> 00:10:17,152
Did I not mention the
money at the station?

240
00:10:17,154 --> 00:10:18,587
Who the hell can afford

241
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:20,655
that kind of payout
for a puzzle hunt?

242
00:10:20,657 --> 00:10:22,124
Well, most people
think it's CAML.

243
00:10:22,126 --> 00:10:24,593
The Center for Applied
Mathematics and Logic.

244
00:10:24,595 --> 00:10:26,094
It's located
in Ramapo...

245
00:10:26,096 --> 00:10:27,729
Wait, most people
“think” it's them?

246
00:10:27,731 --> 00:10:29,331
Well, hunts like these,

247
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,266
the organizers are
almost always anonymous.

248
00:10:31,268 --> 00:10:32,401
It's S.O.P.

249
00:10:32,403 --> 00:10:34,302
What about the
contestants?

250
00:10:34,304 --> 00:10:37,005
Is anonymity
also S.O.P.?

251
00:10:37,007 --> 00:10:39,207
For the most part, yeah.

252
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:43,078
But, guys, math peeps
are my peeps, okay?

253
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,314
It's, uh, like
a community, sort of.

254
00:10:46,316 --> 00:10:48,984
I can think of ten
or 12 other people

255
00:10:48,986 --> 00:10:50,018
who were probably competing.

256
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,186
Would that help?

257
00:10:53,157 --> 00:10:55,223
No.

258
00:10:55,225 --> 00:10:58,026
I'm sorry, I don't know him.

259
00:10:58,028 --> 00:11:00,862
But you admit you were
competing in Belphegor's Prime.

260
00:11:00,864 --> 00:11:02,197
I do.

261
00:11:04,835 --> 00:11:05,934
Pepe!

262
00:11:08,172 --> 00:11:10,439
Sorry. He doesn't
like strangers.

263
00:11:12,109 --> 00:11:14,443
Give him one of these.

264
00:11:14,445 --> 00:11:16,111
Get on his good side.

265
00:11:24,288 --> 00:11:26,354
What are you doing?

266
00:11:28,225 --> 00:11:30,725
I'm just verifying that
you've been lying to us.

267
00:11:30,727 --> 00:11:33,895
You did know the
dead man, did you not?

268
00:11:33,897 --> 00:11:36,998
I reviewed his personal
effects at the morgue earlier.

269
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,034
The coroner reported finding
crumbs in one of his pockets.

270
00:11:39,036 --> 00:11:40,036
I tasted one.

271
00:11:40,037 --> 00:11:41,269
Why would you...?

272
00:11:41,271 --> 00:11:42,771
At first, I thought
they were from

273
00:11:42,773 --> 00:11:44,439
a particularly rancid
brand of cheese,

274
00:11:44,441 --> 00:11:47,609
but, no... they're from
one of Pepe's treats.

275
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:49,277
Homemade?

276
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,481
Harlan was able to give us
the names of nine other people

277
00:11:52,483 --> 00:11:54,149
he believed to be
other competitors.

278
00:11:54,151 --> 00:11:55,984
Our colleagues are
investigating them as we speak,

279
00:11:55,986 --> 00:11:57,919
but I'll quite happily
recommend that the NYPD

280
00:11:57,921 --> 00:12:00,222
focus its attention
entirely on you.

281
00:12:04,128 --> 00:12:06,428
His name was Ike Walaczek.

282
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,231
In another lifetime,
he was my boyfriend.

283
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:10,866
And what of
this lifetime?

284
00:12:10,868 --> 00:12:12,701
We were working together.

285
00:12:12,703 --> 00:12:14,769
On Belphegor's.
What?!

286
00:12:14,771 --> 00:12:16,705
He was a numerical analyst
at the Tory Foundation.

287
00:12:16,707 --> 00:12:17,873
I work mostly in combinatorics.

288
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,307
I thought we would make
a good team.

289
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:20,742
But there aren't
supposed to be teams.

290
00:12:20,744 --> 00:12:22,711
Not in a puzzle hunt.
It's bad form.

291
00:12:22,713 --> 00:12:23,713
Harlan...

292
00:12:23,714 --> 00:12:25,514
I'm just saying...

293
00:12:25,516 --> 00:12:27,315
My husband
wouldn't understand,

294
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:30,385
so I decided I wouldn't tell him
until after we won the money.

295
00:12:30,387 --> 00:12:33,121
A team-- so that's how
you got there before me.

296
00:12:33,123 --> 00:12:34,489
I wasn't there.

297
00:12:34,491 --> 00:12:36,258
Tom and I were out of town
until this morning.

298
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,126
His cousin
was getting married in Hawaii.

299
00:12:38,128 --> 00:12:40,662
That's why Ike went
to the coordinates by himself.

300
00:12:40,664 --> 00:12:42,097
Because I couldn't.

301
00:12:44,268 --> 00:12:46,601
These are pictures I took.

302
00:12:46,603 --> 00:12:49,337
Check the dates.

303
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:51,506
You gave the police
nine other names?

304
00:12:51,508 --> 00:12:53,408
People you thought
were competing?

305
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,776
I've got 16.

306
00:12:54,778 --> 00:12:56,311
And I know they were competing.

307
00:12:58,448 --> 00:13:01,249
He talked to her
outside the Jamaica property

308
00:13:01,251 --> 00:13:05,720
for about 20 minutes,
and then this truck rolled up.

309
00:13:05,722 --> 00:13:07,822
Any idea what's
inside the crate?

310
00:13:07,824 --> 00:13:09,024
Nope.

311
00:13:09,026 --> 00:13:10,392
I can't identify
the woman either.

312
00:13:10,394 --> 00:13:12,260
Everything about her
said money though.

313
00:13:12,262 --> 00:13:15,363
She, Keswick
and the mystery box

314
00:13:15,365 --> 00:13:17,732
stayed inside the building
for about three hours,

315
00:13:17,734 --> 00:13:20,001
and then off they went.

316
00:13:20,904 --> 00:13:22,170
Good.

317
00:13:22,172 --> 00:13:23,872
Okay.

318
00:13:23,874 --> 00:13:26,074
You know where
to send the check.

319
00:13:26,076 --> 00:13:30,145
You haven't asked me about
the file Sherlock gave me.

320
00:13:30,147 --> 00:13:32,080
Why would I?

321
00:13:32,082 --> 00:13:36,184
You said it would give me
a better sense of you-- it did.

322
00:13:37,588 --> 00:13:40,155
That's why you asked
for my help.

323
00:13:40,157 --> 00:13:41,990
Because you felt sorry for me.

324
00:13:41,992 --> 00:13:44,226
No.

325
00:13:44,228 --> 00:13:46,194
You just don't seem interested
in anything

326
00:13:46,196 --> 00:13:48,063
outside of becoming
a detective.

327
00:13:48,065 --> 00:13:50,999
There she is.

328
00:13:51,001 --> 00:13:53,301
The old counselor.

329
00:13:53,303 --> 00:13:55,637
Who used to hold
Sherlock's hand.

330
00:13:57,608 --> 00:13:59,741
Everything that you read,

331
00:13:59,743 --> 00:14:02,510
everything that happened to me,
that's all it is.

332
00:14:02,512 --> 00:14:04,646
It's just something
that happened.

333
00:14:04,648 --> 00:14:08,116
And it's all
in the past now.

334
00:14:08,118 --> 00:14:10,685
So let's just
leave it there, shall we?

335
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:24,667
Hello.

336
00:14:24,668 --> 00:14:26,001
You've had sex.

337
00:14:26,003 --> 00:14:27,202
Excuse me?

338
00:14:27,204 --> 00:14:28,503
I can hear it
in your voice.

339
00:14:28,505 --> 00:14:29,771
You've joined paunches.

340
00:14:29,773 --> 00:14:30,972
Good for you, Watson.

341
00:14:30,974 --> 00:14:32,807
As you know, I think
the act of love

342
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:34,676
can be quite conducive to...
What do you want?

343
00:14:34,678 --> 00:14:36,911
Merely to apprise you
of a new development

344
00:14:36,913 --> 00:14:38,280
in the murder of
Ike Walaczek.

345
00:14:38,282 --> 00:14:40,115
As I informed
you yesterday,

346
00:14:40,117 --> 00:14:42,284
Harlan and I were given
a new list of competitors.

347
00:14:42,286 --> 00:14:45,320
One name leapt out:
Byron Lowenthal.

348
00:14:45,322 --> 00:14:48,156
He's a statistician at the
Public Utilities Commission

349
00:14:48,158 --> 00:14:50,425
and a diagnosed
paranoid schizophrenic.

350
00:14:50,427 --> 00:14:52,160
He's been hospitalized
for becoming violent

351
00:14:52,162 --> 00:14:53,728
on no fewer
than three occasions.

352
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,964
Certainly sounds like
it could be our guy.

353
00:14:55,966 --> 00:14:59,367
Unfortunately, Mr. Lowenthal had
another break earlier this year.

354
00:14:59,369 --> 00:15:02,137
He's been staying in
a transient hotel ever since.

355
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:04,239
Detective Bell and I
are going to speak with him.

356
00:15:04,241 --> 00:15:05,307
You want me to meet you?

357
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:06,875
Oh, no, we're already here.

358
00:15:06,877 --> 00:15:08,410
Anyway, now that I know
that you've enjoyed coitus

359
00:15:08,412 --> 00:15:09,778
and could enjoy more
in the near future...

360
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,846
When you're done,
we need to talk.

361
00:15:14,718 --> 00:15:16,818
Byron Lowenthal,
you in there?

362
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,053
Who is it?

363
00:15:18,055 --> 00:15:19,754
It's Detective Bell, NYPD.

364
00:15:19,756 --> 00:15:22,257
My colleague and I would like
to ask you some questions.

365
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:24,592
Let me
get some pants on.

366
00:15:37,341 --> 00:15:40,008
S-Sorry, I just... I, um...

367
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,310
I-I thought I heard
Mr. Lowenthal retr...

368
00:16:19,154 --> 00:16:21,267
You guys got lucky.

369
00:16:21,268 --> 00:16:22,868
Well, luck had little
to do with it, actually.

370
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,536
I... I heard Mr. Lowenthal

371
00:16:24,538 --> 00:16:27,039
pulling a heavy object off
a shelf, placing it on his bed,

372
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,041
and the sound of
the zipper indicated

373
00:16:29,043 --> 00:16:30,976
that it was
a large gun case.

374
00:16:30,978 --> 00:16:33,579
Looks like he was sane enough
to do math, but not much else.

375
00:16:33,581 --> 00:16:34,747
Plus, he was
pretty hopped up.

376
00:16:34,749 --> 00:16:36,448
Caffeine pills,
energy drinks,

377
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,251
pretty much every legal
stimulant you can buy.

378
00:16:39,253 --> 00:16:40,853
Plus a few illegal ones.

379
00:16:40,855 --> 00:16:42,821
Hmm. Obviously, he was
keeping himself awake

380
00:16:42,823 --> 00:16:44,490
so he could work on
Belphegor's.

381
00:16:44,492 --> 00:16:47,392
This... is obvious to you?

382
00:16:47,394 --> 00:16:48,961
I confess the maths
are beyond me,

383
00:16:48,963 --> 00:16:51,130
but I took the liberty of
sending pictures of what

384
00:16:51,132 --> 00:16:52,865
appear to be Mr. Lowenthal's
most recent scribbles

385
00:16:52,867 --> 00:16:54,166
to Harlan Emple,
and he's confirmed

386
00:16:54,168 --> 00:16:55,667
they are part of the contest.

387
00:16:55,669 --> 00:16:56,969
With your permission,
I'd like copies of these

388
00:16:56,971 --> 00:16:58,837
sent to my home
so he can review them.

389
00:16:58,839 --> 00:16:59,972
What for?

390
00:16:59,974 --> 00:17:01,073
If Byron Lowenthal

391
00:17:01,075 --> 00:17:02,441
did kill Ike Walaczek,

392
00:17:02,443 --> 00:17:04,109
then he used
and obscured a phone number,

393
00:17:04,111 --> 00:17:05,878
which would have yielded
the next problem.

394
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,379
That problem's solution

395
00:17:07,381 --> 00:17:08,714
would be GPS coordinates.

396
00:17:08,716 --> 00:17:10,415
If he's recorded them
in his books...

397
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:12,551
Your pal will be able to tell us
where he's headed next.

398
00:17:12,553 --> 00:17:14,853
I'll get our guys to give you

399
00:17:14,855 --> 00:17:16,388
whatever you need.

400
00:17:17,258 --> 00:17:18,991
Scans are still coming through,

401
00:17:18,993 --> 00:17:21,260
but I've put what we've got
so far up on the wall.

402
00:17:21,262 --> 00:17:23,262
Sherlock said that
you prefer it that way.

403
00:17:23,264 --> 00:17:25,030
Picked it up from him,
actually.

404
00:17:25,032 --> 00:17:28,600
Makes me feel like I'm really
inside of the problem.

405
00:17:30,704 --> 00:17:33,372
I'll, uh, let you know
if I need anything.

406
00:17:34,275 --> 00:17:35,974
Oh, I work without a shirt.

407
00:17:35,976 --> 00:17:38,911
Sometimes makes me feel
closer to the numbers.

408
00:17:38,913 --> 00:17:42,147
You'll need to, uh,
check the printer in the study

409
00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:43,615
for more pages.

410
00:17:43,617 --> 00:17:45,417
Uh, this is nice,
you know?

411
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:47,452
Meeting another member
of the team.

412
00:17:47,454 --> 00:17:48,654
You know, Team Sherlock.

413
00:17:48,656 --> 00:17:50,656
You help him, I help him...

414
00:17:51,926 --> 00:17:53,559
Obviously, you haven't
tackled a case

415
00:17:53,561 --> 00:17:55,093
with high-order math since
you started working with him,

416
00:17:55,095 --> 00:17:57,729
or we would've...

417
00:17:57,731 --> 00:17:59,031
What?

418
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:00,232
What?

419
00:18:00,234 --> 00:18:01,834
Wait...

420
00:18:01,836 --> 00:18:04,002
have you worked a case
with high-order math?

421
00:18:04,805 --> 00:18:06,238
You have, haven't you?

422
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,840
Does it matter?

423
00:18:07,842 --> 00:18:09,842
Of course it...

424
00:18:09,844 --> 00:18:11,443
Oh, my God.

425
00:18:11,445 --> 00:18:13,278
Did he fire me?

426
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,980
All I know
is that back in London,

427
00:18:14,982 --> 00:18:16,982
we worked a case that involved
Fibonacci spirals...

428
00:18:16,984 --> 00:18:18,483
He fired me.

429
00:18:18,485 --> 00:18:21,386
...and he called some woman
named Indira Patel.

430
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,856
She's at Berkeley.

431
00:18:23,858 --> 00:18:25,624
I'm three time zones closer!

432
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:27,125
You're here now.

433
00:18:27,127 --> 00:18:29,428
Sure, because I found
a dead body.

434
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,531
I have to go; I have to run
some errands for Sherlock.

435
00:18:35,936 --> 00:18:37,903
I-I don't know
what was in the crate,

436
00:18:37,905 --> 00:18:39,271
but the stenciling on
the side indicates

437
00:18:39,273 --> 00:18:40,772
it came from one of
the SUNY schools.

438
00:18:40,774 --> 00:18:42,908
I put another detective
on Keswick...

439
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:45,177
Don't kill me, I had to
use your razor to shave.

440
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:47,179
I...

441
00:18:47,181 --> 00:18:49,147
You must be Andrew.

442
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:50,515
Sherlock Holmes.

443
00:18:50,517 --> 00:18:52,551
Sorry.

444
00:18:52,553 --> 00:18:55,487
Joan said you were coming;
I... I forgot.

445
00:18:55,489 --> 00:18:57,122
It's not how
I wanted to meet you.

446
00:18:57,124 --> 00:18:58,891
She said you can tell
a lot about people

447
00:18:58,893 --> 00:19:00,192
just by looking at them.

448
00:19:00,194 --> 00:19:02,261
I swear, I...
usually wear pants.

449
00:19:02,263 --> 00:19:03,729
Well, in my experience,
most people

450
00:19:03,731 --> 00:19:05,264
need only be concerned
I won't notice

451
00:19:05,266 --> 00:19:06,498
anything worth remarking upon.

452
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:10,535
Watson seems adequately sexed.

453
00:19:11,939 --> 00:19:13,672
Hey.

454
00:19:13,674 --> 00:19:15,674
I was just introducing myself.

455
00:19:17,945 --> 00:19:20,379
I've got that thing.
I'll see you tonight.

456
00:19:20,381 --> 00:19:21,580
Okay.

457
00:19:27,855 --> 00:19:30,188
Your home, Watson...

458
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,823
it's utterly pleasant.

459
00:19:31,825 --> 00:19:33,692
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

460
00:19:33,694 --> 00:19:35,394
When you told me
you wanted a life of your own,

461
00:19:35,396 --> 00:19:36,595
I didn't realize
that you meant you wanted

462
00:19:36,597 --> 00:19:38,030
the same life everyone else has.

463
00:19:38,032 --> 00:19:39,464
But at any rate,
none of my business, is it?

464
00:19:39,466 --> 00:19:41,233
It's not.
And I didn't ask you here

465
00:19:41,235 --> 00:19:42,634
to talk about my apartment.

466
00:19:42,636 --> 00:19:44,970
No, you asked me here
to discuss Kitty.

467
00:19:44,972 --> 00:19:46,471
If she were not
the topic of conversation,

468
00:19:46,473 --> 00:19:48,941
then you wouldn't have
invited me to your home,

469
00:19:48,943 --> 00:19:50,776
where there's no chance
she'll be present.

470
00:19:52,346 --> 00:19:53,946
She disappointed you
in some way.

471
00:19:53,948 --> 00:19:55,247
Skills not up to snuff?

472
00:19:55,249 --> 00:19:57,316
Please remember
she is a novice.

473
00:19:57,318 --> 00:19:58,850
Actually, she did a great job.

474
00:19:58,852 --> 00:20:00,285
But I have some concerns.

475
00:20:00,287 --> 00:20:01,954
I thought we could
talk about them.

476
00:20:03,757 --> 00:20:04,923
You think that
Kitty needs help

477
00:20:04,925 --> 00:20:06,091
above and beyond
my mentorship.

478
00:20:06,093 --> 00:20:07,392
You read the same
file I did.

479
00:20:07,394 --> 00:20:08,894
She's a rape victim.

480
00:20:08,896 --> 00:20:11,296
She was kept and tortured.

481
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,899
Mm.

482
00:20:16,136 --> 00:20:19,171
You know me, so surely you know

483
00:20:19,173 --> 00:20:22,874
I've broached the subject of
a support group meeting before.

484
00:20:22,876 --> 00:20:25,010
Even offered
to pay for therapy.

485
00:20:25,012 --> 00:20:26,812
She's not interested, I know.

486
00:20:26,814 --> 00:20:28,447
Just as you also know

487
00:20:28,449 --> 00:20:30,749
someone with a problem
can't be forced to get help.

488
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:32,551
They have to want it.

489
00:20:32,553 --> 00:20:34,786
What Kitty wants
is to be a detective.

490
00:20:36,523 --> 00:20:38,490
I am taking pains
to try and channel

491
00:20:38,492 --> 00:20:40,592
her residual feelings
into her work.

492
00:20:42,329 --> 00:20:44,463
Well, that works out
great for you.

493
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:48,400
You told me that
you took on a partner

494
00:20:48,402 --> 00:20:50,635
because you wanted to replicate
what you and I had.

495
00:20:50,637 --> 00:20:52,637
That you thought it helped
with your recovery.

496
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:54,539
You think I would
try and take advantage

497
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,208
of the victim of a trauma?

498
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,910
Of course not, but there is
a conflict of interest here.

499
00:20:58,912 --> 00:21:02,447
She needs what she needs,
but you need what you need, too.

500
00:21:06,053 --> 00:21:10,055
It's-it's good that you're
in her life now, Watson.

501
00:21:10,057 --> 00:21:12,524
I mean,
it's commonly believed that, um,

502
00:21:12,526 --> 00:21:16,228
a child benefits mostly from
the presence of two parents.

503
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,164
He-- or she, in this case--
can absorb certain qualities

504
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,466
from the father--
clear-eyed view of the world,

505
00:21:21,468 --> 00:21:23,168
capacity of
rational thought, etcetera.

506
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,170
They can also absorb certain
qualities from the mother.

507
00:21:25,172 --> 00:21:27,105
Excuse me, but I am not
Kitty's mother,

508
00:21:27,107 --> 00:21:28,807
and she sure as hell
is not our child.

509
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:30,942
You brought her here;
she looks up to you.

510
00:21:30,944 --> 00:21:32,944
She says that she doesn't
need help-- fine--

511
00:21:32,946 --> 00:21:34,579
but you know better.

512
00:21:34,581 --> 00:21:37,082
And you're gonna have to be
the one that tells her.

513
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,620
It's Harlan.

514
00:21:41,622 --> 00:21:44,523
Making progress with the maths.

515
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,660
We thought
that Byron and Ike

516
00:21:48,662 --> 00:21:50,462
arrived at Portal Ten
simultaneously.

517
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,664
That would've meant that they
were doing all the same math

518
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,032
at essentially
the same time.

519
00:21:54,034 --> 00:21:56,001
Only, the math
you found at Byron's place

520
00:21:56,003 --> 00:21:57,003
says that's wrong.

521
00:21:57,004 --> 00:21:58,470
He was one step behind Ike.

522
00:21:58,472 --> 00:22:00,705
Are you proposing he did
not kill Mr. Walaczek?

523
00:22:00,707 --> 00:22:03,175
I don't know, but that's
not the weirdest part.

524
00:22:03,177 --> 00:22:04,810
Byron was obsessive.

525
00:22:04,812 --> 00:22:06,211
He time-stamped
almost everything he did.

526
00:22:06,213 --> 00:22:09,047
He only solved
the Portal Nine problem,

527
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:11,316
the same problem that sent me
to that old factory last night.

528
00:22:11,318 --> 00:22:12,884
But get this--

529
00:22:12,886 --> 00:22:14,686
he wasn't given
the same problem as me.

530
00:22:14,688 --> 00:22:16,655
And so it would've yielded
GPS coordinates

531
00:22:16,657 --> 00:22:18,323
for an entirely
different location.

532
00:22:18,325 --> 00:22:21,760
The person in charge of
the game changed the clue

533
00:22:21,762 --> 00:22:23,328
after the police
found Ike's body.

534
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:25,964
Well, he had to, right?

535
00:22:25,966 --> 00:22:27,899
If he hadn't, he would be
sending other competitors

536
00:22:27,901 --> 00:22:29,101
to an active crime scene.

537
00:22:29,103 --> 00:22:30,402
The important thing is

538
00:22:30,404 --> 00:22:31,536
I figured out the coordinates

539
00:22:31,538 --> 00:22:32,771
to the second location.

540
00:22:32,773 --> 00:22:35,540
I know where Byron went.

541
00:22:35,542 --> 00:22:36,842
What are you doing?

542
00:22:36,844 --> 00:22:38,410
You're saying he
time-stamped everything.

543
00:22:38,412 --> 00:22:40,345
I'm looking at the time
he received his clues.

544
00:22:40,347 --> 00:22:42,647
It's all there, to the second,
but what does that have to do...

545
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:44,149
What if you hadn't
found a body?

546
00:22:44,151 --> 00:22:46,118
If the game had
proceeded as planned,

547
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,486
what were you meant
to do there?

548
00:22:47,488 --> 00:22:49,354
I would have sent a text
to the phone number,

549
00:22:49,356 --> 00:22:51,523
the one that the killer painted
over, and then I would have

550
00:22:51,525 --> 00:22:52,891
gotten a message back
with the next problem.

551
00:22:52,893 --> 00:22:54,559
There's an extra
step in there.

552
00:22:54,561 --> 00:22:56,428
Why all this rigmarole with
phone numbers and texts?

553
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,064
Why not just post the problem
itself at the factory?

554
00:22:59,066 --> 00:23:02,100
I don't know, it's just the way
the game is played.

555
00:23:02,102 --> 00:23:04,102
They're for an old
industrial area in Queens.

556
00:23:04,104 --> 00:23:06,805
You're welcome
for finding your suspect.

557
00:23:06,807 --> 00:23:09,207
If I'm right, Harlan,
what you've found...

558
00:23:09,209 --> 00:23:11,109
is the site of
another murder.

559
00:23:11,111 --> 00:23:13,245
Byron Lowenthal's.

560
00:23:15,983 --> 00:23:18,216
You were right,
Lowenthal's dead.

561
00:23:18,218 --> 00:23:20,952
He was shot in the foot,
then the knee.

562
00:23:20,954 --> 00:23:22,821
Just like
Ike Wallaczek.

563
00:23:22,823 --> 00:23:26,391
I'm, uh, gonna look
over here now.

564
00:23:26,393 --> 00:23:29,427
Well, we think the perp
was pulling the body

565
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:31,429
to a car that was parked
over there.

566
00:23:31,431 --> 00:23:34,065
Then he just
left him here.

567
00:23:34,067 --> 00:23:35,901
Probably afraid
he'd been spotted.

568
00:23:35,903 --> 00:23:38,803
There's a lot
of homeless in the area.

569
00:23:41,441 --> 00:23:43,008
Question is:

570
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:45,010
how'd you know
Lowenthal was the next victim

571
00:23:45,012 --> 00:23:46,511
and not the killer?

572
00:23:49,316 --> 00:23:51,750
Well, that's
quite simple, really.

573
00:23:51,752 --> 00:23:54,352
The game is directing
its players to remote locales,

574
00:23:54,354 --> 00:23:56,788
and then instructing them
to send a text message

575
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,256
indicating their presence.

576
00:23:58,258 --> 00:24:00,125
I suspect the killer wanted
to remove the body

577
00:24:00,127 --> 00:24:02,928
so he could keep this new
location “in play,” so to speak.

578
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:05,130
Still missing the “simple” part.

579
00:24:05,132 --> 00:24:06,698
The late Mr. Lowenthal

580
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,366
received his final clue

581
00:24:08,368 --> 00:24:10,235
after Harlan discovered
Ike Wallaczek's body,

582
00:24:10,237 --> 00:24:12,737
but before news of the killing
had reached the media.

583
00:24:12,739 --> 00:24:14,439
That means the
game's designer

584
00:24:14,441 --> 00:24:16,408
knew the location
had been compromised.

585
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,577
And the only way
that he could have known that,

586
00:24:18,579 --> 00:24:20,111
at the time that he knew it,

587
00:24:20,113 --> 00:24:21,880
was if he, himself,
was the killer.

588
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,917
Belphegor's Prime is not
a treasure hunt.

589
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,619
It's a trap.

590
00:24:40,696 --> 00:24:42,196
Better?

591
00:24:42,198 --> 00:24:44,665
False alarm.

592
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:47,668
But I still feel
a little queasy.

593
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,273
This new dead guy--

594
00:24:52,275 --> 00:24:54,875
your friend said that he was
tortured, too, right?

595
00:24:54,877 --> 00:24:57,244
Right before the killer tried
to abscond with his corpse.

596
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:59,213
I assume
he intended to take

597
00:24:59,215 --> 00:25:02,383
Ike Wallaczek away with him
as well, only Ike was too large.

598
00:25:02,385 --> 00:25:04,685
A speedy mothballing
was the best he could do.

599
00:25:04,687 --> 00:25:07,221
So, just to recap,

600
00:25:07,223 --> 00:25:09,657
I've spent the last
few months of my life

601
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:13,360
playing a game that was
designed to kill me.

602
00:25:13,362 --> 00:25:15,629
Got to be a metaphor
in there somewhere, right?

603
00:25:15,631 --> 00:25:18,966
I think the word you're
looking for is “moral.”

604
00:25:18,968 --> 00:25:21,902
There is a moral in there:
games are for idiots.

605
00:25:24,707 --> 00:25:26,473
Breaking news from Ramapo.

606
00:25:26,475 --> 00:25:29,443
Kitty reports the Center for
Applied Mathematics and Logic

607
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,912
is not the sponsor
of Belphegor's Prime.

608
00:25:31,914 --> 00:25:34,148
Then it's got to be
a serial killer, right?

609
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,716
Someone who's obsessed
with mathematicians?

610
00:25:35,718 --> 00:25:37,284
Mm.

611
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,920
Perhaps he was bullied
by mathematicians as a child.

612
00:25:39,922 --> 00:25:42,056
Or mathematicians
killed his parents.

613
00:25:42,058 --> 00:25:43,657
I'm being serious.

614
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:45,726
Serial killers who devise
elaborate death traps

615
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,461
are the stuff of pulp fiction.

616
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:49,229
And besides, with respect
to these murders,

617
00:25:49,231 --> 00:25:51,165
there are none
of the elaborations

618
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:53,767
which mark that sort of culprit.

619
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:55,970
If anything, I would describe
the work as businesslike.

620
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:58,172
Then it's the government.

621
00:25:58,174 --> 00:26:01,241
I mean, the-the game was some
sort of test to weed out people

622
00:26:01,243 --> 00:26:03,243
who could weaponize math.

623
00:26:03,245 --> 00:26:05,179
The American intelligence
apparatus may be clod-like,

624
00:26:05,181 --> 00:26:07,014
but I think they would
do a better job

625
00:26:07,016 --> 00:26:08,749
of disposing of two bodies,
don't you?

626
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:11,785
Watson?

627
00:26:11,787 --> 00:26:13,621
I just heard
from one of the suspects

628
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:14,922
Marcus and I talked to
yesterday,

629
00:26:14,924 --> 00:26:16,290
another puzzle-hunter.

630
00:26:16,292 --> 00:26:18,525
Tell me he confessed
to the murders.

631
00:26:18,527 --> 00:26:20,427
We ruled him out right away,
but he heard about

632
00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:22,329
Byron Lowenthal's murder on
the news and wanted me to know

633
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:25,165
he's at a friend's place,
some guy named Paul.

634
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,934
That is fascinating.

635
00:26:26,936 --> 00:26:28,369
Actually, it might be.

636
00:26:28,371 --> 00:26:31,038
Paul is positive he knows
who the killer is.

637
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,807
I know the guards
are a bit much,

638
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:35,509
but I wanted everyone
to feel safe.

639
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:38,178
And, besides,
math has been good to me.

640
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,279
Commodities.

641
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:40,848
So, you and your friends,

642
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:43,150
you were competitors
in Belphegor's Prime?

643
00:26:43,152 --> 00:26:45,352
Most of us. Some of the others
are just here for the math.

644
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,121
You said you could
identify the killer.

645
00:26:47,123 --> 00:26:49,323
I can, sort of.

646
00:26:52,061 --> 00:26:54,194
“Mo Shellshocker.”

647
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:56,930
It's a pseudonym,
obviously, but I'm telling you,

648
00:26:56,932 --> 00:26:58,365
this is the guy
you're looking for.

649
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,600
I've heard of him.

650
00:26:59,602 --> 00:27:01,335
He uses his blog
to expose bad math.

651
00:27:01,337 --> 00:27:03,837
Corrupt economists, biased
pollsters, that sort of thing.

652
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:05,572
He's actually
sort of a crusader.

653
00:27:05,574 --> 00:27:06,574
He's a murderer.

654
00:27:06,575 --> 00:27:09,143
How can you be
so sure?

655
00:27:09,145 --> 00:27:10,744
When he isn't crusading,
he's competing in puzzle hunts.

656
00:27:10,746 --> 00:27:11,812
A few months ago,

657
00:27:11,814 --> 00:27:13,080
he claimed to
have solved

658
00:27:13,082 --> 00:27:14,815
Cicada 3301 two
years in a row.

659
00:27:14,817 --> 00:27:17,484
Some people called BS,
including...

660
00:27:17,486 --> 00:27:20,120
Ike Wallaczek
and Byron Lowenthal.

661
00:27:20,122 --> 00:27:21,221
“WallaCheckYourMath,”

662
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:22,489
“ByLow2020.”

663
00:27:22,491 --> 00:27:23,757
Those are their
online handles.

664
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:25,392
Their friends
will confirm it.

665
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,528
A flame war does not
a murderer make.

666
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:30,097
The stuff these guys were
slinging at each other was ugly.

667
00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:32,099
Mo knew they were into hunts,
and so he built one

668
00:27:32,101 --> 00:27:34,034
that would send them to places
where he could kill them.

669
00:27:34,036 --> 00:27:35,469
That's what we're
doing here is

670
00:27:35,471 --> 00:27:36,837
we're just sifting
through all the math

671
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:38,338
he's posted on his blog
over the years,

672
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,840
to see if we could
find his signature

673
00:27:39,842 --> 00:27:41,975
or something that
could identify him.

674
00:27:41,977 --> 00:27:45,279
If two people weren't dead,
we'd probably be having fun.

675
00:27:45,281 --> 00:27:46,747
But still, the
chances that he left

676
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:48,582
something like that
in his math...

677
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,784
If it's there, we'll find it.
In the meantime,

678
00:27:50,786 --> 00:27:52,186
we thought the
police should know

679
00:27:52,188 --> 00:27:53,687
who they're really
dealing with.

680
00:27:53,689 --> 00:27:55,389
<i>I've got to go meet someone</i>

681
00:27:55,391 --> 00:27:56,924
about my other case.

682
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:59,927
You're good to pass all this
along to Marcus? Okay.

683
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:03,030
I must say, I'm surprised you
didn't offer to stay and help.

684
00:28:03,032 --> 00:28:05,265
Mr. Ettinger makes
a compelling case with respect

685
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,067
to Mo Shellshocker's
viability as a suspect.

686
00:28:07,069 --> 00:28:09,002
Mo is a genius.

687
00:28:09,004 --> 00:28:10,637
We're talking off the charts.

688
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:12,139
Leibniz meets Euler meets Gauss.

689
00:28:12,141 --> 00:28:14,108
Huh.
He may have an ego,

690
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,110
but he's not gonna kill
anyone over a few comments.

691
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:18,312
So, while “The League of
Concerned Mathematician”"

692
00:28:18,314 --> 00:28:21,014
chases its tail up there, I
am gonna do the smart thing

693
00:28:21,016 --> 00:28:22,416
and get out of town.

694
00:28:22,418 --> 00:28:24,485
You can let me know
when it all blows over.

695
00:28:24,487 --> 00:28:26,386
You're not going
anywhere, Harlan.

696
00:28:26,388 --> 00:28:29,223
Or should I call you
Mo Shellshocker?

697
00:28:32,728 --> 00:28:34,661
Did you honestly think
I wouldn't recognize

698
00:28:34,663 --> 00:28:36,130
an anagram of my own name?

699
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:40,567
I knew I should've gone
with “Choker Hell Moss”"

700
00:28:40,569 --> 00:28:42,569
But I never thought
that you would see it, okay?

701
00:28:42,571 --> 00:28:44,104
Math is my thing, not yours.

702
00:28:44,106 --> 00:28:46,473
It's my name, Harlan;
that makes it my thing.

703
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,675
It was an homage.

704
00:28:48,677 --> 00:28:50,043
Explain.

705
00:28:50,045 --> 00:28:52,045
Every day, all over the world,

706
00:28:52,047 --> 00:28:54,348
math is used to trick people.

707
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,917
Data dredging to sell
pharmaceuticals.

708
00:28:56,919 --> 00:28:59,720
Publication bias
to justify wars.

709
00:28:59,722 --> 00:29:02,322
In the wrong hands, math can be
manipulated, abused.

710
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:05,425
And I decided to do
something about it.

711
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:09,596
You catch people
who murder other people.

712
00:29:09,598 --> 00:29:11,431
I catch people who murder math.

713
00:29:11,433 --> 00:29:14,568
According to this,
Mo is a wanted man.

714
00:29:17,606 --> 00:29:19,940
Harlan?

715
00:29:19,942 --> 00:29:23,110
The D.O.D. was working
on a new fighter.

716
00:29:23,112 --> 00:29:27,047
Only, I knew that the
performance stats were bogus.

717
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:29,116
A friend of mine found
the internal numbers,

718
00:29:29,118 --> 00:29:31,251
and I sort of published them.

719
00:29:31,253 --> 00:29:33,320
So you put classified
Department of Defense documents

720
00:29:33,322 --> 00:29:34,888
on the Internet.

721
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:36,623
Isn't that what
you would have done?

722
00:29:38,928 --> 00:29:41,562
Fine! I screwed up, okay?

723
00:29:41,564 --> 00:29:43,730
But, hey, that's what I do,
right? I screw up.

724
00:29:43,732 --> 00:29:46,233
If I didn't, then probably you
wouldn't have secretly fired me.

725
00:29:46,235 --> 00:29:47,968
Excuse me?

726
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,403
I know about Indira Patel!

727
00:29:51,006 --> 00:29:53,340
I know you replaced me.

728
00:29:55,144 --> 00:29:58,979
Kitty, I think
we could use some tea.

729
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:04,318
Just tell me.

730
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,253
Tell me what math I got wrong.

731
00:30:06,255 --> 00:30:09,356
Tell me why you didn't let me
make it up to you.

732
00:30:09,358 --> 00:30:12,926
It wasn't the maths, it was you.

733
00:30:14,763 --> 00:30:18,232
Your work was impeccable.

734
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:20,334
And for the most part,
I enjoyed our collaborations.

735
00:30:20,336 --> 00:30:24,838
B-But over time, you just...
you became quite... needy.

736
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,406
What are you talking about?

737
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:29,109
Y-You asked my advice
on-on social matters,

738
00:30:29,111 --> 00:30:32,512
and you even invited me
to a party.

739
00:30:32,514 --> 00:30:34,648
You were my friend.

740
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,416
I was your employer, Harlan.

741
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:37,918
A-And you were my consultant.

742
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,419
One of many.

743
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:43,757
I know that I'm a little
obsessed with what I do.

744
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:46,960
That has always made it hard
to make friends.

745
00:30:46,962 --> 00:30:50,664
And I used to feel pretty bad
about that, and then I met you.

746
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:52,566
And I thought to myself,

747
00:30:52,568 --> 00:30:55,903
hey, if it doesn't bother him,
why should I let it bother me?

748
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:03,810
I got a lot
out of the work that we did.

749
00:31:03,812 --> 00:31:06,146
A lot.

750
00:31:06,148 --> 00:31:11,218
But if someone like you thinks
that I'm a loser, then...

751
00:31:22,564 --> 00:31:24,965
Hey, are we still doing this?

752
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:26,366
Doing what?

753
00:31:26,368 --> 00:31:28,502
Talking about the case.

754
00:31:28,504 --> 00:31:30,070
You're just sitting there.

755
00:31:30,072 --> 00:31:32,105
I'm thinking.

756
00:31:32,107 --> 00:31:34,308
I suspect the silence
is exacerbated

757
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,143
by the nature
of our communication.

758
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:37,811
Yes. Well, I don't
live there anymore.

759
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,713
So, if you want
to talk shop at night,

760
00:31:39,715 --> 00:31:41,515
this is the best I can do.

761
00:31:41,517 --> 00:31:45,252
Keep asking myself:
what did the killer want?

762
00:31:45,254 --> 00:31:48,255
He went to great lengths to lure
brilliant mathematicians

763
00:31:48,257 --> 00:31:49,489
to their deaths.

764
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,525
Winnowed out
the less gifted

765
00:31:51,527 --> 00:31:54,061
by making his problems
more and more complicated.

766
00:31:54,063 --> 00:31:57,597
He had a type, but I still think
he's a serial killer

767
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:59,266
only in the most
technical sense.

768
00:31:59,268 --> 00:32:01,201
He tortured both his victims.

769
00:32:01,203 --> 00:32:02,936
But there's no sign
that he enjoyed it.

770
00:32:02,938 --> 00:32:04,538
The work was
utilitarian,

771
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,740
suggesting it was
less for pleasure

772
00:32:06,742 --> 00:32:10,043
and more for persuasion.

773
00:32:10,045 --> 00:32:11,945
He wanted something.

774
00:32:11,947 --> 00:32:13,714
But what?

775
00:32:13,716 --> 00:32:16,483
Maybe there's a connection
between Wallaczek and Lowenthal

776
00:32:16,485 --> 00:32:18,418
we haven't spotted yet.

777
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,220
Maybe they were working
on a project together,

778
00:32:20,222 --> 00:32:21,822
something that was worth
a lot of money.

779
00:32:21,824 --> 00:32:23,857
There's no way the killer
could have predicted

780
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:26,093
which competitors would make it
to the terminal stage.

781
00:32:26,095 --> 00:32:28,795
That part of the game
was beyond his control.

782
00:32:28,797 --> 00:32:30,664
If it weren't,
he would've been prepared

783
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:33,300
to dispose of a body
the size of Ike Wallaczek's.

784
00:32:33,302 --> 00:32:35,335
So, even if there were a
connection between the victims,

785
00:32:35,337 --> 00:32:37,070
the killer could not
have counted on them

786
00:32:37,072 --> 00:32:38,839
being lured into his trap.

787
00:32:38,841 --> 00:32:41,041
Certainly not
in sequence.

788
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:45,112
His game was, in many respects,
one of chance.

789
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:51,718
Suggesting he knows what
he wants, but not who has it.

790
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,888
Like he was on a puzzle hunt
of his own.

791
00:32:56,825 --> 00:32:58,859
I'm back.

792
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:05,665
I'll set up
downstairs, yeah?

793
00:33:09,138 --> 00:33:11,238
I've been thinking about
what you said earlier.

794
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,740
I've decided to engage her
one more time

795
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:15,609
with regards
to her recuperation.

796
00:33:17,112 --> 00:33:21,815
I doubt she'll listen,
but I'll keep you apprised.

797
00:33:25,954 --> 00:33:27,421
I've been thinking.

798
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:29,623
About?
You. Your history.

799
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:31,825
Your decision
not to seek help.

800
00:33:31,827 --> 00:33:34,594
I think it's
a mistake.

801
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,530
Oh?

802
00:33:36,532 --> 00:33:38,198
I've looked into a number
of support groups.

803
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,633
As you are well aware,

804
00:33:39,635 --> 00:33:41,701
I have benefited greatly
from similar settings.

805
00:33:41,703 --> 00:33:43,270
You have.

806
00:33:43,272 --> 00:33:44,638
The process, I find,

807
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,906
is not unlike
voiding one's bowels...

808
00:33:45,908 --> 00:33:47,808
I'll go.
What?

809
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:49,676
I'll go.
Just get me the details.

810
00:33:52,014 --> 00:33:55,182
I've been thinking, too-- about
your number-cruncher, Harlan.

811
00:33:55,184 --> 00:33:57,017
You think I was
too hard on him.

812
00:33:57,019 --> 00:33:58,685
You will have consultants
of your own one day.

813
00:33:58,687 --> 00:34:01,488
You'll see that they require
management and focus.

814
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:04,124
They are but keys on a keyboard,
and we're the typists.

815
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:06,159
You could've given him
a shoeing for all I care.

816
00:34:06,161 --> 00:34:07,828
No, I'm just saying that

817
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:10,030
some of the stuff he's got
up to, it's quite good.

818
00:34:10,032 --> 00:34:11,698
You should take a look.

819
00:34:13,368 --> 00:34:15,735
You may find a fellow typist.

820
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,076
Hello?

821
00:34:23,078 --> 00:34:25,312
Yeah, I
hear that you and some friends

822
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:27,848
are trying to identify
Mo Shellshocker.

823
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,649
That's right. Who is this?

824
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:32,719
His name is Harlan Emple.

825
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:34,020
You got a pen?

826
00:34:34,022 --> 00:34:36,456
I'll-I'll give you his address.

827
00:34:52,454 --> 00:34:54,020
Harlan.

828
00:34:54,022 --> 00:34:56,356
You can't take a hint, can you?

829
00:34:56,358 --> 00:34:57,657
I got your text messages.

830
00:34:57,659 --> 00:34:58,958
I don't want to see you
right now.

831
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,827
So if you came here
to apologize...

832
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:03,363
Actually, I came here
to spare you an agonizing death.

833
00:35:04,299 --> 00:35:05,832
Can I come in?

834
00:35:05,834 --> 00:35:08,301
I was puzzling earlier

835
00:35:08,303 --> 00:35:12,038
as to why the killer went
to such specific lengths.

836
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,606
What did he want?

837
00:35:13,608 --> 00:35:15,809
And then Watson,
quite by accident,

838
00:35:15,811 --> 00:35:17,410
she made a most
compelling analogy.

839
00:35:17,412 --> 00:35:20,080
She said it was as if he
was on a hunt of his own.

840
00:35:20,082 --> 00:35:22,615
Duh. He was hunting
mathematicians.

841
00:35:22,617 --> 00:35:23,783
No, he wasn't.

842
00:35:23,785 --> 00:35:25,151
He was hunting<i> a</i> mathematician.

843
00:35:25,153 --> 00:35:26,619
One.

844
00:35:26,621 --> 00:35:29,389
A man who had concealed
his identity not only

845
00:35:29,391 --> 00:35:31,191
from the mathematics
community at large,

846
00:35:31,193 --> 00:35:32,859
but also from the FBI.

847
00:35:32,861 --> 00:35:35,395
A “crusader,”
you might call him.

848
00:35:35,397 --> 00:35:36,763
Wait a minute.

849
00:35:36,765 --> 00:35:38,731
Are you saying that
this was all about me?

850
00:35:53,448 --> 00:35:56,449
<i> Unfortunately, emulating</i>
<i>the work of people like me</i>

851
00:35:56,451 --> 00:35:59,018
<i>is not without risks.</i>

852
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,320
Creates enemies.

853
00:36:00,322 --> 00:36:02,889
I knew it was the government.

854
00:36:02,891 --> 00:36:04,424
It was a lottery winner.

855
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,260
Little over a year ago,

856
00:36:07,262 --> 00:36:09,529
you started a series of blogs
where you exposed the flaws

857
00:36:09,531 --> 00:36:11,664
in certain scratch card
lottery games.

858
00:36:11,666 --> 00:36:13,766
Tickets like this one.

859
00:36:13,768 --> 00:36:15,802
I wrote about
baited hook games.

860
00:36:15,804 --> 00:36:17,971
Games where the numbers
are printed on the front.

861
00:36:17,973 --> 00:36:20,707
Scratch off the hidden numbers,
hope for a match.

862
00:36:20,709 --> 00:36:23,309
Only, you proved that with
careful mathematical analysis

863
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:25,512
of the visible numbers,
you could predict

864
00:36:25,514 --> 00:36:28,381
which tickets were winners
80% of the time.

865
00:36:28,383 --> 00:36:29,682
If you had exploited

866
00:36:29,684 --> 00:36:32,085
this flaw,
rather than exposing it,

867
00:36:32,087 --> 00:36:33,520
you could have made millions.

868
00:36:33,522 --> 00:36:36,022
Well... sure.
But that would been cheating.

869
00:36:36,024 --> 00:36:37,157
Right.

870
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:38,825
So imagine
for a moment

871
00:36:38,827 --> 00:36:41,060
that you are a less
honest mathematician.

872
00:36:41,062 --> 00:36:42,495
Right?

873
00:36:42,497 --> 00:36:44,063
You've been taking
advantage of these games

874
00:36:44,065 --> 00:36:47,967
for a couple of years to
amass a small fortune.

875
00:36:47,969 --> 00:36:49,502
And then “Mo"
comes along.

876
00:36:49,504 --> 00:36:51,971
He starts exposing
the broken games.

877
00:36:51,973 --> 00:36:54,340
State lottery commissions
shut them down.

878
00:36:54,342 --> 00:36:56,976
The exploitable
games dry up.

879
00:36:56,978 --> 00:37:00,613
Now, if you were a
psychopathic lottery cheat,

880
00:37:00,615 --> 00:37:02,582
how do you fix that?

881
00:37:02,584 --> 00:37:04,484
You kill Mo.

882
00:37:04,486 --> 00:37:07,253
<i>Unfortunately, Mo is elusive.</i>

883
00:37:07,255 --> 00:37:08,821
<i>Anonymous.</i>

884
00:37:08,823 --> 00:37:11,224
The only thing
he knew about him for sure

885
00:37:11,226 --> 00:37:14,394
was that he could not resist
a puzzle hunt.

886
00:37:14,396 --> 00:37:17,130
Now, if you were smart enough
to identify

887
00:37:17,132 --> 00:37:19,399
and take advantage of
broken lottery games...

888
00:37:19,401 --> 00:37:21,868
Then I'm smart enough
to design a puzzle hunt.

889
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:25,338
This plan was not
without its flaws.

890
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:28,775
Once a competitor
reached the terminal stage,

891
00:37:28,777 --> 00:37:32,745
the killer could not be certain
that he'd trapped Mo, could he?

892
00:37:32,747 --> 00:37:34,480
So he tortured them.

893
00:37:34,482 --> 00:37:37,083
I submit he forced them to
log on to Mo's Web site,

894
00:37:37,085 --> 00:37:39,686
and when they failed...

895
00:37:41,323 --> 00:37:42,755
After two murders,

896
00:37:42,757 --> 00:37:44,290
the game was compromised.

897
00:37:44,292 --> 00:37:46,192
So the killer devises
a Plan “B.”

898
00:37:46,194 --> 00:37:47,460
He tricks

899
00:37:47,462 --> 00:37:49,229
a group of his peers

900
00:37:49,231 --> 00:37:51,097
into helping search
for an alternative means

901
00:37:51,099 --> 00:37:53,032
of identifying Mo.

902
00:37:56,504 --> 00:37:58,438
You're talking about that guy.

903
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,906
The one with the penthouse.

904
00:37:59,908 --> 00:38:02,742
<i>Paul?</i>

905
00:38:02,744 --> 00:38:05,044
Lottery winners
are public record.

906
00:38:05,046 --> 00:38:07,814
So when I searched for
the names of repeat winners

907
00:38:07,816 --> 00:38:09,482
in the dates prior
to your posts...

908
00:38:09,484 --> 00:38:11,317
I can't believe
I drank his water.

909
00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:12,685
I called him.

910
00:38:12,687 --> 00:38:14,654
I identified you as Mo.

911
00:38:14,656 --> 00:38:16,122
And I gave him your address.

912
00:38:16,124 --> 00:38:17,590
You what?!

913
00:38:21,129 --> 00:38:23,062
Drop your weapon!

914
00:38:23,064 --> 00:38:24,597
<i>I did not, however, give him</i>

915
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:25,965
<i>the correct apartment number.</i>

916
00:38:25,967 --> 00:38:28,334
He was arrested
a little over an hour ago.

917
00:38:30,739 --> 00:38:31,871
Tried to call you to
tell you, but, um...

918
00:38:31,873 --> 00:38:33,539
But I was ignoring you.

919
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:35,008
Yes, you were ignoring me.

920
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,209
Look, you know

921
00:38:36,211 --> 00:38:37,377
that I'm still screwed, right?

922
00:38:37,379 --> 00:38:39,279
You told him that I'm Mo.

923
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:42,115
He's gonna tell the police,
they're gonna tell the FBI...

924
00:38:42,117 --> 00:38:43,516
The NYPD is under
the impression

925
00:38:43,518 --> 00:38:45,385
that I lied about
your connection to Mo

926
00:38:45,387 --> 00:38:47,920
in order to draw
Mr. Ettinger out.

927
00:38:47,922 --> 00:38:49,555
As far as the
FBI goes, well,

928
00:38:49,557 --> 00:38:51,958
I've got some associates
who have created a trail

929
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,860
which will
strongly suggest that Mo

930
00:38:53,862 --> 00:38:55,728
is a cyber-terrorist
I became aware of

931
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:58,197
whilst working for, um...

932
00:38:58,199 --> 00:38:59,766
queen and country.

933
00:38:59,768 --> 00:39:02,135
Your secret's
quite safe.

934
00:39:02,137 --> 00:39:03,903
Thanks.

935
00:39:06,508 --> 00:39:09,776
My reasons for preserving you
are entirely selfish, Harlan.

936
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:13,279
You are a tremendous asset.

937
00:39:13,281 --> 00:39:15,815
I have little doubt

938
00:39:15,817 --> 00:39:19,118
I will need your help again
in the future.

939
00:39:26,461 --> 00:39:28,528
Me or him?

940
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:29,996
You.

941
00:39:29,998 --> 00:39:31,798
I have an update on
that real estate flipper.

942
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,433
I thought you might
want to know.

943
00:39:39,274 --> 00:39:41,908
I tracked down the truck rental
receipts to get her name.

944
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,142
Valerie Cork.

945
00:39:43,144 --> 00:39:44,911
She's an art authenticator.

946
00:39:44,913 --> 00:39:46,779
And that crate you saw?

947
00:39:46,781 --> 00:39:48,414
There was
something called

948
00:39:48,416 --> 00:39:50,683
a scanning fluorescence
spectrometry machine inside.

949
00:39:50,685 --> 00:39:52,251
They're used...
To find paintings

950
00:39:52,253 --> 00:39:53,553
underneath other paintings.

951
00:39:53,555 --> 00:39:55,288
So it turns out
that the building

952
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:56,689
Chad Keswick was looking to buy

953
00:39:56,691 --> 00:39:59,025
was leased by the WPA
during the Depression.

954
00:39:59,027 --> 00:40:00,927
They commissioned a
mural for the lobby.

955
00:40:00,929 --> 00:40:03,329
The artist was a
notorious communist,

956
00:40:03,331 --> 00:40:05,365
so when the property passed
into private hands in the '50s,

957
00:40:05,367 --> 00:40:06,999
the new owners
had it painted over.

958
00:40:07,001 --> 00:40:08,735
But it was still there,
under the paint.

959
00:40:08,737 --> 00:40:11,037
A lost work by Diego Rivera.

960
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:13,473
It's worth ten times
the price of the building.

961
00:40:14,676 --> 00:40:17,043
I was hoping to leak
the truth to the<i> Times.</i>

962
00:40:18,113 --> 00:40:20,046
I promised you a cut of my fee.

963
00:40:20,048 --> 00:40:22,148
But I'm pretty sure
the mural's gonna end up

964
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:24,384
in the hands of
a historical trust.

965
00:40:24,386 --> 00:40:26,352
I'd feel obligated
to refund my client,

966
00:40:26,354 --> 00:40:28,388
which means you'd get
a cut of nothing.

967
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:31,457
That works for me.

968
00:40:31,459 --> 00:40:33,493
Okay.

969
00:40:35,463 --> 00:40:37,397
I think you should know

970
00:40:37,399 --> 00:40:39,732
that I am going
to a meeting tonight.

971
00:40:41,803 --> 00:40:45,505
One of those
support groups for...

972
00:40:45,507 --> 00:40:47,340
people like me.

973
00:40:47,342 --> 00:40:49,876
It was, uh, Sherlock's idea.

974
00:40:49,878 --> 00:40:51,644
That's great.

975
00:40:51,646 --> 00:40:53,446
I know you put him up to it.

976
00:40:53,448 --> 00:40:55,381
We talked.

977
00:40:57,552 --> 00:41:00,219
When he first approached me
in London,

978
00:41:00,221 --> 00:41:03,556
I was...

979
00:41:03,558 --> 00:41:05,558
in a bad way.

980
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,227
And I had been for a while.

981
00:41:08,229 --> 00:41:11,130
But then,
when he talked about

982
00:41:11,132 --> 00:41:12,365
the work that he did,

983
00:41:12,367 --> 00:41:16,035
about the things
that he saw in me...

984
00:41:18,406 --> 00:41:19,739
I want it.

985
00:41:19,741 --> 00:41:21,874
I want every bit
of what's he offered me,

986
00:41:21,876 --> 00:41:23,843
of what he offered you, but...

987
00:41:23,845 --> 00:41:26,212
if I've learned one thing
over the last few weeks,

988
00:41:26,214 --> 00:41:28,047
it's that he can't pull it off.

989
00:41:28,049 --> 00:41:29,682
Not by himself, anyway.

990
00:41:31,586 --> 00:41:34,153
And if I'm gonna get
what I want,

991
00:41:34,155 --> 00:41:37,690
then I'm going to need
your help, too.

992
00:41:40,361 --> 00:41:42,829
I still think
the meetings are bollocks,

993
00:41:42,831 --> 00:41:44,931
but you say they're important.

994
00:41:44,933 --> 00:41:47,967
They matter to you, so...

995
00:41:47,969 --> 00:41:49,735
What do you say, Watson?

996
00:41:49,737 --> 00:41:52,071
Will you help me?

997
00:41:56,277 --> 00:41:58,244
I don't know how it happened.

998
00:41:58,246 --> 00:42:01,547
It just... hit me.

999
00:42:01,549 --> 00:42:03,983
Like a truck, out of nowhere.

1000
00:42:04,853 --> 00:42:07,753
Work is good.

1001
00:42:07,755 --> 00:42:09,755
I have friends.

1002
00:42:09,757 --> 00:42:13,092
I'm in a
relationship.

1003
00:42:13,094 --> 00:42:16,896
Somewhere along
the way, somehow,

1004
00:42:16,898 --> 00:42:19,732
I stopped being a victim

1005
00:42:19,734 --> 00:42:22,602
and became a survivor.

1006
00:42:22,604 --> 00:42:25,705
So, I guess all I'm saying is,
there's hope.

1007
00:42:26,357 --> 00:42:31,686
Do the work. Love yourself.
There's hope.

1008

00:00:01,521 --> 00:00:03,420
<i>Previously on</i> Elementary...

2
00:00:03,422 --> 00:00:04,761
If you're looking for Sherlock,
he's downstairs.

3
00:00:04,785 --> 00:00:05,841
Okay.

4
00:00:05,842 --> 00:00:07,541
<i>His name is Harlan Emple.</i>

5
00:00:07,543 --> 00:00:09,176
<i>He is the Rachel P. Hanson</i>
<i>Professor</i>

6
00:00:09,178 --> 00:00:11,301
for Applied Mathematics
at Columbia University.

7
00:00:11,301 --> 00:00:14,502
What I don't get is
why he isn't wearing a shirt.

8
00:00:14,504 --> 00:00:17,372
He doesn't like anything to come
between him and the numbers.

9
00:00:17,374 --> 00:00:18,415
What is it?

10
00:00:18,438 --> 00:00:20,274
The answers to your questions
about Kitty.

11
00:00:20,276 --> 00:00:22,710
The truth is she was a
victim of a horrific crime.

12
00:00:22,712 --> 00:00:24,646
<i>After you left last night,</i>

13
00:00:24,648 --> 00:00:26,848
Sherlock gave me an envelope.

14
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,249
Sherlock keeps saying

15
00:00:28,251 --> 00:00:30,385
that I need to get
a better sense of you,

16
00:00:30,387 --> 00:00:33,021
and maybe that will give you
a better sense of me.

17
00:00:42,065 --> 00:00:43,065
It's open.

18
00:00:47,637 --> 00:00:49,003
It's nothing.

19
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:50,872
It's Sherlock and
one of his experts.

20
00:00:50,874 --> 00:00:52,006
Which one?

21
00:00:52,008 --> 00:00:53,241
Phillip something.

22
00:00:53,243 --> 00:00:54,575
Must be new.

23
00:00:54,577 --> 00:00:57,445
He's a knife-thrower.

24
00:00:57,447 --> 00:00:58,913
Why does Sherlock have
a knife-thrower?

25
00:00:58,915 --> 00:01:00,748
He got bored the other day,

26
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,185
started looking into this, uh,
circus accident from the '30s.

27
00:01:04,187 --> 00:01:07,922
The Great Galardo perforated one
of his assistants during an act,

28
00:01:07,924 --> 00:01:09,924
except Sherlock thinks
the blade was thrown

29
00:01:09,926 --> 00:01:11,492
by somebody in the stands,
not Galardo.

30
00:01:11,494 --> 00:01:15,096
Phillip, as far as I
can tell, disagrees.

31
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:18,900
It can't be done, okay?

32
00:01:18,902 --> 00:01:19,934
It was done.

33
00:01:19,936 --> 00:01:21,335
You're wrong.

34
00:01:21,337 --> 00:01:23,538
Nobody can chuck
a knife that far.

35
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,239
What's this?

36
00:01:25,241 --> 00:01:26,207
You're...

37
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:27,209
Not here.

38
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,509
I'm not here.

39
00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:29,711
Remember that, okay?

40
00:01:29,713 --> 00:01:31,279
Oh, yes. Heaven
forfend your work

41
00:01:31,281 --> 00:01:33,247
with me should endanger
your precious day job.

42
00:01:33,249 --> 00:01:35,116
You throw knives?

43
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,252
You know, it was supposed
to be just you here.

44
00:01:38,254 --> 00:01:41,355
Phillip is arguably the greatest
knife-thrower in the world.

45
00:01:41,357 --> 00:01:42,790
Has been for decades.

46
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:43,925
Only, there's little money

47
00:01:43,927 --> 00:01:45,193
to be made
in the impalement arts.

48
00:01:45,195 --> 00:01:46,494
So, as a youth, he turned

49
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,563
to what you Americans
term “football”"

50
00:01:48,565 --> 00:01:50,131
Is this a joke?

51
00:01:53,837 --> 00:01:55,002
Phillip, head
and heart.

52
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:56,904
Come on.
Head and heart.

53
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:06,814
Can I go?

54
00:02:06,816 --> 00:02:09,484
Yeah.

55
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,489
15 years he spent throwing
that misshapen ball around.

56
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:16,057
15 years.

57
00:02:16,059 --> 00:02:18,259
When I think of the acclaim
he could have brought

58
00:02:18,261 --> 00:02:20,828
to competitive blade slinging.

59
00:02:27,237 --> 00:02:29,036
You're following me,
Watson.

60
00:02:29,038 --> 00:02:30,338
I don't like it.

61
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,740
I want you to help
me with something.

62
00:02:32,742 --> 00:02:33,908
This is Chad Keswick.

63
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,976
He buys distressed
buildings,

64
00:02:34,978 --> 00:02:36,210
paints, spackles,

65
00:02:36,212 --> 00:02:37,645
and then flips them
for quick money.

66
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:39,180
Who'd he kill?
No one.

67
00:02:39,182 --> 00:02:41,315
I was hired by one of
his rivals to find out

68
00:02:41,317 --> 00:02:43,017
why he's been circling
this old office building

69
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:44,218
in Jamaica, Queens.

70
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,586
She wants to know
why he thinks

71
00:02:45,588 --> 00:02:47,355
the building is
a good investment.

72
00:02:47,357 --> 00:02:49,590
Is there a crime in there,
something worth investigating?

73
00:02:49,592 --> 00:02:50,925
Well, I've been
shadowing Keswick,

74
00:02:50,927 --> 00:02:52,593
but yesterday I think
he noticed me.

75
00:02:52,595 --> 00:02:54,595
I want to switch
up the tail.

76
00:02:54,597 --> 00:02:57,231
You followed me for over
a week before I noticed you.

77
00:02:57,233 --> 00:02:59,033
Help me out, and I'll
cut you in on my fee.

78
00:02:59,035 --> 00:03:02,003
I don't work for you,
I work for Sherlock.

79
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:03,437
I worked for him, too.

80
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,773
And, in my experience,
he was always supportive

81
00:03:05,775 --> 00:03:07,942
of taking on work
outside the partnership.

82
00:03:07,944 --> 00:03:10,912
Sorry, it's not my cup of tea.

83
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:33,034
Hello, Portal Ten.

84
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,247
I'm here, Belphegor.

85
00:03:46,249 --> 00:03:49,784
So where is the next clue?

89
00:04:41,686 --> 00:04:45,355
Look, for the last time,
I was playing a game!

90
00:04:45,356 --> 00:04:47,456
Yeah, you called it
a puzzle hunt.

91
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,491
Belphegor's Prime.

92
00:04:50,761 --> 00:04:53,262
Think Cicada 3301
or Octorine's Challenge.

93
00:04:54,365 --> 00:04:55,631
They're math games.

94
00:04:55,633 --> 00:04:56,865
Math-- maybe you've heard of it.

95
00:04:56,867 --> 00:04:58,333
I've got some math for you.

96
00:04:58,335 --> 00:05:00,335
One dead guy
plus one live guy

97
00:05:00,337 --> 00:05:02,104
found in the same
deserted factory.

98
00:05:02,106 --> 00:05:06,108
I was not “found” there;
I am the one who called 911.

99
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,310
I was waiting there
for the police.

100
00:05:08,312 --> 00:05:09,745
Mr. Emple,

101
00:05:09,747 --> 00:05:11,613
we're just trying
to do our jobs, all right?

102
00:05:11,615 --> 00:05:13,048
First officers
on the scene described you

103
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,516
as “extremely agitated.”

104
00:05:14,518 --> 00:05:15,984
Well, of course
I was agitated.

105
00:05:15,986 --> 00:05:18,754
I had just found
a dead guy in mothballs!

106
00:05:18,756 --> 00:05:21,790
And did I mention that I have
not slept in almost two days?

107
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:23,358
Because of the math game.

108
00:05:24,762 --> 00:05:26,195
Can I borrow those?

109
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:31,100
This...

110
00:05:31,102 --> 00:05:33,302
is Belphegor's Prime, okay?

111
00:05:33,304 --> 00:05:35,304
It's a numeric palindrome.

112
00:05:35,306 --> 00:05:40,776
It's 666 bookended by 13 zeroes
and then bracketed with ones.

113
00:05:40,778 --> 00:05:43,846
Named for the demon Belphegor
who was a prince of hell.

114
00:05:43,848 --> 00:05:46,448
The first clue for the hunt
started making the rounds

115
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,883
a few months ago.

116
00:05:47,885 --> 00:05:49,651
It was a JPEG with two numbers
hidden in it.

117
00:05:49,653 --> 00:05:51,453
You divide those numbers
by Belphegor's Prime,

118
00:05:51,455 --> 00:05:54,890
and you get the GPS coordinates
for a restroom at the Bronx Zoo.

119
00:05:54,892 --> 00:05:56,959
You go to the restroom,
you find a phone number.

120
00:05:56,961 --> 00:05:58,927
You send a text to the number,
you get the next clue.

121
00:05:58,929 --> 00:05:59,962
Which is another math problem.

122
00:05:59,964 --> 00:06:00,929
Exactly.

123
00:06:00,931 --> 00:06:02,397
Only, this one is harder.

124
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,099
And that's how it works.

125
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:05,934
You know, but for
each one that you solve,

126
00:06:05,936 --> 00:06:08,103
you get a new set
of GPS coordinates.

127
00:06:08,105 --> 00:06:11,473
And that means that you've
completed a stage, or a portal.

128
00:06:11,475 --> 00:06:13,509
And last night,
I was on Portal Ten.

129
00:06:13,511 --> 00:06:15,711
And...

130
00:06:17,014 --> 00:06:18,313
You know what?

131
00:06:18,315 --> 00:06:20,015
I want to talk
to Sherlock and Joan.

132
00:06:20,017 --> 00:06:21,917
Look, Mr. Emple...
No, I'm sorry.

133
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,019
I told the police down
at the factory that I know them.

134
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:25,287
Isn't that the whole reason

135
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:26,922
that I was brought here
to this squad?

136
00:06:26,924 --> 00:06:30,392
I-I am not saying another word
until they are here.

137
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:35,264
Harlan Emple is
indeed an acquaintance.

138
00:06:35,266 --> 00:06:37,733
He is, in point of fact,
one of my “irregulars.”

139
00:06:37,735 --> 00:06:38,801
One of your what?

140
00:06:38,803 --> 00:06:40,302
Irregulars.

141
00:06:40,304 --> 00:06:41,770
I'm your consultant, Captain;
they are mine.

142
00:06:41,772 --> 00:06:43,572
They're a handful
of experts I turn to

143
00:06:43,574 --> 00:06:46,108
when I encounter problems which
are beyond my pool of knowledge.

144
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,810
Harlan is
a brilliant mathematician.

145
00:06:47,812 --> 00:06:49,778
And on the handful of occasions
I have tackled a case

146
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,046
which pertained
to mathematics...

147
00:06:51,048 --> 00:06:53,182
He helped you out.
Well, the good news

148
00:06:53,184 --> 00:06:56,018
for him is the preliminary
autopsy report just came in

149
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,252
before you got here.

150
00:06:57,254 --> 00:06:59,021
And the M.E. puts
the time of death

151
00:06:59,023 --> 00:07:00,989
between 4:00 and
6:00 p.m. last night.

152
00:07:00,991 --> 00:07:02,124
Mr. Emple was teaching

153
00:07:02,126 --> 00:07:03,358
a class at Columbia.

154
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,394
So the victim is
yet to be identified?

155
00:07:05,396 --> 00:07:07,663
No I.D., no phone.

156
00:07:07,665 --> 00:07:09,865
First detective on the scene
liked it for a mob hit,

157
00:07:09,867 --> 00:07:11,500
so while we're
running the prints,

158
00:07:11,502 --> 00:07:13,602
he's showing the vic's
face around OCID.

159
00:07:13,604 --> 00:07:16,839
Marcus here was about to walk
the scene with Mr. Emple.

160
00:07:16,841 --> 00:07:18,774
You're here now;
you might as well tag along.

161
00:07:18,776 --> 00:07:21,009
Actually, Captain,
I'm quite busy today.

162
00:07:21,011 --> 00:07:22,978
This is a John Doe,
and we got nothing.

163
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,247
And, like you just said,
you're my consultant.

164
00:07:25,249 --> 00:07:26,748
So, go consult.

165
00:07:29,787 --> 00:07:30,986
Watson.

166
00:07:30,988 --> 00:07:32,588
Um, he's your friend.

167
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,523
Actually, Kitty is
otherwise engaged,

168
00:07:34,525 --> 00:07:37,426
and he did actually help both
of us with a case last year.

169
00:07:37,428 --> 00:07:38,493
Did he not?

170
00:07:40,865 --> 00:07:44,099
Have I told you
how good it is to see you?

171
00:07:44,101 --> 00:07:45,367
Yes, you have.
Three times.

172
00:07:45,369 --> 00:07:46,468
Well, it is.

173
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,636
Hey, lousy circumstances.

174
00:07:47,638 --> 00:07:49,371
But, uh, hey...

175
00:07:49,373 --> 00:07:51,740
I heard from your boss that you
just, uh, got back from London.

176
00:07:51,742 --> 00:07:53,308
Were you working
a case or...?

177
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,576
No, I moved back there.

178
00:07:54,578 --> 00:07:55,677
You mean<i> moved,</i> moved?

179
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:56,845
Is there another
definition?

180
00:07:56,847 --> 00:07:58,513
I was there for
eight months,

181
00:07:58,515 --> 00:08:00,883
and had a change of heart
and returned to New York.

182
00:08:00,885 --> 00:08:02,517
So, you moved to London,
and you didn't, uh...

183
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,086
You know what?
Doesn't even matter.

184
00:08:04,088 --> 00:08:05,387
The point is you're back!

185
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:07,389
Mr. Emple.
Uh, duty calls.

186
00:08:07,391 --> 00:08:09,024
Yeah.

187
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:18,634
It's interesting.

188
00:08:18,636 --> 00:08:20,068
Mothballs are interesting?

189
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,070
They were taken from
that cabinet over there.

190
00:08:22,072 --> 00:08:25,941
Obviously, to cover the smell
of John Doe's decay.

191
00:08:25,943 --> 00:08:28,043
The killer didn't
bring them with him.

192
00:08:28,045 --> 00:08:31,179
Perhaps leaving the body here
was not part of his plan, hmm?

193
00:08:32,983 --> 00:08:36,018
Doe was shot in the foot
first and then the knee.

194
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,453
Either those were
two really bad misses or...

195
00:08:38,455 --> 00:08:41,256
Or the killer was torturing him.

196
00:08:41,258 --> 00:08:43,892
This doesn't seem like anything
you can't handle on your own.

197
00:08:43,894 --> 00:08:45,994
So you want to tell me why you
really asked me to come here?

198
00:08:45,996 --> 00:08:48,363
“This doesn't seem like anything
you can't handle on your own.”

199
00:08:48,365 --> 00:08:49,765
That's funny.

200
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:51,566
That's exactly what
I would have said

201
00:08:51,568 --> 00:08:53,602
had I been present when you
asked Kitty for her assistance

202
00:08:53,604 --> 00:08:54,937
with your tawdry side job.

203
00:08:54,939 --> 00:08:57,372
“Tawdry”?
I wanted you to know I approve.

204
00:08:57,374 --> 00:08:59,007
Of what?

205
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:01,376
Your agenda
with regards to Kitty.

206
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:03,078
Several days ago,
I gave you her file.

207
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,913
And then you show up at
the brownstone yesterday,

208
00:09:04,915 --> 00:09:06,515
and you invite her
into an investigation.

209
00:09:06,517 --> 00:09:08,183
Coincidence? No, I think not.

210
00:09:08,185 --> 00:09:11,320
You feel for her.
And now you wish to engage.

211
00:09:11,322 --> 00:09:13,956
It's not an outcome
I would have predicted, no.

212
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,458
But it is one
I approve of, yeah.

213
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,193
She could learn
a great deal from you,

214
00:09:18,195 --> 00:09:20,228
especially with regards
to how to get the most

215
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,864
from my tutelage.

216
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:25,734
So, I've already dispatched her
to, uh, follow your Mr. Keswick.

217
00:09:25,736 --> 00:09:27,836
But that's not
what I actually...

218
00:09:27,838 --> 00:09:29,404
Harlan!

219
00:09:30,741 --> 00:09:33,075
You came here to retrieve
a phone number, did you not?

220
00:09:33,077 --> 00:09:34,609
You would send a text,
and then receive

221
00:09:34,611 --> 00:09:36,845
the next clue in the game
that you were playing.

222
00:09:36,847 --> 00:09:38,747
Yeah, but I didn't find it.

223
00:09:38,749 --> 00:09:40,048
Not that I kept looking

224
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,250
after the dead guy
fell out of the locker.

225
00:09:42,252 --> 00:09:44,052
Yeah, CSU didn't find
any number either.

226
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:46,154
Probably because
it's under that paint.

227
00:09:46,156 --> 00:09:48,190
It's fresh.

228
00:09:48,192 --> 00:09:49,891
Applied in the last

229
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:52,694
24 hours.

230
00:09:52,696 --> 00:09:54,696
Right after John Doe's murder,
I'd wager.

231
00:09:54,698 --> 00:09:57,099
You don't think
this was a mob hit?

232
00:09:57,101 --> 00:09:59,101
Doe and the killer were
playing the game, too.

233
00:09:59,103 --> 00:10:01,203
The killer shot Doe and
then covered up the number

234
00:10:01,205 --> 00:10:02,704
so no one else could use it.

235
00:10:02,706 --> 00:10:04,806
What's the prize
in your little contest?

236
00:10:04,808 --> 00:10:07,576
Well, I'm doing it
mostly for the math.

237
00:10:07,578 --> 00:10:11,480
But, uh, $1,707,071.

238
00:10:11,482 --> 00:10:13,882
It's another
palindromic prime.

239
00:10:13,884 --> 00:10:17,152
Did I not mention the
money at the station?

240
00:10:17,154 --> 00:10:18,587
Who the hell can afford

241
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:20,655
that kind of payout
for a puzzle hunt?

242
00:10:20,657 --> 00:10:22,124
Well, most people
think it's CAML.

243
00:10:22,126 --> 00:10:24,593
The Center for Applied
Mathematics and Logic.

244
00:10:24,595 --> 00:10:26,094
It's located
in Ramapo...

245
00:10:26,096 --> 00:10:27,729
Wait, most people
“think” it's them?

246
00:10:27,731 --> 00:10:29,331
Well, hunts like these,

247
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,266
the organizers are
almost always anonymous.

248
00:10:31,268 --> 00:10:32,401
It's S.O.P.

249
00:10:32,403 --> 00:10:34,302
What about the
contestants?

250
00:10:34,304 --> 00:10:37,005
Is anonymity
also S.O.P.?

251
00:10:37,007 --> 00:10:39,207
For the most part, yeah.

252
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:43,078
But, guys, math peeps
are my peeps, okay?

253
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,314
It's, uh, like
a community, sort of.

254
00:10:46,316 --> 00:10:48,984
I can think of ten
or 12 other people

255
00:10:48,986 --> 00:10:50,018
who were probably competing.

256
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,186
Would that help?

257
00:10:53,157 --> 00:10:55,223
No.

258
00:10:55,225 --> 00:10:58,026
I'm sorry, I don't know him.

259
00:10:58,028 --> 00:11:00,862
But you admit you were
competing in Belphegor's Prime.

260
00:11:00,864 --> 00:11:02,197
I do.

261
00:11:04,835 --> 00:11:05,934
Pepe!

262
00:11:08,172 --> 00:11:10,439
Sorry. He doesn't
like strangers.

263
00:11:12,109 --> 00:11:14,443
Give him one of these.

264
00:11:14,445 --> 00:11:16,111
Get on his good side.

265
00:11:24,288 --> 00:11:26,354
What are you doing?

266
00:11:28,225 --> 00:11:30,725
I'm just verifying that
you've been lying to us.

267
00:11:30,727 --> 00:11:33,895
You did know the
dead man, did you not?

268
00:11:33,897 --> 00:11:36,998
I reviewed his personal
effects at the morgue earlier.

269
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,034
The coroner reported finding
crumbs in one of his pockets.

270
00:11:39,036 --> 00:11:40,036
I tasted one.

271
00:11:40,037 --> 00:11:41,269
Why would you...?

272
00:11:41,271 --> 00:11:42,771
At first, I thought
they were from

273
00:11:42,773 --> 00:11:44,439
a particularly rancid
brand of cheese,

274
00:11:44,441 --> 00:11:47,609
but, no... they're from
one of Pepe's treats.

275
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:49,277
Homemade?

276
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,481
Harlan was able to give us
the names of nine other people

277
00:11:52,483 --> 00:11:54,149
he believed to be
other competitors.

278
00:11:54,151 --> 00:11:55,984
Our colleagues are
investigating them as we speak,

279
00:11:55,986 --> 00:11:57,919
but I'll quite happily
recommend that the NYPD

280
00:11:57,921 --> 00:12:00,222
focus its attention
entirely on you.

281
00:12:04,128 --> 00:12:06,428
His name was Ike Walaczek.

282
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,231
In another lifetime,
he was my boyfriend.

283
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:10,866
And what of
this lifetime?

284
00:12:10,868 --> 00:12:12,701
We were working together.

285
00:12:12,703 --> 00:12:14,769
On Belphegor's.
What?!

286
00:12:14,771 --> 00:12:16,705
He was a numerical analyst
at the Tory Foundation.

287
00:12:16,707 --> 00:12:17,873
I work mostly in combinatorics.

288
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,307
I thought we would make
a good team.

289
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:20,742
But there aren't
supposed to be teams.

290
00:12:20,744 --> 00:12:22,711
Not in a puzzle hunt.
It's bad form.

291
00:12:22,713 --> 00:12:23,713
Harlan...

292
00:12:23,714 --> 00:12:25,514
I'm just saying...

293
00:12:25,516 --> 00:12:27,315
My husband
wouldn't understand,

294
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:30,385
so I decided I wouldn't tell him
until after we won the money.

295
00:12:30,387 --> 00:12:33,121
A team-- so that's how
you got there before me.

296
00:12:33,123 --> 00:12:34,489
I wasn't there.

297
00:12:34,491 --> 00:12:36,258
Tom and I were out of town
until this morning.

298
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,126
His cousin
was getting married in Hawaii.

299
00:12:38,128 --> 00:12:40,662
That's why Ike went
to the coordinates by himself.

300
00:12:40,664 --> 00:12:42,097
Because I couldn't.

301
00:12:44,268 --> 00:12:46,601
These are pictures I took.

302
00:12:46,603 --> 00:12:49,337
Check the dates.

303
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:51,506
You gave the police
nine other names?

304
00:12:51,508 --> 00:12:53,408
People you thought
were competing?

305
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,776
I've got 16.

306
00:12:54,778 --> 00:12:56,311
And I know they were competing.

307
00:12:58,448 --> 00:13:01,249
He talked to her
outside the Jamaica property

308
00:13:01,251 --> 00:13:05,720
for about 20 minutes,
and then this truck rolled up.

309
00:13:05,722 --> 00:13:07,822
Any idea what's
inside the crate?

310
00:13:07,824 --> 00:13:09,024
Nope.

311
00:13:09,026 --> 00:13:10,392
I can't identify
the woman either.

312
00:13:10,394 --> 00:13:12,260
Everything about her
said money though.

313
00:13:12,262 --> 00:13:15,363
She, Keswick
and the mystery box

314
00:13:15,365 --> 00:13:17,732
stayed inside the building
for about three hours,

315
00:13:17,734 --> 00:13:20,001
and then off they went.

316
00:13:20,904 --> 00:13:22,170
Good.

317
00:13:22,172 --> 00:13:23,872
Okay.

318
00:13:23,874 --> 00:13:26,074
You know where
to send the check.

319
00:13:26,076 --> 00:13:30,145
You haven't asked me about
the file Sherlock gave me.

320
00:13:30,147 --> 00:13:32,080
Why would I?

321
00:13:32,082 --> 00:13:36,184
You said it would give me
a better sense of you-- it did.

322
00:13:37,588 --> 00:13:40,155
That's why you asked
for my help.

323
00:13:40,157 --> 00:13:41,990
Because you felt sorry for me.

324
00:13:41,992 --> 00:13:44,226
No.

325
00:13:44,228 --> 00:13:46,194
You just don't seem interested
in anything

326
00:13:46,196 --> 00:13:48,063
outside of becoming
a detective.

327
00:13:48,065 --> 00:13:50,999
There she is.

328
00:13:51,001 --> 00:13:53,301
The old counselor.

329
00:13:53,303 --> 00:13:55,637
Who used to hold
Sherlock's hand.

330
00:13:57,608 --> 00:13:59,741
Everything that you read,

331
00:13:59,743 --> 00:14:02,510
everything that happened to me,
that's all it is.

332
00:14:02,512 --> 00:14:04,646
It's just something
that happened.

333
00:14:04,648 --> 00:14:08,116
And it's all
in the past now.

334
00:14:08,118 --> 00:14:10,685
So let's just
leave it there, shall we?

335
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:24,667
Hello.

336
00:14:24,668 --> 00:14:26,001
You've had sex.

337
00:14:26,003 --> 00:14:27,202
Excuse me?

338
00:14:27,204 --> 00:14:28,503
I can hear it
in your voice.

339
00:14:28,505 --> 00:14:29,771
You've joined paunches.

340
00:14:29,773 --> 00:14:30,972
Good for you, Watson.

341
00:14:30,974 --> 00:14:32,807
As you know, I think
the act of love

342
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:34,676
can be quite conducive to...
What do you want?

343
00:14:34,678 --> 00:14:36,911
Merely to apprise you
of a new development

344
00:14:36,913 --> 00:14:38,280
in the murder of
Ike Walaczek.

345
00:14:38,282 --> 00:14:40,115
As I informed
you yesterday,

346
00:14:40,117 --> 00:14:42,284
Harlan and I were given
a new list of competitors.

347
00:14:42,286 --> 00:14:45,320
One name leapt out:
Byron Lowenthal.

348
00:14:45,322 --> 00:14:48,156
He's a statistician at the
Public Utilities Commission

349
00:14:48,158 --> 00:14:50,425
and a diagnosed
paranoid schizophrenic.

350
00:14:50,427 --> 00:14:52,160
He's been hospitalized
for becoming violent

351
00:14:52,162 --> 00:14:53,728
on no fewer
than three occasions.

352
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,964
Certainly sounds like
it could be our guy.

353
00:14:55,966 --> 00:14:59,367
Unfortunately, Mr. Lowenthal had
another break earlier this year.

354
00:14:59,369 --> 00:15:02,137
He's been staying in
a transient hotel ever since.

355
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:04,239
Detective Bell and I
are going to speak with him.

356
00:15:04,241 --> 00:15:05,307
You want me to meet you?

357
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:06,875
Oh, no, we're already here.

358
00:15:06,877 --> 00:15:08,410
Anyway, now that I know
that you've enjoyed coitus

359
00:15:08,412 --> 00:15:09,778
and could enjoy more
in the near future...

360
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,846
When you're done,
we need to talk.

361
00:15:14,718 --> 00:15:16,818
Byron Lowenthal,
you in there?

362
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,053
Who is it?

363
00:15:18,055 --> 00:15:19,754
It's Detective Bell, NYPD.

364
00:15:19,756 --> 00:15:22,257
My colleague and I would like
to ask you some questions.

365
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:24,592
Let me
get some pants on.

366
00:15:37,341 --> 00:15:40,008
S-Sorry, I just... I, um...

367
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,310
I-I thought I heard
Mr. Lowenthal retr...

368
00:16:19,154 --> 00:16:21,267
You guys got lucky.

369
00:16:21,268 --> 00:16:22,868
Well, luck had little
to do with it, actually.

370
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,536
I... I heard Mr. Lowenthal

371
00:16:24,538 --> 00:16:27,039
pulling a heavy object off
a shelf, placing it on his bed,

372
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,041
and the sound of
the zipper indicated

373
00:16:29,043 --> 00:16:30,976
that it was
a large gun case.

374
00:16:30,978 --> 00:16:33,579
Looks like he was sane enough
to do math, but not much else.

375
00:16:33,581 --> 00:16:34,747
Plus, he was
pretty hopped up.

376
00:16:34,749 --> 00:16:36,448
Caffeine pills,
energy drinks,

377
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,251
pretty much every legal
stimulant you can buy.

378
00:16:39,253 --> 00:16:40,853
Plus a few illegal ones.

379
00:16:40,855 --> 00:16:42,821
Hmm. Obviously, he was
keeping himself awake

380
00:16:42,823 --> 00:16:44,490
so he could work on
Belphegor's.

381
00:16:44,492 --> 00:16:47,392
This... is obvious to you?

382
00:16:47,394 --> 00:16:48,961
I confess the maths
are beyond me,

383
00:16:48,963 --> 00:16:51,130
but I took the liberty of
sending pictures of what

384
00:16:51,132 --> 00:16:52,865
appear to be Mr. Lowenthal's
most recent scribbles

385
00:16:52,867 --> 00:16:54,166
to Harlan Emple,
and he's confirmed

386
00:16:54,168 --> 00:16:55,667
they are part of the contest.

387
00:16:55,669 --> 00:16:56,969
With your permission,
I'd like copies of these

388
00:16:56,971 --> 00:16:58,837
sent to my home
so he can review them.

389
00:16:58,839 --> 00:16:59,972
What for?

390
00:16:59,974 --> 00:17:01,073
If Byron Lowenthal

391
00:17:01,075 --> 00:17:02,441
did kill Ike Walaczek,

392
00:17:02,443 --> 00:17:04,109
then he used
and obscured a phone number,

393
00:17:04,111 --> 00:17:05,878
which would have yielded
the next problem.

394
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,379
That problem's solution

395
00:17:07,381 --> 00:17:08,714
would be GPS coordinates.

396
00:17:08,716 --> 00:17:10,415
If he's recorded them
in his books...

397
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:12,551
Your pal will be able to tell us
where he's headed next.

398
00:17:12,553 --> 00:17:14,853
I'll get our guys to give you

399
00:17:14,855 --> 00:17:16,388
whatever you need.

400
00:17:17,258 --> 00:17:18,991
Scans are still coming through,

401
00:17:18,993 --> 00:17:21,260
but I've put what we've got
so far up on the wall.

402
00:17:21,262 --> 00:17:23,262
Sherlock said that
you prefer it that way.

403
00:17:23,264 --> 00:17:25,030
Picked it up from him,
actually.

404
00:17:25,032 --> 00:17:28,600
Makes me feel like I'm really
inside of the problem.

405
00:17:30,704 --> 00:17:33,372
I'll, uh, let you know
if I need anything.

406
00:17:34,275 --> 00:17:35,974
Oh, I work without a shirt.

407
00:17:35,976 --> 00:17:38,911
Sometimes makes me feel
closer to the numbers.

408
00:17:38,913 --> 00:17:42,147
You'll need to, uh,
check the printer in the study

409
00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:43,615
for more pages.

410
00:17:43,617 --> 00:17:45,417
Uh, this is nice,
you know?

411
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:47,452
Meeting another member
of the team.

412
00:17:47,454 --> 00:17:48,654
You know, Team Sherlock.

413
00:17:48,656 --> 00:17:50,656
You help him, I help him...

414
00:17:51,926 --> 00:17:53,559
Obviously, you haven't
tackled a case

415
00:17:53,561 --> 00:17:55,093
with high-order math since
you started working with him,

416
00:17:55,095 --> 00:17:57,729
or we would've...

417
00:17:57,731 --> 00:17:59,031
What?

418
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:00,232
What?

419
00:18:00,234 --> 00:18:01,834
Wait...

420
00:18:01,836 --> 00:18:04,002
have you worked a case
with high-order math?

421
00:18:04,805 --> 00:18:06,238
You have, haven't you?

422
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,840
Does it matter?

423
00:18:07,842 --> 00:18:09,842
Of course it...

424
00:18:09,844 --> 00:18:11,443
Oh, my God.

425
00:18:11,445 --> 00:18:13,278
Did he fire me?

426
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,980
All I know
is that back in London,

427
00:18:14,982 --> 00:18:16,982
we worked a case that involved
Fibonacci spirals...

428
00:18:16,984 --> 00:18:18,483
He fired me.

429
00:18:18,485 --> 00:18:21,386
...and he called some woman
named Indira Patel.

430
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,856
She's at Berkeley.

431
00:18:23,858 --> 00:18:25,624
I'm three time zones closer!

432
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:27,125
You're here now.

433
00:18:27,127 --> 00:18:29,428
Sure, because I found
a dead body.

434
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,531
I have to go; I have to run
some errands for Sherlock.

435
00:18:35,936 --> 00:18:37,903
I-I don't know
what was in the crate,

436
00:18:37,905 --> 00:18:39,271
but the stenciling on
the side indicates

437
00:18:39,273 --> 00:18:40,772
it came from one of
the SUNY schools.

438
00:18:40,774 --> 00:18:42,908
I put another detective
on Keswick...

439
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:45,177
Don't kill me, I had to
use your razor to shave.

440
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:47,179
I...

441
00:18:47,181 --> 00:18:49,147
You must be Andrew.

442
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:50,515
Sherlock Holmes.

443
00:18:50,517 --> 00:18:52,551
Sorry.

444
00:18:52,553 --> 00:18:55,487
Joan said you were coming;
I... I forgot.

445
00:18:55,489 --> 00:18:57,122
It's not how
I wanted to meet you.

446
00:18:57,124 --> 00:18:58,891
She said you can tell
a lot about people

447
00:18:58,893 --> 00:19:00,192
just by looking at them.

448
00:19:00,194 --> 00:19:02,261
I swear, I...
usually wear pants.

449
00:19:02,263 --> 00:19:03,729
Well, in my experience,
most people

450
00:19:03,731 --> 00:19:05,264
need only be concerned
I won't notice

451
00:19:05,266 --> 00:19:06,498
anything worth remarking upon.

452
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:10,535
Watson seems adequately sexed.

453
00:19:11,939 --> 00:19:13,672
Hey.

454
00:19:13,674 --> 00:19:15,674
I was just introducing myself.

455
00:19:17,945 --> 00:19:20,379
I've got that thing.
I'll see you tonight.

456
00:19:20,381 --> 00:19:21,580
Okay.

457
00:19:27,855 --> 00:19:30,188
Your home, Watson...

458
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,823
it's utterly pleasant.

459
00:19:31,825 --> 00:19:33,692
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

460
00:19:33,694 --> 00:19:35,394
When you told me
you wanted a life of your own,

461
00:19:35,396 --> 00:19:36,595
I didn't realize
that you meant you wanted

462
00:19:36,597 --> 00:19:38,030
the same life everyone else has.

463
00:19:38,032 --> 00:19:39,464
But at any rate,
none of my business, is it?

464
00:19:39,466 --> 00:19:41,233
It's not.
And I didn't ask you here

465
00:19:41,235 --> 00:19:42,634
to talk about my apartment.

466
00:19:42,636 --> 00:19:44,970
No, you asked me here
to discuss Kitty.

467
00:19:44,972 --> 00:19:46,471
If she were not
the topic of conversation,

468
00:19:46,473 --> 00:19:48,941
then you wouldn't have
invited me to your home,

469
00:19:48,943 --> 00:19:50,776
where there's no chance
she'll be present.

470
00:19:52,346 --> 00:19:53,946
She disappointed you
in some way.

471
00:19:53,948 --> 00:19:55,247
Skills not up to snuff?

472
00:19:55,249 --> 00:19:57,316
Please remember
she is a novice.

473
00:19:57,318 --> 00:19:58,850
Actually, she did a great job.

474
00:19:58,852 --> 00:20:00,285
But I have some concerns.

475
00:20:00,287 --> 00:20:01,954
I thought we could
talk about them.

476
00:20:03,757 --> 00:20:04,923
You think that
Kitty needs help

477
00:20:04,925 --> 00:20:06,091
above and beyond
my mentorship.

478
00:20:06,093 --> 00:20:07,392
You read the same
file I did.

479
00:20:07,394 --> 00:20:08,894
She's a rape victim.

480
00:20:08,896 --> 00:20:11,296
She was kept and tortured.

481
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,899
Mm.

482
00:20:16,136 --> 00:20:19,171
You know me, so surely you know

483
00:20:19,173 --> 00:20:22,874
I've broached the subject of
a support group meeting before.

484
00:20:22,876 --> 00:20:25,010
Even offered
to pay for therapy.

485
00:20:25,012 --> 00:20:26,812
She's not interested, I know.

486
00:20:26,814 --> 00:20:28,447
Just as you also know

487
00:20:28,449 --> 00:20:30,749
someone with a problem
can't be forced to get help.

488
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:32,551
They have to want it.

489
00:20:32,553 --> 00:20:34,786
What Kitty wants
is to be a detective.

490
00:20:36,523 --> 00:20:38,490
I am taking pains
to try and channel

491
00:20:38,492 --> 00:20:40,592
her residual feelings
into her work.

492
00:20:42,329 --> 00:20:44,463
Well, that works out
great for you.

493
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:48,400
You told me that
you took on a partner

494
00:20:48,402 --> 00:20:50,635
because you wanted to replicate
what you and I had.

495
00:20:50,637 --> 00:20:52,637
That you thought it helped
with your recovery.

496
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:54,539
You think I would
try and take advantage

497
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,208
of the victim of a trauma?

498
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,910
Of course not, but there is
a conflict of interest here.

499
00:20:58,912 --> 00:21:02,447
She needs what she needs,
but you need what you need, too.

500
00:21:06,053 --> 00:21:10,055
It's-it's good that you're
in her life now, Watson.

501
00:21:10,057 --> 00:21:12,524
I mean,
it's commonly believed that, um,

502
00:21:12,526 --> 00:21:16,228
a child benefits mostly from
the presence of two parents.

503
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,164
He-- or she, in this case--
can absorb certain qualities

504
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,466
from the father--
clear-eyed view of the world,

505
00:21:21,468 --> 00:21:23,168
capacity of
rational thought, etcetera.

506
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,170
They can also absorb certain
qualities from the mother.

507
00:21:25,172 --> 00:21:27,105
Excuse me, but I am not
Kitty's mother,

508
00:21:27,107 --> 00:21:28,807
and she sure as hell
is not our child.

509
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:30,942
You brought her here;
she looks up to you.

510
00:21:30,944 --> 00:21:32,944
She says that she doesn't
need help-- fine--

511
00:21:32,946 --> 00:21:34,579
but you know better.

512
00:21:34,581 --> 00:21:37,082
And you're gonna have to be
the one that tells her.

513
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,620
It's Harlan.

514
00:21:41,622 --> 00:21:44,523
Making progress with the maths.

515
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,660
We thought
that Byron and Ike

516
00:21:48,662 --> 00:21:50,462
arrived at Portal Ten
simultaneously.

517
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,664
That would've meant that they
were doing all the same math

518
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,032
at essentially
the same time.

519
00:21:54,034 --> 00:21:56,001
Only, the math
you found at Byron's place

520
00:21:56,003 --> 00:21:57,003
says that's wrong.

521
00:21:57,004 --> 00:21:58,470
He was one step behind Ike.

522
00:21:58,472 --> 00:22:00,705
Are you proposing he did
not kill Mr. Walaczek?

523
00:22:00,707 --> 00:22:03,175
I don't know, but that's
not the weirdest part.

524
00:22:03,177 --> 00:22:04,810
Byron was obsessive.

525
00:22:04,812 --> 00:22:06,211
He time-stamped
almost everything he did.

526
00:22:06,213 --> 00:22:09,047
He only solved
the Portal Nine problem,

527
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:11,316
the same problem that sent me
to that old factory last night.

528
00:22:11,318 --> 00:22:12,884
But get this--

529
00:22:12,886 --> 00:22:14,686
he wasn't given
the same problem as me.

530
00:22:14,688 --> 00:22:16,655
And so it would've yielded
GPS coordinates

531
00:22:16,657 --> 00:22:18,323
for an entirely
different location.

532
00:22:18,325 --> 00:22:21,760
The person in charge of
the game changed the clue

533
00:22:21,762 --> 00:22:23,328
after the police
found Ike's body.

534
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:25,964
Well, he had to, right?

535
00:22:25,966 --> 00:22:27,899
If he hadn't, he would be
sending other competitors

536
00:22:27,901 --> 00:22:29,101
to an active crime scene.

537
00:22:29,103 --> 00:22:30,402
The important thing is

538
00:22:30,404 --> 00:22:31,536
I figured out the coordinates

539
00:22:31,538 --> 00:22:32,771
to the second location.

540
00:22:32,773 --> 00:22:35,540
I know where Byron went.

541
00:22:35,542 --> 00:22:36,842
What are you doing?

542
00:22:36,844 --> 00:22:38,410
You're saying he
time-stamped everything.

543
00:22:38,412 --> 00:22:40,345
I'm looking at the time
he received his clues.

544
00:22:40,347 --> 00:22:42,647
It's all there, to the second,
but what does that have to do...

545
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:44,149
What if you hadn't
found a body?

546
00:22:44,151 --> 00:22:46,118
If the game had
proceeded as planned,

547
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,486
what were you meant
to do there?

548
00:22:47,488 --> 00:22:49,354
I would have sent a text
to the phone number,

549
00:22:49,356 --> 00:22:51,523
the one that the killer painted
over, and then I would have

550
00:22:51,525 --> 00:22:52,891
gotten a message back
with the next problem.

551
00:22:52,893 --> 00:22:54,559
There's an extra
step in there.

552
00:22:54,561 --> 00:22:56,428
Why all this rigmarole with
phone numbers and texts?

553
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,064
Why not just post the problem
itself at the factory?

554
00:22:59,066 --> 00:23:02,100
I don't know, it's just the way
the game is played.

555
00:23:02,102 --> 00:23:04,102
They're for an old
industrial area in Queens.

556
00:23:04,104 --> 00:23:06,805
You're welcome
for finding your suspect.

557
00:23:06,807 --> 00:23:09,207
If I'm right, Harlan,
what you've found...

558
00:23:09,209 --> 00:23:11,109
is the site of
another murder.

559
00:23:11,111 --> 00:23:13,245
Byron Lowenthal's.

560
00:23:15,983 --> 00:23:18,216
You were right,
Lowenthal's dead.

561
00:23:18,218 --> 00:23:20,952
He was shot in the foot,
then the knee.

562
00:23:20,954 --> 00:23:22,821
Just like
Ike Wallaczek.

563
00:23:22,823 --> 00:23:26,391
I'm, uh, gonna look
over here now.

564
00:23:26,393 --> 00:23:29,427
Well, we think the perp
was pulling the body

565
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:31,429
to a car that was parked
over there.

566
00:23:31,431 --> 00:23:34,065
Then he just
left him here.

567
00:23:34,067 --> 00:23:35,901
Probably afraid
he'd been spotted.

568
00:23:35,903 --> 00:23:38,803
There's a lot
of homeless in the area.

569
00:23:41,441 --> 00:23:43,008
Question is:

570
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:45,010
how'd you know
Lowenthal was the next victim

571
00:23:45,012 --> 00:23:46,511
and not the killer?

572
00:23:49,316 --> 00:23:51,750
Well, that's
quite simple, really.

573
00:23:51,752 --> 00:23:54,352
The game is directing
its players to remote locales,

574
00:23:54,354 --> 00:23:56,788
and then instructing them
to send a text message

575
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,256
indicating their presence.

576
00:23:58,258 --> 00:24:00,125
I suspect the killer wanted
to remove the body

577
00:24:00,127 --> 00:24:02,928
so he could keep this new
location “in play,” so to speak.

578
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:05,130
Still missing the “simple” part.

579
00:24:05,132 --> 00:24:06,698
The late Mr. Lowenthal

580
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,366
received his final clue

581
00:24:08,368 --> 00:24:10,235
after Harlan discovered
Ike Wallaczek's body,

582
00:24:10,237 --> 00:24:12,737
but before news of the killing
had reached the media.

583
00:24:12,739 --> 00:24:14,439
That means the
game's designer

584
00:24:14,441 --> 00:24:16,408
knew the location
had been compromised.

585
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,577
And the only way
that he could have known that,

586
00:24:18,579 --> 00:24:20,111
at the time that he knew it,

587
00:24:20,113 --> 00:24:21,880
was if he, himself,
was the killer.

588
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,917
Belphegor's Prime is not
a treasure hunt.

589
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,619
It's a trap.

590
00:24:40,696 --> 00:24:42,196
Better?

591
00:24:42,198 --> 00:24:44,665
False alarm.

592
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:47,668
But I still feel
a little queasy.

593
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,273
This new dead guy--

594
00:24:52,275 --> 00:24:54,875
your friend said that he was
tortured, too, right?

595
00:24:54,877 --> 00:24:57,244
Right before the killer tried
to abscond with his corpse.

596
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:59,213
I assume
he intended to take

597
00:24:59,215 --> 00:25:02,383
Ike Wallaczek away with him
as well, only Ike was too large.

598
00:25:02,385 --> 00:25:04,685
A speedy mothballing
was the best he could do.

599
00:25:04,687 --> 00:25:07,221
So, just to recap,

600
00:25:07,223 --> 00:25:09,657
I've spent the last
few months of my life

601
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:13,360
playing a game that was
designed to kill me.

602
00:25:13,362 --> 00:25:15,629
Got to be a metaphor
in there somewhere, right?

603
00:25:15,631 --> 00:25:18,966
I think the word you're
looking for is “moral.”

604
00:25:18,968 --> 00:25:21,902
There is a moral in there:
games are for idiots.

605
00:25:24,707 --> 00:25:26,473
Breaking news from Ramapo.

606
00:25:26,475 --> 00:25:29,443
Kitty reports the Center for
Applied Mathematics and Logic

607
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,912
is not the sponsor
of Belphegor's Prime.

608
00:25:31,914 --> 00:25:34,148
Then it's got to be
a serial killer, right?

609
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,716
Someone who's obsessed
with mathematicians?

610
00:25:35,718 --> 00:25:37,284
Mm.

611
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,920
Perhaps he was bullied
by mathematicians as a child.

612
00:25:39,922 --> 00:25:42,056
Or mathematicians
killed his parents.

613
00:25:42,058 --> 00:25:43,657
I'm being serious.

614
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:45,726
Serial killers who devise
elaborate death traps

615
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,461
are the stuff of pulp fiction.

616
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:49,229
And besides, with respect
to these murders,

617
00:25:49,231 --> 00:25:51,165
there are none
of the elaborations

618
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:53,767
which mark that sort of culprit.

619
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:55,970
If anything, I would describe
the work as businesslike.

620
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:58,172
Then it's the government.

621
00:25:58,174 --> 00:26:01,241
I mean, the-the game was some
sort of test to weed out people

622
00:26:01,243 --> 00:26:03,243
who could weaponize math.

623
00:26:03,245 --> 00:26:05,179
The American intelligence
apparatus may be clod-like,

624
00:26:05,181 --> 00:26:07,014
but I think they would
do a better job

625
00:26:07,016 --> 00:26:08,749
of disposing of two bodies,
don't you?

626
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:11,785
Watson?

627
00:26:11,787 --> 00:26:13,621
I just heard
from one of the suspects

628
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:14,922
Marcus and I talked to
yesterday,

629
00:26:14,924 --> 00:26:16,290
another puzzle-hunter.

630
00:26:16,292 --> 00:26:18,525
Tell me he confessed
to the murders.

631
00:26:18,527 --> 00:26:20,427
We ruled him out right away,
but he heard about

632
00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:22,329
Byron Lowenthal's murder on
the news and wanted me to know

633
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:25,165
he's at a friend's place,
some guy named Paul.

634
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,934
That is fascinating.

635
00:26:26,936 --> 00:26:28,369
Actually, it might be.

636
00:26:28,371 --> 00:26:31,038
Paul is positive he knows
who the killer is.

637
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,807
I know the guards
are a bit much,

638
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:35,509
but I wanted everyone
to feel safe.

639
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:38,178
And, besides,
math has been good to me.

640
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,279
Commodities.

641
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:40,848
So, you and your friends,

642
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:43,150
you were competitors
in Belphegor's Prime?

643
00:26:43,152 --> 00:26:45,352
Most of us. Some of the others
are just here for the math.

644
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,121
You said you could
identify the killer.

645
00:26:47,123 --> 00:26:49,323
I can, sort of.

646
00:26:52,061 --> 00:26:54,194
“Mo Shellshocker.”

647
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:56,930
It's a pseudonym,
obviously, but I'm telling you,

648
00:26:56,932 --> 00:26:58,365
this is the guy
you're looking for.

649
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,600
I've heard of him.

650
00:26:59,602 --> 00:27:01,335
He uses his blog
to expose bad math.

651
00:27:01,337 --> 00:27:03,837
Corrupt economists, biased
pollsters, that sort of thing.

652
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:05,572
He's actually
sort of a crusader.

653
00:27:05,574 --> 00:27:06,574
He's a murderer.

654
00:27:06,575 --> 00:27:09,143
How can you be
so sure?

655
00:27:09,145 --> 00:27:10,744
When he isn't crusading,
he's competing in puzzle hunts.

656
00:27:10,746 --> 00:27:11,812
A few months ago,

657
00:27:11,814 --> 00:27:13,080
he claimed to
have solved

658
00:27:13,082 --> 00:27:14,815
Cicada 3301 two
years in a row.

659
00:27:14,817 --> 00:27:17,484
Some people called BS,
including...

660
00:27:17,486 --> 00:27:20,120
Ike Wallaczek
and Byron Lowenthal.

661
00:27:20,122 --> 00:27:21,221
“WallaCheckYourMath,”

662
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:22,489
“ByLow2020.”

663
00:27:22,491 --> 00:27:23,757
Those are their
online handles.

664
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:25,392
Their friends
will confirm it.

665
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,528
A flame war does not
a murderer make.

666
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:30,097
The stuff these guys were
slinging at each other was ugly.

667
00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:32,099
Mo knew they were into hunts,
and so he built one

668
00:27:32,101 --> 00:27:34,034
that would send them to places
where he could kill them.

669
00:27:34,036 --> 00:27:35,469
That's what we're
doing here is

670
00:27:35,471 --> 00:27:36,837
we're just sifting
through all the math

671
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:38,338
he's posted on his blog
over the years,

672
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,840
to see if we could
find his signature

673
00:27:39,842 --> 00:27:41,975
or something that
could identify him.

674
00:27:41,977 --> 00:27:45,279
If two people weren't dead,
we'd probably be having fun.

675
00:27:45,281 --> 00:27:46,747
But still, the
chances that he left

676
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:48,582
something like that
in his math...

677
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,784
If it's there, we'll find it.
In the meantime,

678
00:27:50,786 --> 00:27:52,186
we thought the
police should know

679
00:27:52,188 --> 00:27:53,687
who they're really
dealing with.

680
00:27:53,689 --> 00:27:55,389
<i>I've got to go meet someone</i>

681
00:27:55,391 --> 00:27:56,924
about my other case.

682
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:59,927
You're good to pass all this
along to Marcus? Okay.

683
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:03,030
I must say, I'm surprised you
didn't offer to stay and help.

684
00:28:03,032 --> 00:28:05,265
Mr. Ettinger makes
a compelling case with respect

685
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,067
to Mo Shellshocker's
viability as a suspect.

686
00:28:07,069 --> 00:28:09,002
Mo is a genius.

687
00:28:09,004 --> 00:28:10,637
We're talking off the charts.

688
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:12,139
Leibniz meets Euler meets Gauss.

689
00:28:12,141 --> 00:28:14,108
Huh.
He may have an ego,

690
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,110
but he's not gonna kill
anyone over a few comments.

691
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:18,312
So, while “The League of
Concerned Mathematician”"

692
00:28:18,314 --> 00:28:21,014
chases its tail up there, I
am gonna do the smart thing

693
00:28:21,016 --> 00:28:22,416
and get out of town.

694
00:28:22,418 --> 00:28:24,485
You can let me know
when it all blows over.

695
00:28:24,487 --> 00:28:26,386
You're not going
anywhere, Harlan.

696
00:28:26,388 --> 00:28:29,223
Or should I call you
Mo Shellshocker?

697
00:28:32,728 --> 00:28:34,661
Did you honestly think
I wouldn't recognize

698
00:28:34,663 --> 00:28:36,130
an anagram of my own name?

699
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:40,567
I knew I should've gone
with “Choker Hell Moss”"

700
00:28:40,569 --> 00:28:42,569
But I never thought
that you would see it, okay?

701
00:28:42,571 --> 00:28:44,104
Math is my thing, not yours.

702
00:28:44,106 --> 00:28:46,473
It's my name, Harlan;
that makes it my thing.

703
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,675
It was an homage.

704
00:28:48,677 --> 00:28:50,043
Explain.

705
00:28:50,045 --> 00:28:52,045
Every day, all over the world,

706
00:28:52,047 --> 00:28:54,348
math is used to trick people.

707
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,917
Data dredging to sell
pharmaceuticals.

708
00:28:56,919 --> 00:28:59,720
Publication bias
to justify wars.

709
00:28:59,722 --> 00:29:02,322
In the wrong hands, math can be
manipulated, abused.

710
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:05,425
And I decided to do
something about it.

711
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:09,596
You catch people
who murder other people.

712
00:29:09,598 --> 00:29:11,431
I catch people who murder math.

713
00:29:11,433 --> 00:29:14,568
According to this,
Mo is a wanted man.

714
00:29:17,606 --> 00:29:19,940
Harlan?

715
00:29:19,942 --> 00:29:23,110
The D.O.D. was working
on a new fighter.

716
00:29:23,112 --> 00:29:27,047
Only, I knew that the
performance stats were bogus.

717
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:29,116
A friend of mine found
the internal numbers,

718
00:29:29,118 --> 00:29:31,251
and I sort of published them.

719
00:29:31,253 --> 00:29:33,320
So you put classified
Department of Defense documents

720
00:29:33,322 --> 00:29:34,888
on the Internet.

721
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:36,623
Isn't that what
you would have done?

722
00:29:38,928 --> 00:29:41,562
Fine! I screwed up, okay?

723
00:29:41,564 --> 00:29:43,730
But, hey, that's what I do,
right? I screw up.

724
00:29:43,732 --> 00:29:46,233
If I didn't, then probably you
wouldn't have secretly fired me.

725
00:29:46,235 --> 00:29:47,968
Excuse me?

726
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,403
I know about Indira Patel!

727
00:29:51,006 --> 00:29:53,340
I know you replaced me.

728
00:29:55,144 --> 00:29:58,979
Kitty, I think
we could use some tea.

729
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:04,318
Just tell me.

730
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,253
Tell me what math I got wrong.

731
00:30:06,255 --> 00:30:09,356
Tell me why you didn't let me
make it up to you.

732
00:30:09,358 --> 00:30:12,926
It wasn't the maths, it was you.

733
00:30:14,763 --> 00:30:18,232
Your work was impeccable.

734
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:20,334
And for the most part,
I enjoyed our collaborations.

735
00:30:20,336 --> 00:30:24,838
B-But over time, you just...
you became quite... needy.

736
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,406
What are you talking about?

737
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:29,109
Y-You asked my advice
on-on social matters,

738
00:30:29,111 --> 00:30:32,512
and you even invited me
to a party.

739
00:30:32,514 --> 00:30:34,648
You were my friend.

740
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,416
I was your employer, Harlan.

741
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:37,918
A-And you were my consultant.

742
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,419
One of many.

743
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:43,757
I know that I'm a little
obsessed with what I do.

744
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:46,960
That has always made it hard
to make friends.

745
00:30:46,962 --> 00:30:50,664
And I used to feel pretty bad
about that, and then I met you.

746
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:52,566
And I thought to myself,

747
00:30:52,568 --> 00:30:55,903
hey, if it doesn't bother him,
why should I let it bother me?

748
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:03,810
I got a lot
out of the work that we did.

749
00:31:03,812 --> 00:31:06,146
A lot.

750
00:31:06,148 --> 00:31:11,218
But if someone like you thinks
that I'm a loser, then...

751
00:31:22,564 --> 00:31:24,965
Hey, are we still doing this?

752
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:26,366
Doing what?

753
00:31:26,368 --> 00:31:28,502
Talking about the case.

754
00:31:28,504 --> 00:31:30,070
You're just sitting there.

755
00:31:30,072 --> 00:31:32,105
I'm thinking.

756
00:31:32,107 --> 00:31:34,308
I suspect the silence
is exacerbated

757
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,143
by the nature
of our communication.

758
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:37,811
Yes. Well, I don't
live there anymore.

759
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,713
So, if you want
to talk shop at night,

760
00:31:39,715 --> 00:31:41,515
this is the best I can do.

761
00:31:41,517 --> 00:31:45,252
Keep asking myself:
what did the killer want?

762
00:31:45,254 --> 00:31:48,255
He went to great lengths to lure
brilliant mathematicians

763
00:31:48,257 --> 00:31:49,489
to their deaths.

764
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,525
Winnowed out
the less gifted

765
00:31:51,527 --> 00:31:54,061
by making his problems
more and more complicated.

766
00:31:54,063 --> 00:31:57,597
He had a type, but I still think
he's a serial killer

767
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:59,266
only in the most
technical sense.

768
00:31:59,268 --> 00:32:01,201
He tortured both his victims.

769
00:32:01,203 --> 00:32:02,936
But there's no sign
that he enjoyed it.

770
00:32:02,938 --> 00:32:04,538
The work was
utilitarian,

771
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,740
suggesting it was
less for pleasure

772
00:32:06,742 --> 00:32:10,043
and more for persuasion.

773
00:32:10,045 --> 00:32:11,945
He wanted something.

774
00:32:11,947 --> 00:32:13,714
But what?

775
00:32:13,716 --> 00:32:16,483
Maybe there's a connection
between Wallaczek and Lowenthal

776
00:32:16,485 --> 00:32:18,418
we haven't spotted yet.

777
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,220
Maybe they were working
on a project together,

778
00:32:20,222 --> 00:32:21,822
something that was worth
a lot of money.

779
00:32:21,824 --> 00:32:23,857
There's no way the killer
could have predicted

780
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:26,093
which competitors would make it
to the terminal stage.

781
00:32:26,095 --> 00:32:28,795
That part of the game
was beyond his control.

782
00:32:28,797 --> 00:32:30,664
If it weren't,
he would've been prepared

783
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:33,300
to dispose of a body
the size of Ike Wallaczek's.

784
00:32:33,302 --> 00:32:35,335
So, even if there were a
connection between the victims,

785
00:32:35,337 --> 00:32:37,070
the killer could not
have counted on them

786
00:32:37,072 --> 00:32:38,839
being lured into his trap.

787
00:32:38,841 --> 00:32:41,041
Certainly not
in sequence.

788
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:45,112
His game was, in many respects,
one of chance.

789
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:51,718
Suggesting he knows what
he wants, but not who has it.

790
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,888
Like he was on a puzzle hunt
of his own.

791
00:32:56,825 --> 00:32:58,859
I'm back.

792
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:05,665
I'll set up
downstairs, yeah?

793
00:33:09,138 --> 00:33:11,238
I've been thinking about
what you said earlier.

794
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,740
I've decided to engage her
one more time

795
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:15,609
with regards
to her recuperation.

796
00:33:17,112 --> 00:33:21,815
I doubt she'll listen,
but I'll keep you apprised.

797
00:33:25,954 --> 00:33:27,421
I've been thinking.

798
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:29,623
About?
You. Your history.

799
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:31,825
Your decision
not to seek help.

800
00:33:31,827 --> 00:33:34,594
I think it's
a mistake.

801
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,530
Oh?

802
00:33:36,532 --> 00:33:38,198
I've looked into a number
of support groups.

803
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,633
As you are well aware,

804
00:33:39,635 --> 00:33:41,701
I have benefited greatly
from similar settings.

805
00:33:41,703 --> 00:33:43,270
You have.

806
00:33:43,272 --> 00:33:44,638
The process, I find,

807
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,906
is not unlike
voiding one's bowels...

808
00:33:45,908 --> 00:33:47,808
I'll go.
What?

809
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:49,676
I'll go.
Just get me the details.

810
00:33:52,014 --> 00:33:55,182
I've been thinking, too-- about
your number-cruncher, Harlan.

811
00:33:55,184 --> 00:33:57,017
You think I was
too hard on him.

812
00:33:57,019 --> 00:33:58,685
You will have consultants
of your own one day.

813
00:33:58,687 --> 00:34:01,488
You'll see that they require
management and focus.

814
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:04,124
They are but keys on a keyboard,
and we're the typists.

815
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:06,159
You could've given him
a shoeing for all I care.

816
00:34:06,161 --> 00:34:07,828
No, I'm just saying that

817
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:10,030
some of the stuff he's got
up to, it's quite good.

818
00:34:10,032 --> 00:34:11,698
You should take a look.

819
00:34:13,368 --> 00:34:15,735
You may find a fellow typist.

820
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,076
Hello?

821
00:34:23,078 --> 00:34:25,312
Yeah, I
hear that you and some friends

822
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:27,848
are trying to identify
Mo Shellshocker.

823
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,649
That's right. Who is this?

824
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:32,719
His name is Harlan Emple.

825
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:34,020
You got a pen?

826
00:34:34,022 --> 00:34:36,456
I'll-I'll give you his address.

827
00:34:52,454 --> 00:34:54,020
Harlan.

828
00:34:54,022 --> 00:34:56,356
You can't take a hint, can you?

829
00:34:56,358 --> 00:34:57,657
I got your text messages.

830
00:34:57,659 --> 00:34:58,958
I don't want to see you
right now.

831
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,827
So if you came here
to apologize...

832
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:03,363
Actually, I came here
to spare you an agonizing death.

833
00:35:04,299 --> 00:35:05,832
Can I come in?

834
00:35:05,834 --> 00:35:08,301
I was puzzling earlier

835
00:35:08,303 --> 00:35:12,038
as to why the killer went
to such specific lengths.

836
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,606
What did he want?

837
00:35:13,608 --> 00:35:15,809
And then Watson,
quite by accident,

838
00:35:15,811 --> 00:35:17,410
she made a most
compelling analogy.

839
00:35:17,412 --> 00:35:20,080
She said it was as if he
was on a hunt of his own.

840
00:35:20,082 --> 00:35:22,615
Duh. He was hunting
mathematicians.

841
00:35:22,617 --> 00:35:23,783
No, he wasn't.

842
00:35:23,785 --> 00:35:25,151
He was hunting<i> a</i> mathematician.

843
00:35:25,153 --> 00:35:26,619
One.

844
00:35:26,621 --> 00:35:29,389
A man who had concealed
his identity not only

845
00:35:29,391 --> 00:35:31,191
from the mathematics
community at large,

846
00:35:31,193 --> 00:35:32,859
but also from the FBI.

847
00:35:32,861 --> 00:35:35,395
A “crusader,”
you might call him.

848
00:35:35,397 --> 00:35:36,763
Wait a minute.

849
00:35:36,765 --> 00:35:38,731
Are you saying that
this was all about me?

850
00:35:53,448 --> 00:35:56,449
<i> Unfortunately, emulating</i>
<i>the work of people like me</i>

851
00:35:56,451 --> 00:35:59,018
<i>is not without risks.</i>

852
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,320
Creates enemies.

853
00:36:00,322 --> 00:36:02,889
I knew it was the government.

854
00:36:02,891 --> 00:36:04,424
It was a lottery winner.

855
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,260
Little over a year ago,

856
00:36:07,262 --> 00:36:09,529
you started a series of blogs
where you exposed the flaws

857
00:36:09,531 --> 00:36:11,664
in certain scratch card
lottery games.

858
00:36:11,666 --> 00:36:13,766
Tickets like this one.

859
00:36:13,768 --> 00:36:15,802
I wrote about
baited hook games.

860
00:36:15,804 --> 00:36:17,971
Games where the numbers
are printed on the front.

861
00:36:17,973 --> 00:36:20,707
Scratch off the hidden numbers,
hope for a match.

862
00:36:20,709 --> 00:36:23,309
Only, you proved that with
careful mathematical analysis

863
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:25,512
of the visible numbers,
you could predict

864
00:36:25,514 --> 00:36:28,381
which tickets were winners
80% of the time.

865
00:36:28,383 --> 00:36:29,682
If you had exploited

866
00:36:29,684 --> 00:36:32,085
this flaw,
rather than exposing it,

867
00:36:32,087 --> 00:36:33,520
you could have made millions.

868
00:36:33,522 --> 00:36:36,022
Well... sure.
But that would been cheating.

869
00:36:36,024 --> 00:36:37,157
Right.

870
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:38,825
So imagine
for a moment

871
00:36:38,827 --> 00:36:41,060
that you are a less
honest mathematician.

872
00:36:41,062 --> 00:36:42,495
Right?

873
00:36:42,497 --> 00:36:44,063
You've been taking
advantage of these games

874
00:36:44,065 --> 00:36:47,967
for a couple of years to
amass a small fortune.

875
00:36:47,969 --> 00:36:49,502
And then “Mo"
comes along.

876
00:36:49,504 --> 00:36:51,971
He starts exposing
the broken games.

877
00:36:51,973 --> 00:36:54,340
State lottery commissions
shut them down.

878
00:36:54,342 --> 00:36:56,976
The exploitable
games dry up.

879
00:36:56,978 --> 00:37:00,613
Now, if you were a
psychopathic lottery cheat,

880
00:37:00,615 --> 00:37:02,582
how do you fix that?

881
00:37:02,584 --> 00:37:04,484
You kill Mo.

882
00:37:04,486 --> 00:37:07,253
<i>Unfortunately, Mo is elusive.</i>

883
00:37:07,255 --> 00:37:08,821
<i>Anonymous.</i>

884
00:37:08,823 --> 00:37:11,224
The only thing
he knew about him for sure

885
00:37:11,226 --> 00:37:14,394
was that he could not resist
a puzzle hunt.

886
00:37:14,396 --> 00:37:17,130
Now, if you were smart enough
to identify

887
00:37:17,132 --> 00:37:19,399
and take advantage of
broken lottery games...

888
00:37:19,401 --> 00:37:21,868
Then I'm smart enough
to design a puzzle hunt.

889
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:25,338
This plan was not
without its flaws.

890
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:28,775
Once a competitor
reached the terminal stage,

891
00:37:28,777 --> 00:37:32,745
the killer could not be certain
that he'd trapped Mo, could he?

892
00:37:32,747 --> 00:37:34,480
So he tortured them.

893
00:37:34,482 --> 00:37:37,083
I submit he forced them to
log on to Mo's Web site,

894
00:37:37,085 --> 00:37:39,686
and when they failed...

895
00:37:41,323 --> 00:37:42,755
After two murders,

896
00:37:42,757 --> 00:37:44,290
the game was compromised.

897
00:37:44,292 --> 00:37:46,192
So the killer devises
a Plan “B.”

898
00:37:46,194 --> 00:37:47,460
He tricks

899
00:37:47,462 --> 00:37:49,229
a group of his peers

900
00:37:49,231 --> 00:37:51,097
into helping search
for an alternative means

901
00:37:51,099 --> 00:37:53,032
of identifying Mo.

902
00:37:56,504 --> 00:37:58,438
You're talking about that guy.

903
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,906
The one with the penthouse.

904
00:37:59,908 --> 00:38:02,742
<i>Paul?</i>

905
00:38:02,744 --> 00:38:05,044
Lottery winners
are public record.

906
00:38:05,046 --> 00:38:07,814
So when I searched for
the names of repeat winners

907
00:38:07,816 --> 00:38:09,482
in the dates prior
to your posts...

908
00:38:09,484 --> 00:38:11,317
I can't believe
I drank his water.

909
00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:12,685
I called him.

910
00:38:12,687 --> 00:38:14,654
I identified you as Mo.

911
00:38:14,656 --> 00:38:16,122
And I gave him your address.

912
00:38:16,124 --> 00:38:17,590
You what?!

913
00:38:21,129 --> 00:38:23,062
Drop your weapon!

914
00:38:23,064 --> 00:38:24,597
<i>I did not, however, give him</i>

915
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:25,965
<i>the correct apartment number.</i>

916
00:38:25,967 --> 00:38:28,334
He was arrested
a little over an hour ago.

917
00:38:30,739 --> 00:38:31,871
Tried to call you to
tell you, but, um...

918
00:38:31,873 --> 00:38:33,539
But I was ignoring you.

919
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:35,008
Yes, you were ignoring me.

920
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,209
Look, you know

921
00:38:36,211 --> 00:38:37,377
that I'm still screwed, right?

922
00:38:37,379 --> 00:38:39,279
You told him that I'm Mo.

923
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:42,115
He's gonna tell the police,
they're gonna tell the FBI...

924
00:38:42,117 --> 00:38:43,516
The NYPD is under
the impression

925
00:38:43,518 --> 00:38:45,385
that I lied about
your connection to Mo

926
00:38:45,387 --> 00:38:47,920
in order to draw
Mr. Ettinger out.

927
00:38:47,922 --> 00:38:49,555
As far as the
FBI goes, well,

928
00:38:49,557 --> 00:38:51,958
I've got some associates
who have created a trail

929
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,860
which will
strongly suggest that Mo

930
00:38:53,862 --> 00:38:55,728
is a cyber-terrorist
I became aware of

931
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:58,197
whilst working for, um...

932
00:38:58,199 --> 00:38:59,766
queen and country.

933
00:38:59,768 --> 00:39:02,135
Your secret's
quite safe.

934
00:39:02,137 --> 00:39:03,903
Thanks.

935
00:39:06,508 --> 00:39:09,776
My reasons for preserving you
are entirely selfish, Harlan.

936
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:13,279
You are a tremendous asset.

937
00:39:13,281 --> 00:39:15,815
I have little doubt

938
00:39:15,817 --> 00:39:19,118
I will need your help again
in the future.

939
00:39:26,461 --> 00:39:28,528
Me or him?

940
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:29,996
You.

941
00:39:29,998 --> 00:39:31,798
I have an update on
that real estate flipper.

942
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,433
I thought you might
want to know.

943
00:39:39,274 --> 00:39:41,908
I tracked down the truck rental
receipts to get her name.

944
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,142
Valerie Cork.

945
00:39:43,144 --> 00:39:44,911
She's an art authenticator.

946
00:39:44,913 --> 00:39:46,779
And that crate you saw?

947
00:39:46,781 --> 00:39:48,414
There was
something called

948
00:39:48,416 --> 00:39:50,683
a scanning fluorescence
spectrometry machine inside.

949
00:39:50,685 --> 00:39:52,251
They're used...
To find paintings

950
00:39:52,253 --> 00:39:53,553
underneath other paintings.

951
00:39:53,555 --> 00:39:55,288
So it turns out
that the building

952
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:56,689
Chad Keswick was looking to buy

953
00:39:56,691 --> 00:39:59,025
was leased by the WPA
during the Depression.

954
00:39:59,027 --> 00:40:00,927
They commissioned a
mural for the lobby.

955
00:40:00,929 --> 00:40:03,329
The artist was a
notorious communist,

956
00:40:03,331 --> 00:40:05,365
so when the property passed
into private hands in the '50s,

957
00:40:05,367 --> 00:40:06,999
the new owners
had it painted over.

958
00:40:07,001 --> 00:40:08,735
But it was still there,
under the paint.

959
00:40:08,737 --> 00:40:11,037
A lost work by Diego Rivera.

960
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:13,473
It's worth ten times
the price of the building.

961
00:40:14,676 --> 00:40:17,043
I was hoping to leak
the truth to the<i> Times.</i>

962
00:40:18,113 --> 00:40:20,046
I promised you a cut of my fee.

963
00:40:20,048 --> 00:40:22,148
But I'm pretty sure
the mural's gonna end up

964
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:24,384
in the hands of
a historical trust.

965
00:40:24,386 --> 00:40:26,352
I'd feel obligated
to refund my client,

966
00:40:26,354 --> 00:40:28,388
which means you'd get
a cut of nothing.

967
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:31,457
That works for me.

968
00:40:31,459 --> 00:40:33,493
Okay.

969
00:40:35,463 --> 00:40:37,397
I think you should know

970
00:40:37,399 --> 00:40:39,732
that I am going
to a meeting tonight.

971
00:40:41,803 --> 00:40:45,505
One of those
support groups for...

972
00:40:45,507 --> 00:40:47,340
people like me.

973
00:40:47,342 --> 00:40:49,876
It was, uh, Sherlock's idea.

974
00:40:49,878 --> 00:40:51,644
That's great.

975
00:40:51,646 --> 00:40:53,446
I know you put him up to it.

976
00:40:53,448 --> 00:40:55,381
We talked.

977
00:40:57,552 --> 00:41:00,219
When he first approached me
in London,

978
00:41:00,221 --> 00:41:03,556
I was...

979
00:41:03,558 --> 00:41:05,558
in a bad way.

980
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,227
And I had been for a while.

981
00:41:08,229 --> 00:41:11,130
But then,
when he talked about

982
00:41:11,132 --> 00:41:12,365
the work that he did,

983
00:41:12,367 --> 00:41:16,035
about the things
that he saw in me...

984
00:41:18,406 --> 00:41:19,739
I want it.

985
00:41:19,741 --> 00:41:21,874
I want every bit
of what's he offered me,

986
00:41:21,876 --> 00:41:23,843
of what he offered you, but...

987
00:41:23,845 --> 00:41:26,212
if I've learned one thing
over the last few weeks,

988
00:41:26,214 --> 00:41:28,047
it's that he can't pull it off.

989
00:41:28,049 --> 00:41:29,682
Not by himself, anyway.

990
00:41:31,586 --> 00:41:34,153
And if I'm gonna get
what I want,

991
00:41:34,155 --> 00:41:37,690
then I'm going to need
your help, too.

992
00:41:40,361 --> 00:41:42,829
I still think
the meetings are bollocks,

993
00:41:42,831 --> 00:41:44,931
but you say they're important.

994
00:41:44,933 --> 00:41:47,967
They matter to you, so...

995
00:41:47,969 --> 00:41:49,735
What do you say, Watson?

996
00:41:49,737 --> 00:41:52,071
Will you help me?

997
00:41:56,277 --> 00:41:58,244
I don't know how it happened.

998
00:41:58,246 --> 00:42:01,547
It just... hit me.

999
00:42:01,549 --> 00:42:03,983
Like a truck, out of nowhere.

1000
00:42:04,853 --> 00:42:07,753
Work is good.

1001
00:42:07,755 --> 00:42:09,755
I have friends.

1002
00:42:09,757 --> 00:42:13,092
I'm in a
relationship.

1003
00:42:13,094 --> 00:42:16,896
Somewhere along
the way, somehow,

1004
00:42:16,898 --> 00:42:19,732
I stopped being a victim

1005
00:42:19,734 --> 00:42:22,602
and became a survivor.

1006
00:42:22,604 --> 00:42:25,705
So, I guess all I'm saying is,
there's hope.

1007
00:42:26,357 --> 00:42:31,686
Do the work. Love yourself.
There's hope.

If you're looking for Sherlock,
he's downstairs.

3
00:00:04,785 --> 00:00:05,841
Okay.

4
00:00:05,842 --> 00:00:07,541
<i>His name is Harlan Emple.</i>

<i>He is the Rachel P. Hanson</i>
<i>Professor</i>

6

for Applied Mathematics
at Columbia University.

7
00:00:11,301 --> 00:00:14,502
What I don't get is
why he isn't wearing a shirt.

8
00:00:14,504 --> 00:00:17,372
He doesn't like anything to come
between him and the numbers.

9
00:00:17,374 --> 00:00:18,415
What is it?

10
00:00:18,438 --> 00:00:20,274
The answers to your questions
about Kitty.

11
00:00:20,276 --> 00:00:22,710
The truth is she was a
victim of a horrific crime.

12
00:00:22,712 --> 00:00:24,646
<i>After you left last night,</i>

13
00:00:24,648 --> 00:00:26,848
Sherlock gave me an envelope.

14
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,249
Sherlock keeps saying

15
00:00:28,251 --> 00:00:30,385
that I need to get
a better sense of you,

16
00:00:30,387 --> 00:00:33,021
and maybe that will give you
a better sense of me.

17
00:00:42,065 --> 00:00:43,065
It's open.

18
00:00:47,637 --> 00:00:49,003
It's nothing.

19
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:50,872
It's Sherlock and
one of his experts.

20
00:00:50,874 --> 00:00:52,006
Which one?

21
00:00:52,008 --> 00:00:53,241
Phillip something.

22
00:00:53,243 --> 00:00:54,575
Must be new.

23
00:00:54,577 --> 00:00:57,445
He's a knife-thrower.

24
00:00:57,447 --> 00:00:58,913
Why does Sherlock have
a knife-thrower?

25
00:00:58,915 --> 00:01:00,748
He got bored the other day,

26
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,185
started looking into this, uh,
circus accident from the '30s.

27
00:01:04,187 --> 00:01:07,922
The Great Galardo perforated one
of his assistants during an act,

28
00:01:07,924 --> 00:01:09,924
except Sherlock thinks
the blade was thrown

29
00:01:09,926 --> 00:01:11,492
by somebody in the stands,
not Galardo.

30
00:01:11,494 --> 00:01:15,096
Phillip, as far as I
can tell, disagrees.

31
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:18,900
It can't be done, okay?

32
00:01:18,902 --> 00:01:19,934
It was done.

33
00:01:19,936 --> 00:01:21,335
You're wrong.

34
00:01:21,337 --> 00:01:23,538
Nobody can chuck
a knife that far.

35
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,239
What's this?

36
00:01:25,241 --> 00:01:26,207
You're...

37
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:27,209
Not here.

38
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,509
I'm not here.

39
00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:29,711
Remember that, okay?

40
00:01:29,713 --> 00:01:31,279
Oh, yes. Heaven
forfend your work

41
00:01:31,281 --> 00:01:33,247
with me should endanger
your precious day job.

42
00:01:33,249 --> 00:01:35,116
You throw knives?

43
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,252
You know, it was supposed
to be just you here.

44
00:01:38,254 --> 00:01:41,355
Phillip is arguably the greatest
knife-thrower in the world.

45
00:01:41,357 --> 00:01:42,790
Has been for decades.

46
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:43,925
Only, there's little money

47
00:01:43,927 --> 00:01:45,193
to be made
in the impalement arts.

48
00:01:45,195 --> 00:01:46,494
So, as a youth, he turned

49
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,563
to what you Americans
term “football”"

50
00:01:48,565 --> 00:01:50,131
Is this a joke?

51
00:01:53,837 --> 00:01:55,002
Phillip, head
and heart.

52
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:56,904
Come on.
Head and heart.

53
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:06,814
Can I go?

54
00:02:06,816 --> 00:02:09,484
Yeah.

55
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,489
15 years he spent throwing
that misshapen ball around.

56
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:16,057
15 years.

57
00:02:16,059 --> 00:02:18,259
When I think of the acclaim
he could have brought

58
00:02:18,261 --> 00:02:20,828
to competitive blade slinging.

59
00:02:27,237 --> 00:02:29,036
You're following me,
Watson.

60
00:02:29,038 --> 00:02:30,338
I don't like it.

61
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,740
I want you to help
me with something.

62
00:02:32,742 --> 00:02:33,908
This is Chad Keswick.

63
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,976
He buys distressed
buildings,

64
00:02:34,978 --> 00:02:36,210
paints, spackles,

65
00:02:36,212 --> 00:02:37,645
and then flips them
for quick money.

66
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:39,180
Who'd he kill?
No one.

67
00:02:39,182 --> 00:02:41,315
I was hired by one of
his rivals to find out

68
00:02:41,317 --> 00:02:43,017
why he's been circling
this old office building

69
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:44,218
in Jamaica, Queens.

70
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,586
She wants to know
why he thinks

71
00:02:45,588 --> 00:02:47,355
the building is
a good investment.

72
00:02:47,357 --> 00:02:49,590
Is there a crime in there,
something worth investigating?

73
00:02:49,592 --> 00:02:50,925
Well, I've been
shadowing Keswick,

74
00:02:50,927 --> 00:02:52,593
but yesterday I think
he noticed me.

75
00:02:52,595 --> 00:02:54,595
I want to switch
up the tail.

76
00:02:54,597 --> 00:02:57,231
You followed me for over
a week before I noticed you.

77
00:02:57,233 --> 00:02:59,033
Help me out, and I'll
cut you in on my fee.

78
00:02:59,035 --> 00:03:02,003
I don't work for you,
I work for Sherlock.

79
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:03,437
I worked for him, too.

80
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,773
And, in my experience,
he was always supportive

81
00:03:05,775 --> 00:03:07,942
of taking on work
outside the partnership.

82
00:03:07,944 --> 00:03:10,912
Sorry, it's not my cup of tea.

One dead guy

I am the one who called 911.

I was waiting there

100
00:05:08,312 --> 00:05:09,745
Mr. Emple,

101
00:05:09,747 --> 00:05:11,613
we're just trying
to do our jobs, all right?

102
00:05:11,615 --> 00:05:13,048
First officers
on the scene described you

103
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,516
as “extremely agitated.”

104
00:05:14,518 --> 00:05:15,984
Well, of course
I was agitated.

105
00:05:15,986 --> 00:05:18,754
I had just found
a dead guy in mothballs!

106
00:05:18,756 --> 00:05:21,790
And did I mention that I have
not slept in almost two days?

107
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:23,358
Because of the math game.

108
00:05:24,762 --> 00:05:26,195
Can I borrow those?

109
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:31,100
This...

110
00:05:31,102 --> 00:05:33,302
is Belphegor's Prime, okay?

111
00:05:33,304 --> 00:05:35,304
It's a numeric palindrome.

112
00:05:35,306 --> 00:05:40,776
It's 666 bookended by 13 zeroes
and then bracketed with ones.

113
00:05:40,778 --> 00:05:43,846
Named for the demon Belphegor
who was a prince of hell.

114
00:05:43,848 --> 00:05:46,448
The first clue for the hunt
started making the rounds

115
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,883
a few months ago.

116
00:05:47,885 --> 00:05:49,651
It was a JPEG with two numbers
hidden in it.

117
00:05:49,653 --> 00:05:51,453
You divide those numbers
by Belphegor's Prime,

118
00:05:51,455 --> 00:05:54,890
and you get the GPS coordinates
for a restroom at the Bronx Zoo.

119
00:05:54,892 --> 00:05:56,959
You go to the restroom,
you find a phone number.

120
00:05:56,961 --> 00:05:58,927
You send a text to the number,
you get the next clue.

121
00:05:58,929 --> 00:05:59,962
Which is another math problem.

122
00:05:59,964 --> 00:06:00,929
Exactly.

123
00:06:00,931 --> 00:06:02,397
Only, this one is harder.

124
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,099
And that's how it works.

125
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:05,934
You know, but for
each one that you solve,

126
00:06:05,936 --> 00:06:08,103
you get a new set
of GPS coordinates.

127
00:06:08,105 --> 00:06:11,473
And that means that you've
completed a stage, or a portal.

128
00:06:11,475 --> 00:06:13,509
And last night,
I was on Portal Ten.

129
00:06:13,511 --> 00:06:15,711
And...

130
00:06:17,014 --> 00:06:18,313
You know what?

131
00:06:18,315 --> 00:06:20,015
I want to talk
to Sherlock and Joan.

132
00:06:20,017 --> 00:06:21,917
Look, Mr. Emple...
No, I'm sorry.

133
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,019
I told the police down
at the factory that I know them.

134
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:25,287
Isn't that the whole reason

135
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:26,922
that I was brought here
to this squad?

136
00:06:26,924 --> 00:06:30,392
I-I am not saying another word
until they are here.

137
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:35,264
Harlan Emple is
indeed an acquaintance.

138
00:06:35,266 --> 00:06:37,733
He is, in point of fact,
one of my “irregulars.”

139
00:06:37,735 --> 00:06:38,801
One of your what?

140
00:06:38,803 --> 00:06:40,302
Irregulars.

141
00:06:40,304 --> 00:06:41,770
I'm your consultant, Captain;
they are mine.

142
00:06:41,772 --> 00:06:43,572
They're a handful
of experts I turn to

143
00:06:43,574 --> 00:06:46,108
when I encounter problems which
are beyond my pool of knowledge.

144
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,810
Harlan is
a brilliant mathematician.

145
00:06:47,812 --> 00:06:49,778
And on the handful of occasions
I have tackled a case

146
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,046
which pertained
to mathematics...

147
00:06:51,048 --> 00:06:53,182
He helped you out.
Well, the good news

148
00:06:53,184 --> 00:06:56,018
for him is the preliminary
autopsy report just came in

149
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,252
before you got here.

150
00:06:57,254 --> 00:06:59,021
And the M.E. puts
the time of death

151
00:06:59,023 --> 00:07:00,989
between 4:00 and
6:00 p.m. last night.

152
00:07:00,991 --> 00:07:02,124
Mr. Emple was teaching

153
00:07:02,126 --> 00:07:03,358
a class at Columbia.

154
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,394
So the victim is
yet to be identified?

155
00:07:05,396 --> 00:07:07,663
No I.D., no phone.

156
00:07:07,665 --> 00:07:09,865
First detective on the scene
liked it for a mob hit,

157
00:07:09,867 --> 00:07:11,500
so while we're
running the prints,

158
00:07:11,502 --> 00:07:13,602
he's showing the vic's
face around OCID.

159
00:07:13,604 --> 00:07:16,839
Marcus here was about to walk
the scene with Mr. Emple.

160
00:07:16,841 --> 00:07:18,774
You're here now;
you might as well tag along.

161
00:07:18,776 --> 00:07:21,009
Actually, Captain,
I'm quite busy today.

162
00:07:21,011 --> 00:07:22,978
This is a John Doe,
and we got nothing.

163
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,247
And, like you just said,
you're my consultant.

164
00:07:25,249 --> 00:07:26,748
So, go consult.

165
00:07:29,787 --> 00:07:30,986
Watson.

166
00:07:30,988 --> 00:07:32,588
Um, he's your friend.

167
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,523
Actually, Kitty is
otherwise engaged,

168
00:07:34,525 --> 00:07:37,426
and he did actually help both
of us with a case last year.

169
00:07:37,428 --> 00:07:38,493
Did he not?

170
00:07:40,865 --> 00:07:44,099
Have I told you
how good it is to see you?

171
00:07:44,101 --> 00:07:45,367
Yes, you have.
Three times.

172
00:07:45,369 --> 00:07:46,468
Well, it is.

173
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,636
Hey, lousy circumstances.

174
00:07:47,638 --> 00:07:49,371
But, uh, hey...

175
00:07:49,373 --> 00:07:51,740
I heard from your boss that you
just, uh, got back from London.

176
00:07:51,742 --> 00:07:53,308
Were you working
a case or...?

177
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,576
No, I moved back there.

178
00:07:54,578 --> 00:07:55,677
You mean<i> moved,</i> moved?

179
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:56,845
Is there another
definition?

180
00:07:56,847 --> 00:07:58,513
I was there for
eight months,

181
00:07:58,515 --> 00:08:00,883
and had a change of heart
and returned to New York.

182
00:08:00,885 --> 00:08:02,517
So, you moved to London,
and you didn't, uh...

183
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,086
You know what?
Doesn't even matter.

184
00:08:04,088 --> 00:08:05,387
The point is you're back!

185
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:07,389
Mr. Emple.
Uh, duty calls.

186
00:08:07,391 --> 00:08:09,024
Yeah.

187
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:18,634
It's interesting.

188
00:08:18,636 --> 00:08:20,068
Mothballs are interesting?

189
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,070
They were taken from
that cabinet over there.

190
00:08:22,072 --> 00:08:25,941
Obviously, to cover the smell
of John Doe's decay.

191
00:08:25,943 --> 00:08:28,043
The killer didn't
bring them with him.

192
00:08:28,045 --> 00:08:31,179
Perhaps leaving the body here
was not part of his plan, hmm?

193
00:08:32,983 --> 00:08:36,018
Doe was shot in the foot
first and then the knee.

194
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,453
Either those were
two really bad misses or...

195
00:08:38,455 --> 00:08:41,256
Or the killer was torturing him.

196
00:08:41,258 --> 00:08:43,892
This doesn't seem like anything
you can't handle on your own.

197
00:08:43,894 --> 00:08:45,994
So you want to tell me why you
really asked me to come here?

198
00:08:45,996 --> 00:08:48,363
“This doesn't seem like anything
you can't handle on your own.”

199
00:08:48,365 --> 00:08:49,765
That's funny.

200
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:51,566
That's exactly what
I would have said

201
00:08:51,568 --> 00:08:53,602
had I been present when you
asked Kitty for her assistance

202
00:08:53,604 --> 00:08:54,937
with your tawdry side job.

203
00:08:54,939 --> 00:08:57,372
“Tawdry”?
I wanted you to know I approve.

204
00:08:57,374 --> 00:08:59,007
Of what?

205
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:01,376
Your agenda
with regards to Kitty.

206
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:03,078
Several days ago,
I gave you her file.

207
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,913
And then you show up at
the brownstone yesterday,

208
00:09:04,915 --> 00:09:06,515
and you invite her
into an investigation.

209
00:09:06,517 --> 00:09:08,183
Coincidence? No, I think not.

210
00:09:08,185 --> 00:09:11,320
You feel for her.
And now you wish to engage.

211
00:09:11,322 --> 00:09:13,956
It's not an outcome
I would have predicted, no.

212
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,458
But it is one
I approve of, yeah.

213
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,193
She could learn
a great deal from you,

214
00:09:18,195 --> 00:09:20,228
especially with regards
to how to get the most

215
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,864
from my tutelage.

216
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:25,734
So, I've already dispatched her
to, uh, follow your Mr. Keswick.

217
00:09:25,736 --> 00:09:27,836
But that's not
what I actually...

218
00:09:27,838 --> 00:09:29,404
Harlan!

219
00:09:30,741 --> 00:09:33,075
You came here to retrieve
a phone number, did you not?

220
00:09:33,077 --> 00:09:34,609
You would send a text,
and then receive

221
00:09:34,611 --> 00:09:36,845
the next clue in the game
that you were playing.

222
00:09:36,847 --> 00:09:38,747
Yeah, but I didn't find it.

223
00:09:38,749 --> 00:09:40,048
Not that I kept looking

224
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,250
after the dead guy
fell out of the locker.

225
00:09:42,252 --> 00:09:44,052
Yeah, CSU didn't find
any number either.

226
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:46,154
Probably because
it's under that paint.

227
00:09:46,156 --> 00:09:48,190
It's fresh.

228
00:09:48,192 --> 00:09:49,891
Applied in the last

229
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:52,694
24 hours.

230
00:09:52,696 --> 00:09:54,696
Right after John Doe's murder,
I'd wager.

231
00:09:54,698 --> 00:09:57,099
You don't think
this was a mob hit?

232
00:09:57,101 --> 00:09:59,101
Doe and the killer were
playing the game, too.

233
00:09:59,103 --> 00:10:01,203
The killer shot Doe and
then covered up the number

234
00:10:01,205 --> 00:10:02,704
so no one else could use it.

235
00:10:02,706 --> 00:10:04,806
What's the prize
in your little contest?

236
00:10:04,808 --> 00:10:07,576
Well, I'm doing it
mostly for the math.

237
00:10:07,578 --> 00:10:11,480
But, uh, $1,707,071.

238
00:10:11,482 --> 00:10:13,882
It's another
palindromic prime.

239
00:10:13,884 --> 00:10:17,152
Did I not mention the
money at the station?

240
00:10:17,154 --> 00:10:18,587
Who the hell can afford

241
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:20,655
that kind of payout
for a puzzle hunt?

242
00:10:20,657 --> 00:10:22,124
Well, most people
think it's CAML.

243
00:10:22,126 --> 00:10:24,593
The Center for Applied
Mathematics and Logic.

244
00:10:24,595 --> 00:10:26,094
It's located
in Ramapo...

245
00:10:26,096 --> 00:10:27,729
Wait, most people
“think” it's them?

246
00:10:27,731 --> 00:10:29,331
Well, hunts like these,

247
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,266
the organizers are
almost always anonymous.

248
00:10:31,268 --> 00:10:32,401
It's S.O.P.

249
00:10:32,403 --> 00:10:34,302
What about the
contestants?

250
00:10:34,304 --> 00:10:37,005
Is anonymity
also S.O.P.?

251
00:10:37,007 --> 00:10:39,207
For the most part, yeah.

252
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:43,078
But, guys, math peeps
are my peeps, okay?

253
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,314
It's, uh, like
a community, sort of.

254
00:10:46,316 --> 00:10:48,984
I can think of ten
or 12 other people

255
00:10:48,986 --> 00:10:50,018
who were probably competing.

256
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,186
Would that help?

257
00:10:53,157 --> 00:10:55,223
No.

258
00:10:55,225 --> 00:10:58,026
I'm sorry, I don't know him.

259
00:10:58,028 --> 00:11:00,862
But you admit you were
competing in Belphegor's Prime.

260
00:11:00,864 --> 00:11:02,197
I do.

261
00:11:04,835 --> 00:11:05,934
Pepe!

262
00:11:08,172 --> 00:11:10,439
Sorry. He doesn't
like strangers.

263
00:11:12,109 --> 00:11:14,443
Give him one of these.

264
00:11:14,445 --> 00:11:16,111
Get on his good side.

265
00:11:24,288 --> 00:11:26,354
What are you doing?

266
00:11:28,225 --> 00:11:30,725
I'm just verifying that
you've been lying to us.

267
00:11:30,727 --> 00:11:33,895
You did know the
dead man, did you not?

268
00:11:33,897 --> 00:11:36,998
I reviewed his personal
effects at the morgue earlier.

269
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,034
The coroner reported finding
crumbs in one of his pockets.

270
00:11:39,036 --> 00:11:40,036
I tasted one.

271
00:11:40,037 --> 00:11:41,269
Why would you...?

272
00:11:41,271 --> 00:11:42,771
At first, I thought
they were from

273
00:11:42,773 --> 00:11:44,439
a particularly rancid
brand of cheese,

274
00:11:44,441 --> 00:11:47,609
but, no... they're from
one of Pepe's treats.

275
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:49,277
Homemade?

276
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,481
Harlan was able to give us
the names of nine other people

277
00:11:52,483 --> 00:11:54,149
he believed to be
other competitors.

278
00:11:54,151 --> 00:11:55,984
Our colleagues are
investigating them as we speak,

279
00:11:55,986 --> 00:11:57,919
but I'll quite happily
recommend that the NYPD

280
00:11:57,921 --> 00:12:00,222
focus its attention
entirely on you.

281
00:12:04,128 --> 00:12:06,428
His name was Ike Walaczek.

282
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,231
In another lifetime,
he was my boyfriend.

283
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:10,866
And what of
this lifetime?

284
00:12:10,868 --> 00:12:12,701
We were working together.

285
00:12:12,703 --> 00:12:14,769
On Belphegor's.
What?!

286
00:12:14,771 --> 00:12:16,705
He was a numerical analyst
at the Tory Foundation.

287
00:12:16,707 --> 00:12:17,873
I work mostly in combinatorics.

288
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,307
I thought we would make
a good team.

289
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:20,742
But there aren't
supposed to be teams.

290
00:12:20,744 --> 00:12:22,711
Not in a puzzle hunt.
It's bad form.

291
00:12:22,713 --> 00:12:23,713
Harlan...

292
00:12:23,714 --> 00:12:25,514
I'm just saying...

293
00:12:25,516 --> 00:12:27,315
My husband
wouldn't understand,

294
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:30,385
so I decided I wouldn't tell him
until after we won the money.

295
00:12:30,387 --> 00:12:33,121
A team-- so that's how
you got there before me.

296
00:12:33,123 --> 00:12:34,489
I wasn't there.

297
00:12:34,491 --> 00:12:36,258
Tom and I were out of town
until this morning.

298
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,126
His cousin
was getting married in Hawaii.

299
00:12:38,128 --> 00:12:40,662
That's why Ike went
to the coordinates by himself.

300
00:12:40,664 --> 00:12:42,097
Because I couldn't.

301
00:12:44,268 --> 00:12:46,601
These are pictures I took.

302
00:12:46,603 --> 00:12:49,337
Check the dates.

303
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:51,506
You gave the police
nine other names?

304
00:12:51,508 --> 00:12:53,408
People you thought
were competing?

305
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,776
I've got 16.

306
00:12:54,778 --> 00:12:56,311
And I know they were competing.

307
00:12:58,448 --> 00:13:01,249
He talked to her
outside the Jamaica property

308
00:13:01,251 --> 00:13:05,720
for about 20 minutes,
and then this truck rolled up.

309
00:13:05,722 --> 00:13:07,822
Any idea what's
inside the crate?

310
00:13:07,824 --> 00:13:09,024
Nope.

311
00:13:09,026 --> 00:13:10,392
I can't identify
the woman either.

312
00:13:10,394 --> 00:13:12,260
Everything about her
said money though.

313
00:13:12,262 --> 00:13:15,363
She, Keswick
and the mystery box

314
00:13:15,365 --> 00:13:17,732
stayed inside the building
for about three hours,

315
00:13:17,734 --> 00:13:20,001
and then off they went.

316
00:13:20,904 --> 00:13:22,170
Good.

317
00:13:22,172 --> 00:13:23,872
Okay.

318
00:13:23,874 --> 00:13:26,074
You know where
to send the check.

319
00:13:26,076 --> 00:13:30,145
You haven't asked me about
the file Sherlock gave me.

320
00:13:30,147 --> 00:13:32,080
Why would I?

321
00:13:32,082 --> 00:13:36,184
You said it would give me
a better sense of you-- it did.

322
00:13:37,588 --> 00:13:40,155
That's why you asked
for my help.

323
00:13:40,157 --> 00:13:41,990
Because you felt sorry for me.

324
00:13:41,992 --> 00:13:44,226
No.

325
00:13:44,228 --> 00:13:46,194
You just don't seem interested
in anything

326
00:13:46,196 --> 00:13:48,063
outside of becoming
a detective.

327
00:13:48,065 --> 00:13:50,999
There she is.

328
00:13:51,001 --> 00:13:53,301
The old counselor.

329
00:13:53,303 --> 00:13:55,637
Who used to hold
Sherlock's hand.

330
00:13:57,608 --> 00:13:59,741
Everything that you read,

331
00:13:59,743 --> 00:14:02,510
everything that happened to me,
that's all it is.

332
00:14:02,512 --> 00:14:04,646
It's just something
that happened.

333
00:14:04,648 --> 00:14:08,116
And it's all
in the past now.

334
00:14:08,118 --> 00:14:10,685
So let's just
leave it there, shall we?

335
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:24,667
Hello.

336
00:14:24,668 --> 00:14:26,001
You've had sex.

337
00:14:26,003 --> 00:14:27,202
Excuse me?

338
00:14:27,204 --> 00:14:28,503
I can hear it
in your voice.

339
00:14:28,505 --> 00:14:29,771
You've joined paunches.

340
00:14:29,773 --> 00:14:30,972
Good for you, Watson.

341
00:14:30,974 --> 00:14:32,807
As you know, I think
the act of love

342
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:34,676
can be quite conducive to...
What do you want?

343
00:14:34,678 --> 00:14:36,911
Merely to apprise you
of a new development

344
00:14:36,913 --> 00:14:38,280
in the murder of
Ike Walaczek.

345
00:14:38,282 --> 00:14:40,115
As I informed
you yesterday,

346
00:14:40,117 --> 00:14:42,284
Harlan and I were given
a new list of competitors.

347
00:14:42,286 --> 00:14:45,320
One name leapt out:
Byron Lowenthal.

348
00:14:45,322 --> 00:14:48,156
He's a statistician at the
Public Utilities Commission

349
00:14:48,158 --> 00:14:50,425
and a diagnosed
paranoid schizophrenic.

350
00:14:50,427 --> 00:14:52,160
He's been hospitalized
for becoming violent

351
00:14:52,162 --> 00:14:53,728
on no fewer
than three occasions.

352
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,964
Certainly sounds like
it could be our guy.

353
00:14:55,966 --> 00:14:59,367
Unfortunately, Mr. Lowenthal had
another break earlier this year.

354
00:14:59,369 --> 00:15:02,137
He's been staying in
a transient hotel ever since.

355
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:04,239
Detective Bell and I
are going to speak with him.

356
00:15:04,241 --> 00:15:05,307
You want me to meet you?

357
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:06,875
Oh, no, we're already here.

358
00:15:06,877 --> 00:15:08,410
Anyway, now that I know
that you've enjoyed coitus

359
00:15:08,412 --> 00:15:09,778
and could enjoy more
in the near future...

360
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,846
When you're done,
we need to talk.

361
00:15:14,718 --> 00:15:16,818
Byron Lowenthal,
you in there?

362
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,053
Who is it?

363
00:15:18,055 --> 00:15:19,754
It's Detective Bell, NYPD.

364
00:15:19,756 --> 00:15:22,257
My colleague and I would like
to ask you some questions.

365
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:24,592
Let me
get some pants on.

366
00:15:37,341 --> 00:15:40,008
S-Sorry, I just... I, um...

367
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,310
I-I thought I heard
Mr. Lowenthal retr...

368
00:16:19,154 --> 00:16:21,267
You guys got lucky.

369
00:16:21,268 --> 00:16:22,868
Well, luck had little
to do with it, actually.

370
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,536
I... I heard Mr. Lowenthal

371
00:16:24,538 --> 00:16:27,039
pulling a heavy object off
a shelf, placing it on his bed,

372
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,041
and the sound of
the zipper indicated

373
00:16:29,043 --> 00:16:30,976
that it was
a large gun case.

374
00:16:30,978 --> 00:16:33,579
Looks like he was sane enough
to do math, but not much else.

375
00:16:33,581 --> 00:16:34,747
Plus, he was
pretty hopped up.

376
00:16:34,749 --> 00:16:36,448
Caffeine pills,
energy drinks,

377
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,251
pretty much every legal
stimulant you can buy.

378
00:16:39,253 --> 00:16:40,853
Plus a few illegal ones.

379
00:16:40,855 --> 00:16:42,821
Hmm. Obviously, he was
keeping himself awake

380
00:16:42,823 --> 00:16:44,490
so he could work on
Belphegor's.

381
00:16:44,492 --> 00:16:47,392
This... is obvious to you?

382
00:16:47,394 --> 00:16:48,961
I confess the maths
are beyond me,

383
00:16:48,963 --> 00:16:51,130
but I took the liberty of
sending pictures of what

384
00:16:51,132 --> 00:16:52,865
appear to be Mr. Lowenthal's
most recent scribbles

385
00:16:52,867 --> 00:16:54,166
to Harlan Emple,
and he's confirmed

386
00:16:54,168 --> 00:16:55,667
they are part of the contest.

387
00:16:55,669 --> 00:16:56,969
With your permission,
I'd like copies of these

388
00:16:56,971 --> 00:16:58,837
sent to my home
so he can review them.

389
00:16:58,839 --> 00:16:59,972
What for?

390
00:16:59,974 --> 00:17:01,073
If Byron Lowenthal

391
00:17:01,075 --> 00:17:02,441
did kill Ike Walaczek,

392
00:17:02,443 --> 00:17:04,109
then he used
and obscured a phone number,

393
00:17:04,111 --> 00:17:05,878
which would have yielded
the next problem.

394
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,379
That problem's solution

395
00:17:07,381 --> 00:17:08,714
would be GPS coordinates.

396
00:17:08,716 --> 00:17:10,415
If he's recorded them
in his books...

397
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:12,551
Your pal will be able to tell us
where he's headed next.

398
00:17:12,553 --> 00:17:14,853
I'll get our guys to give you

399
00:17:14,855 --> 00:17:16,388
whatever you need.

400
00:17:17,258 --> 00:17:18,991
Scans are still coming through,

401
00:17:18,993 --> 00:17:21,260
but I've put what we've got
so far up on the wall.

402
00:17:21,262 --> 00:17:23,262
Sherlock said that
you prefer it that way.

403
00:17:23,264 --> 00:17:25,030
Picked it up from him,
actually.

404
00:17:25,032 --> 00:17:28,600
Makes me feel like I'm really
inside of the problem.

405
00:17:30,704 --> 00:17:33,372
I'll, uh, let you know
if I need anything.

406
00:17:34,275 --> 00:17:35,974
Oh, I work without a shirt.

407
00:17:35,976 --> 00:17:38,911
Sometimes makes me feel
closer to the numbers.

408
00:17:38,913 --> 00:17:42,147
You'll need to, uh,
check the printer in the study

409
00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:43,615
for more pages.

410
00:17:43,617 --> 00:17:45,417
Uh, this is nice,
you know?

411
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:47,452
Meeting another member
of the team.

412
00:17:47,454 --> 00:17:48,654
You know, Team Sherlock.

413
00:17:48,656 --> 00:17:50,656
You help him, I help him...

414
00:17:51,926 --> 00:17:53,559
Obviously, you haven't
tackled a case

415
00:17:53,561 --> 00:17:55,093
with high-order math since
you started working with him,

416
00:17:55,095 --> 00:17:57,729
or we would've...

417
00:17:57,731 --> 00:17:59,031
What?

418
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:00,232
What?

419
00:18:00,234 --> 00:18:01,834
Wait...

420
00:18:01,836 --> 00:18:04,002
have you worked a case
with high-order math?

421
00:18:04,805 --> 00:18:06,238
You have, haven't you?

422
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,840
Does it matter?

423
00:18:07,842 --> 00:18:09,842
Of course it...

424
00:18:09,844 --> 00:18:11,443
Oh, my God.

425
00:18:11,445 --> 00:18:13,278
Did he fire me?

426
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,980
All I know
is that back in London,

427
00:18:14,982 --> 00:18:16,982
we worked a case that involved
Fibonacci spirals...

428
00:18:16,984 --> 00:18:18,483
He fired me.

429
00:18:18,485 --> 00:18:21,386
...and he called some woman
named Indira Patel.

430
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,856
She's at Berkeley.

431
00:18:23,858 --> 00:18:25,624
I'm three time zones closer!

432
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:27,125
You're here now.

433
00:18:27,127 --> 00:18:29,428
Sure, because I found
a dead body.

434
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,531
I have to go; I have to run
some errands for Sherlock.

435
00:18:35,936 --> 00:18:37,903
I-I don't know
what was in the crate,

436
00:18:37,905 --> 00:18:39,271
but the stenciling on
the side indicates

437
00:18:39,273 --> 00:18:40,772
it came from one of
the SUNY schools.

438
00:18:40,774 --> 00:18:42,908
I put another detective
on Keswick...

439
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:45,177
Don't kill me, I had to
use your razor to shave.

440
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:47,179
I...

441
00:18:47,181 --> 00:18:49,147
You must be Andrew.

442
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:50,515
Sherlock Holmes.

443
00:18:50,517 --> 00:18:52,551
Sorry.

444
00:18:52,553 --> 00:18:55,487
Joan said you were coming;
I... I forgot.

445
00:18:55,489 --> 00:18:57,122
It's not how
I wanted to meet you.

446
00:18:57,124 --> 00:18:58,891
She said you can tell
a lot about people

447
00:18:58,893 --> 00:19:00,192
just by looking at them.

448
00:19:00,194 --> 00:19:02,261
I swear, I...
usually wear pants.

449
00:19:02,263 --> 00:19:03,729
Well, in my experience,
most people

450
00:19:03,731 --> 00:19:05,264
need only be concerned
I won't notice

451
00:19:05,266 --> 00:19:06,498
anything worth remarking upon.

452
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:10,535
Watson seems adequately sexed.

453
00:19:11,939 --> 00:19:13,672
Hey.

454
00:19:13,674 --> 00:19:15,674
I was just introducing myself.

455
00:19:17,945 --> 00:19:20,379
I've got that thing.
I'll see you tonight.

456
00:19:20,381 --> 00:19:21,580
Okay.

457
00:19:27,855 --> 00:19:30,188
Your home, Watson...

458
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,823
it's utterly pleasant.

459
00:19:31,825 --> 00:19:33,692
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

460
00:19:33,694 --> 00:19:35,394
When you told me
you wanted a life of your own,

461
00:19:35,396 --> 00:19:36,595
I didn't realize
that you meant you wanted

462
00:19:36,597 --> 00:19:38,030
the same life everyone else has.

463
00:19:38,032 --> 00:19:39,464
But at any rate,
none of my business, is it?

464
00:19:39,466 --> 00:19:41,233
It's not.
And I didn't ask you here

465
00:19:41,235 --> 00:19:42,634
to talk about my apartment.

466
00:19:42,636 --> 00:19:44,970
No, you asked me here
to discuss Kitty.

467
00:19:44,972 --> 00:19:46,471
If she were not
the topic of conversation,

468
00:19:46,473 --> 00:19:48,941
then you wouldn't have
invited me to your home,

469
00:19:48,943 --> 00:19:50,776
where there's no chance
she'll be present.

470
00:19:52,346 --> 00:19:53,946
She disappointed you
in some way.

471
00:19:53,948 --> 00:19:55,247
Skills not up to snuff?

472
00:19:55,249 --> 00:19:57,316
Please remember
she is a novice.

473
00:19:57,318 --> 00:19:58,850
Actually, she did a great job.

474
00:19:58,852 --> 00:20:00,285
But I have some concerns.

475
00:20:00,287 --> 00:20:01,954
I thought we could
talk about them.

476
00:20:03,757 --> 00:20:04,923
You think that
Kitty needs help

477
00:20:04,925 --> 00:20:06,091
above and beyond
my mentorship.

478
00:20:06,093 --> 00:20:07,392
You read the same
file I did.

479
00:20:07,394 --> 00:20:08,894
She's a rape victim.

480
00:20:08,896 --> 00:20:11,296
She was kept and tortured.

481
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,899
Mm.

482
00:20:16,136 --> 00:20:19,171
You know me, so surely you know

483
00:20:19,173 --> 00:20:22,874
I've broached the subject of
a support group meeting before.

484
00:20:22,876 --> 00:20:25,010
Even offered
to pay for therapy.

485
00:20:25,012 --> 00:20:26,812
She's not interested, I know.

486
00:20:26,814 --> 00:20:28,447
Just as you also know

487
00:20:28,449 --> 00:20:30,749
someone with a problem
can't be forced to get help.

488
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:32,551
They have to want it.

489
00:20:32,553 --> 00:20:34,786
What Kitty wants
is to be a detective.

490
00:20:36,523 --> 00:20:38,490
I am taking pains
to try and channel

491
00:20:38,492 --> 00:20:40,592
her residual feelings
into her work.

492
00:20:42,329 --> 00:20:44,463
Well, that works out
great for you.

493
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:48,400
You told me that
you took on a partner

494
00:20:48,402 --> 00:20:50,635
because you wanted to replicate
what you and I had.

495
00:20:50,637 --> 00:20:52,637
That you thought it helped
with your recovery.

496
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:54,539
You think I would
try and take advantage

497
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,208
of the victim of a trauma?

498
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,910
Of course not, but there is
a conflict of interest here.

499
00:20:58,912 --> 00:21:02,447
She needs what she needs,
but you need what you need, too.

500
00:21:06,053 --> 00:21:10,055
It's-it's good that you're
in her life now, Watson.

501
00:21:10,057 --> 00:21:12,524
I mean,
it's commonly believed that, um,

502
00:21:12,526 --> 00:21:16,228
a child benefits mostly from
the presence of two parents.

503
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,164
He-- or she, in this case--
can absorb certain qualities

504
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,466
from the father--
clear-eyed view of the world,

505
00:21:21,468 --> 00:21:23,168
capacity of
rational thought, etcetera.

506
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,170
They can also absorb certain
qualities from the mother.

507
00:21:25,172 --> 00:21:27,105
Excuse me, but I am not
Kitty's mother,

508
00:21:27,107 --> 00:21:28,807
and she sure as hell
is not our child.

509
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:30,942
You brought her here;
she looks up to you.

510
00:21:30,944 --> 00:21:32,944
She says that she doesn't
need help-- fine--

511
00:21:32,946 --> 00:21:34,579
but you know better.

512
00:21:34,581 --> 00:21:37,082
And you're gonna have to be
the one that tells her.

513
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,620
It's Harlan.

514
00:21:41,622 --> 00:21:44,523
Making progress with the maths.

515
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,660
We thought
that Byron and Ike

516
00:21:48,662 --> 00:21:50,462
arrived at Portal Ten
simultaneously.

517
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,664
That would've meant that they
were doing all the same math

518
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,032
at essentially
the same time.

519
00:21:54,034 --> 00:21:56,001
Only, the math
you found at Byron's place

520
00:21:56,003 --> 00:21:57,003
says that's wrong.

521
00:21:57,004 --> 00:21:58,470
He was one step behind Ike.

522
00:21:58,472 --> 00:22:00,705
Are you proposing he did
not kill Mr. Walaczek?

523
00:22:00,707 --> 00:22:03,175
I don't know, but that's
not the weirdest part.

524
00:22:03,177 --> 00:22:04,810
Byron was obsessive.

525
00:22:04,812 --> 00:22:06,211
He time-stamped
almost everything he did.

526
00:22:06,213 --> 00:22:09,047
He only solved
the Portal Nine problem,

527
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:11,316
the same problem that sent me
to that old factory last night.

528
00:22:11,318 --> 00:22:12,884
But get this--

529
00:22:12,886 --> 00:22:14,686
he wasn't given
the same problem as me.

530
00:22:14,688 --> 00:22:16,655
And so it would've yielded
GPS coordinates

531
00:22:16,657 --> 00:22:18,323
for an entirely
different location.

532
00:22:18,325 --> 00:22:21,760
The person in charge of
the game changed the clue

533
00:22:21,762 --> 00:22:23,328
after the police
found Ike's body.

534
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:25,964
Well, he had to, right?

535
00:22:25,966 --> 00:22:27,899
If he hadn't, he would be
sending other competitors

536
00:22:27,901 --> 00:22:29,101
to an active crime scene.

537
00:22:29,103 --> 00:22:30,402
The important thing is

538
00:22:30,404 --> 00:22:31,536
I figured out the coordinates

539
00:22:31,538 --> 00:22:32,771
to the second location.

540
00:22:32,773 --> 00:22:35,540
I know where Byron went.

541
00:22:35,542 --> 00:22:36,842
What are you doing?

542
00:22:36,844 --> 00:22:38,410
You're saying he
time-stamped everything.

543
00:22:38,412 --> 00:22:40,345
I'm looking at the time
he received his clues.

544
00:22:40,347 --> 00:22:42,647
It's all there, to the second,
but what does that have to do...

545
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:44,149
What if you hadn't
found a body?

546
00:22:44,151 --> 00:22:46,118
If the game had
proceeded as planned,

547
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,486
what were you meant
to do there?

548
00:22:47,488 --> 00:22:49,354
I would have sent a text
to the phone number,

549
00:22:49,356 --> 00:22:51,523
the one that the killer painted
over, and then I would have

550
00:22:51,525 --> 00:22:52,891
gotten a message back
with the next problem.

551
00:22:52,893 --> 00:22:54,559
There's an extra
step in there.

552
00:22:54,561 --> 00:22:56,428
Why all this rigmarole with
phone numbers and texts?

553
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,064
Why not just post the problem
itself at the factory?

554
00:22:59,066 --> 00:23:02,100
I don't know, it's just the way
the game is played.

555
00:23:02,102 --> 00:23:04,102
They're for an old
industrial area in Queens.

556
00:23:04,104 --> 00:23:06,805
You're welcome
for finding your suspect.

557
00:23:06,807 --> 00:23:09,207
If I'm right, Harlan,
what you've found...

558
00:23:09,209 --> 00:23:11,109
is the site of
another murder.

559
00:23:11,111 --> 00:23:13,245
Byron Lowenthal's.

560
00:23:15,983 --> 00:23:18,216
You were right,
Lowenthal's dead.

561
00:23:18,218 --> 00:23:20,952
He was shot in the foot,
then the knee.

562
00:23:20,954 --> 00:23:22,821
Just like
Ike Wallaczek.

563
00:23:22,823 --> 00:23:26,391
I'm, uh, gonna look
over here now.

564
00:23:26,393 --> 00:23:29,427
Well, we think the perp
was pulling the body

565
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:31,429
to a car that was parked
over there.

566
00:23:31,431 --> 00:23:34,065
Then he just
left him here.

567
00:23:34,067 --> 00:23:35,901
Probably afraid
he'd been spotted.

568
00:23:35,903 --> 00:23:38,803
There's a lot
of homeless in the area.

569
00:23:41,441 --> 00:23:43,008
Question is:

570
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:45,010
how'd you know
Lowenthal was the next victim

571
00:23:45,012 --> 00:23:46,511
and not the killer?

572
00:23:49,316 --> 00:23:51,750
Well, that's
quite simple, really.

573
00:23:51,752 --> 00:23:54,352
The game is directing
its players to remote locales,

574
00:23:54,354 --> 00:23:56,788
and then instructing them
to send a text message

575
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,256
indicating their presence.

576
00:23:58,258 --> 00:24:00,125
I suspect the killer wanted
to remove the body

577
00:24:00,127 --> 00:24:02,928
so he could keep this new
location “in play,” so to speak.

578
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:05,130
Still missing the “simple” part.

579
00:24:05,132 --> 00:24:06,698
The late Mr. Lowenthal

580
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,366
received his final clue

581
00:24:08,368 --> 00:24:10,235
after Harlan discovered
Ike Wallaczek's body,

582
00:24:10,237 --> 00:24:12,737
but before news of the killing
had reached the media.

583
00:24:12,739 --> 00:24:14,439
That means the
game's designer

584
00:24:14,441 --> 00:24:16,408
knew the location
had been compromised.

585
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,577
And the only way
that he could have known that,

586
00:24:18,579 --> 00:24:20,111
at the time that he knew it,

587
00:24:20,113 --> 00:24:21,880
was if he, himself,
was the killer.

588
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,917
Belphegor's Prime is not
a treasure hunt.

589
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,619
It's a trap.

590
00:24:40,696 --> 00:24:42,196
Better?

591
00:24:42,198 --> 00:24:44,665
False alarm.

592
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:47,668
But I still feel
a little queasy.

593
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,273
This new dead guy--

594
00:24:52,275 --> 00:24:54,875
your friend said that he was
tortured, too, right?

595
00:24:54,877 --> 00:24:57,244
Right before the killer tried
to abscond with his corpse.

596
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:59,213
I assume
he intended to take

597
00:24:59,215 --> 00:25:02,383
Ike Wallaczek away with him
as well, only Ike was too large.

598
00:25:02,385 --> 00:25:04,685
A speedy mothballing
was the best he could do.

599
00:25:04,687 --> 00:25:07,221
So, just to recap,

600
00:25:07,223 --> 00:25:09,657
I've spent the last
few months of my life

601
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:13,360
playing a game that was
designed to kill me.

602
00:25:13,362 --> 00:25:15,629
Got to be a metaphor
in there somewhere, right?

603
00:25:15,631 --> 00:25:18,966
I think the word you're
looking for is “moral.”

604
00:25:18,968 --> 00:25:21,902
There is a moral in there:
games are for idiots.

605
00:25:24,707 --> 00:25:26,473
Breaking news from Ramapo.

606
00:25:26,475 --> 00:25:29,443
Kitty reports the Center for
Applied Mathematics and Logic

607
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,912
is not the sponsor
of Belphegor's Prime.

608
00:25:31,914 --> 00:25:34,148
Then it's got to be
a serial killer, right?

609
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,716
Someone who's obsessed
with mathematicians?

610
00:25:35,718 --> 00:25:37,284
Mm.

611
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,920
Perhaps he was bullied
by mathematicians as a child.

612
00:25:39,922 --> 00:25:42,056
Or mathematicians
killed his parents.

613
00:25:42,058 --> 00:25:43,657
I'm being serious.

614
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:45,726
Serial killers who devise
elaborate death traps

615
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,461
are the stuff of pulp fiction.

616
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:49,229
And besides, with respect
to these murders,

617
00:25:49,231 --> 00:25:51,165
there are none
of the elaborations

618
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:53,767
which mark that sort of culprit.

619
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:55,970
If anything, I would describe
the work as businesslike.

620
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:58,172
Then it's the government.

621
00:25:58,174 --> 00:26:01,241
I mean, the-the game was some
sort of test to weed out people

622
00:26:01,243 --> 00:26:03,243
who could weaponize math.

623
00:26:03,245 --> 00:26:05,179
The American intelligence
apparatus may be clod-like,

624
00:26:05,181 --> 00:26:07,014
but I think they would
do a better job

625
00:26:07,016 --> 00:26:08,749
of disposing of two bodies,
don't you?

626
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:11,785
Watson?

627
00:26:11,787 --> 00:26:13,621
I just heard
from one of the suspects

628
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:14,922
Marcus and I talked to
yesterday,

629
00:26:14,924 --> 00:26:16,290
another puzzle-hunter.

630
00:26:16,292 --> 00:26:18,525
Tell me he confessed
to the murders.

631
00:26:18,527 --> 00:26:20,427
We ruled him out right away,
but he heard about

632
00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:22,329
Byron Lowenthal's murder on
the news and wanted me to know

633
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:25,165
he's at a friend's place,
some guy named Paul.

634
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,934
That is fascinating.

635
00:26:26,936 --> 00:26:28,369
Actually, it might be.

636
00:26:28,371 --> 00:26:31,038
Paul is positive he knows
who the killer is.

637
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,807
I know the guards
are a bit much,

638
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:35,509
but I wanted everyone
to feel safe.

639
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:38,178
And, besides,
math has been good to me.

640
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,279
Commodities.

641
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:40,848
So, you and your friends,

642
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:43,150
you were competitors
in Belphegor's Prime?

643
00:26:43,152 --> 00:26:45,352
Most of us. Some of the others
are just here for the math.

644
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,121
You said you could
identify the killer.

645
00:26:47,123 --> 00:26:49,323
I can, sort of.

646
00:26:52,061 --> 00:26:54,194
“Mo Shellshocker.”

647
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:56,930
It's a pseudonym,
obviously, but I'm telling you,

648
00:26:56,932 --> 00:26:58,365
this is the guy
you're looking for.

649
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,600
I've heard of him.

650
00:26:59,602 --> 00:27:01,335
He uses his blog
to expose bad math.

651
00:27:01,337 --> 00:27:03,837
Corrupt economists, biased
pollsters, that sort of thing.

652
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:05,572
He's actually
sort of a crusader.

653
00:27:05,574 --> 00:27:06,574
He's a murderer.

654
00:27:06,575 --> 00:27:09,143
How can you be
so sure?

655
00:27:09,145 --> 00:27:10,744
When he isn't crusading,
he's competing in puzzle hunts.

656
00:27:10,746 --> 00:27:11,812
A few months ago,

657
00:27:11,814 --> 00:27:13,080
he claimed to
have solved

658
00:27:13,082 --> 00:27:14,815
Cicada 3301 two
years in a row.

659
00:27:14,817 --> 00:27:17,484
Some people called BS,
including...

660
00:27:17,486 --> 00:27:20,120
Ike Wallaczek
and Byron Lowenthal.

661
00:27:20,122 --> 00:27:21,221
“WallaCheckYourMath,”

662
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:22,489
“ByLow2020.”

663
00:27:22,491 --> 00:27:23,757
Those are their
online handles.

664
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:25,392
Their friends
will confirm it.

665
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,528
A flame war does not
a murderer make.

666
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:30,097
The stuff these guys were
slinging at each other was ugly.

667
00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:32,099
Mo knew they were into hunts,
and so he built one

668
00:27:32,101 --> 00:27:34,034
that would send them to places
where he could kill them.

669
00:27:34,036 --> 00:27:35,469
That's what we're
doing here is

670
00:27:35,471 --> 00:27:36,837
we're just sifting
through all the math

671
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:38,338
he's posted on his blog
over the years,

672
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,840
to see if we could
find his signature

673
00:27:39,842 --> 00:27:41,975
or something that
could identify him.

674
00:27:41,977 --> 00:27:45,279
If two people weren't dead,
we'd probably be having fun.

675
00:27:45,281 --> 00:27:46,747
But still, the
chances that he left

676
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:48,582
something like that
in his math...

677
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,784
If it's there, we'll find it.
In the meantime,

678
00:27:50,786 --> 00:27:52,186
we thought the
police should know

679
00:27:52,188 --> 00:27:53,687
who they're really
dealing with.

680
00:27:53,689 --> 00:27:55,389
<i>I've got to go meet someone</i>

681
00:27:55,391 --> 00:27:56,924
about my other case.

682
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:59,927
You're good to pass all this
along to Marcus? Okay.

683
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:03,030
I must say, I'm surprised you
didn't offer to stay and help.

684
00:28:03,032 --> 00:28:05,265
Mr. Ettinger makes
a compelling case with respect

685
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,067
to Mo Shellshocker's
viability as a suspect.

686
00:28:07,069 --> 00:28:09,002
Mo is a genius.

687
00:28:09,004 --> 00:28:10,637
We're talking off the charts.

688
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:12,139
Leibniz meets Euler meets Gauss.

689
00:28:12,141 --> 00:28:14,108
Huh.
He may have an ego,

690
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,110
but he's not gonna kill
anyone over a few comments.

691
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:18,312
So, while “The League of
Concerned Mathematician”"

692
00:28:18,314 --> 00:28:21,014
chases its tail up there, I
am gonna do the smart thing

693
00:28:21,016 --> 00:28:22,416
and get out of town.

694
00:28:22,418 --> 00:28:24,485
You can let me know
when it all blows over.

695
00:28:24,487 --> 00:28:26,386
You're not going
anywhere, Harlan.

696
00:28:26,388 --> 00:28:29,223
Or should I call you
Mo Shellshocker?

697
00:28:32,728 --> 00:28:34,661
Did you honestly think
I wouldn't recognize

698
00:28:34,663 --> 00:28:36,130
an anagram of my own name?

699
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:40,567
I knew I should've gone
with “Choker Hell Moss”"

700
00:28:40,569 --> 00:28:42,569
But I never thought
that you would see it, okay?

701
00:28:42,571 --> 00:28:44,104
Math is my thing, not yours.

702
00:28:44,106 --> 00:28:46,473
It's my name, Harlan;
that makes it my thing.

703
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,675
It was an homage.

704
00:28:48,677 --> 00:28:50,043
Explain.

705
00:28:50,045 --> 00:28:52,045
Every day, all over the world,

706
00:28:52,047 --> 00:28:54,348
math is used to trick people.

707
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,917
Data dredging to sell
pharmaceuticals.

708
00:28:56,919 --> 00:28:59,720
Publication bias
to justify wars.

709
00:28:59,722 --> 00:29:02,322
In the wrong hands, math can be
manipulated, abused.

710
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:05,425
And I decided to do
something about it.

711
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:09,596
You catch people
who murder other people.

712
00:29:09,598 --> 00:29:11,431
I catch people who murder math.

713
00:29:11,433 --> 00:29:14,568
According to this,
Mo is a wanted man.

714
00:29:17,606 --> 00:29:19,940
Harlan?

715
00:29:19,942 --> 00:29:23,110
The D.O.D. was working
on a new fighter.

716
00:29:23,112 --> 00:29:27,047
Only, I knew that the
performance stats were bogus.

717
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:29,116
A friend of mine found
the internal numbers,

718
00:29:29,118 --> 00:29:31,251
and I sort of published them.

719
00:29:31,253 --> 00:29:33,320
So you put classified
Department of Defense documents

720
00:29:33,322 --> 00:29:34,888
on the Internet.

721
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:36,623
Isn't that what
you would have done?

722
00:29:38,928 --> 00:29:41,562
Fine! I screwed up, okay?

723
00:29:41,564 --> 00:29:43,730
But, hey, that's what I do,
right? I screw up.

724
00:29:43,732 --> 00:29:46,233
If I didn't, then probably you
wouldn't have secretly fired me.

725
00:29:46,235 --> 00:29:47,968
Excuse me?

726
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,403
I know about Indira Patel!

727
00:29:51,006 --> 00:29:53,340
I know you replaced me.

728
00:29:55,144 --> 00:29:58,979
Kitty, I think
we could use some tea.

729
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:04,318
Just tell me.

730
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,253
Tell me what math I got wrong.

731
00:30:06,255 --> 00:30:09,356
Tell me why you didn't let me
make it up to you.

732
00:30:09,358 --> 00:30:12,926
It wasn't the maths, it was you.

733
00:30:14,763 --> 00:30:18,232
Your work was impeccable.

734
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:20,334
And for the most part,
I enjoyed our collaborations.

735
00:30:20,336 --> 00:30:24,838
B-But over time, you just...
you became quite... needy.

736
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,406
What are you talking about?

737
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:29,109
Y-You asked my advice
on-on social matters,

738
00:30:29,111 --> 00:30:32,512
and you even invited me
to a party.

739
00:30:32,514 --> 00:30:34,648
You were my friend.

740
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,416
I was your employer, Harlan.

741
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:37,918
A-And you were my consultant.

742
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,419
One of many.

743
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:43,757
I know that I'm a little
obsessed with what I do.

744
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:46,960
That has always made it hard
to make friends.

745
00:30:46,962 --> 00:30:50,664
And I used to feel pretty bad
about that, and then I met you.

746
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:52,566
And I thought to myself,

747
00:30:52,568 --> 00:30:55,903
hey, if it doesn't bother him,
why should I let it bother me?

748
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:03,810
I got a lot
out of the work that we did.

749
00:31:03,812 --> 00:31:06,146
A lot.

750
00:31:06,148 --> 00:31:11,218
But if someone like you thinks
that I'm a loser, then...

751
00:31:22,564 --> 00:31:24,965
Hey, are we still doing this?

752
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:26,366
Doing what?

753
00:31:26,368 --> 00:31:28,502
Talking about the case.

754
00:31:28,504 --> 00:31:30,070
You're just sitting there.

755
00:31:30,072 --> 00:31:32,105
I'm thinking.

756
00:31:32,107 --> 00:31:34,308
I suspect the silence
is exacerbated

757
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,143
by the nature
of our communication.

758
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:37,811
Yes. Well, I don't
live there anymore.

759
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,713
So, if you want
to talk shop at night,

760
00:31:39,715 --> 00:31:41,515
this is the best I can do.

761
00:31:41,517 --> 00:31:45,252
Keep asking myself:
what did the killer want?

762
00:31:45,254 --> 00:31:48,255
He went to great lengths to lure
brilliant mathematicians

763
00:31:48,257 --> 00:31:49,489
to their deaths.

764
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,525
Winnowed out
the less gifted

765
00:31:51,527 --> 00:31:54,061
by making his problems
more and more complicated.

766
00:31:54,063 --> 00:31:57,597
He had a type, but I still think
he's a serial killer

767
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:59,266
only in the most
technical sense.

768
00:31:59,268 --> 00:32:01,201
He tortured both his victims.

769
00:32:01,203 --> 00:32:02,936
But there's no sign
that he enjoyed it.

770
00:32:02,938 --> 00:32:04,538
The work was
utilitarian,

771
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,740
suggesting it was
less for pleasure

772
00:32:06,742 --> 00:32:10,043
and more for persuasion.

773
00:32:10,045 --> 00:32:11,945
He wanted something.

774
00:32:11,947 --> 00:32:13,714
But what?

775
00:32:13,716 --> 00:32:16,483
Maybe there's a connection
between Wallaczek and Lowenthal

776
00:32:16,485 --> 00:32:18,418
we haven't spotted yet.

777
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,220
Maybe they were working
on a project together,

778
00:32:20,222 --> 00:32:21,822
something that was worth
a lot of money.

779
00:32:21,824 --> 00:32:23,857
There's no way the killer
could have predicted

780
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:26,093
which competitors would make it
to the terminal stage.

781
00:32:26,095 --> 00:32:28,795
That part of the game
was beyond his control.

782
00:32:28,797 --> 00:32:30,664
If it weren't,
he would've been prepared

783
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:33,300
to dispose of a body
the size of Ike Wallaczek's.

784
00:32:33,302 --> 00:32:35,335
So, even if there were a
connection between the victims,

785
00:32:35,337 --> 00:32:37,070
the killer could not
have counted on them

786
00:32:37,072 --> 00:32:38,839
being lured into his trap.

787
00:32:38,841 --> 00:32:41,041
Certainly not
in sequence.

788
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:45,112
His game was, in many respects,
one of chance.

789
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:51,718
Suggesting he knows what
he wants, but not who has it.

790
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,888
Like he was on a puzzle hunt
of his own.

791
00:32:56,825 --> 00:32:58,859
I'm back.

792
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:05,665
I'll set up
downstairs, yeah?

793
00:33:09,138 --> 00:33:11,238
I've been thinking about
what you said earlier.

794
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,740
I've decided to engage her
one more time

795
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:15,609
with regards
to her recuperation.

796
00:33:17,112 --> 00:33:21,815
I doubt she'll listen,
but I'll keep you apprised.

797
00:33:25,954 --> 00:33:27,421
I've been thinking.

798
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:29,623
About?
You. Your history.

799
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:31,825
Your decision
not to seek help.

800
00:33:31,827 --> 00:33:34,594
I think it's
a mistake.

801
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,530
Oh?

802
00:33:36,532 --> 00:33:38,198
I've looked into a number
of support groups.

803
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,633
As you are well aware,

804
00:33:39,635 --> 00:33:41,701
I have benefited greatly
from similar settings.

805
00:33:41,703 --> 00:33:43,270
You have.

806
00:33:43,272 --> 00:33:44,638
The process, I find,

807
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,906
is not unlike
voiding one's bowels...

808
00:33:45,908 --> 00:33:47,808
I'll go.
What?

809
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:49,676
I'll go.
Just get me the details.

810
00:33:52,014 --> 00:33:55,182
I've been thinking, too-- about
your number-cruncher, Harlan.

811
00:33:55,184 --> 00:33:57,017
You think I was
too hard on him.

812
00:33:57,019 --> 00:33:58,685
You will have consultants
of your own one day.

813
00:33:58,687 --> 00:34:01,488
You'll see that they require
management and focus.

814
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:04,124
They are but keys on a keyboard,
and we're the typists.

815
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:06,159
You could've given him
a shoeing for all I care.

816
00:34:06,161 --> 00:34:07,828
No, I'm just saying that

817
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:10,030
some of the stuff he's got
up to, it's quite good.

818
00:34:10,032 --> 00:34:11,698
You should take a look.

819
00:34:13,368 --> 00:34:15,735
You may find a fellow typist.

820
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,076
Hello?

821
00:34:23,078 --> 00:34:25,312
Yeah, I
hear that you and some friends

822
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:27,848
are trying to identify
Mo Shellshocker.

823
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,649
That's right. Who is this?

824
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:32,719
His name is Harlan Emple.

825
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:34,020
You got a pen?

826
00:34:34,022 --> 00:34:36,456
I'll-I'll give you his address.

827
00:34:52,454 --> 00:34:54,020
Harlan.

828
00:34:54,022 --> 00:34:56,356
You can't take a hint, can you?

829
00:34:56,358 --> 00:34:57,657
I got your text messages.

830
00:34:57,659 --> 00:34:58,958
I don't want to see you
right now.

831
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,827
So if you came here
to apologize...

832
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:03,363
Actually, I came here
to spare you an agonizing death.

833
00:35:04,299 --> 00:35:05,832
Can I come in?

834
00:35:05,834 --> 00:35:08,301
I was puzzling earlier

835
00:35:08,303 --> 00:35:12,038
as to why the killer went
to such specific lengths.

836
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,606
What did he want?

837
00:35:13,608 --> 00:35:15,809
And then Watson,
quite by accident,

838
00:35:15,811 --> 00:35:17,410
she made a most
compelling analogy.

839
00:35:17,412 --> 00:35:20,080
She said it was as if he
was on a hunt of his own.

840
00:35:20,082 --> 00:35:22,615
Duh. He was hunting
mathematicians.

841
00:35:22,617 --> 00:35:23,783
No, he wasn't.

842
00:35:23,785 --> 00:35:25,151
He was hunting<i> a</i> mathematician.

843
00:35:25,153 --> 00:35:26,619
One.

844
00:35:26,621 --> 00:35:29,389
A man who had concealed
his identity not only

845
00:35:29,391 --> 00:35:31,191
from the mathematics
community at large,

846
00:35:31,193 --> 00:35:32,859
but also from the FBI.

847
00:35:32,861 --> 00:35:35,395
A “crusader,”
you might call him.

848
00:35:35,397 --> 00:35:36,763
Wait a minute.

849
00:35:36,765 --> 00:35:38,731
Are you saying that
this was all about me?

850
00:35:53,448 --> 00:35:56,449
<i> Unfortunately, emulating</i>
<i>the work of people like me</i>

851
00:35:56,451 --> 00:35:59,018
<i>is not without risks.</i>

852
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,320
Creates enemies.

853
00:36:00,322 --> 00:36:02,889
I knew it was the government.

854
00:36:02,891 --> 00:36:04,424
It was a lottery winner.

855
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,260
Little over a year ago,

856
00:36:07,262 --> 00:36:09,529
you started a series of blogs
where you exposed the flaws

857
00:36:09,531 --> 00:36:11,664
in certain scratch card
lottery games.

858
00:36:11,666 --> 00:36:13,766
Tickets like this one.

859
00:36:13,768 --> 00:36:15,802
I wrote about
baited hook games.

860
00:36:15,804 --> 00:36:17,971
Games where the numbers
are printed on the front.

861
00:36:17,973 --> 00:36:20,707
Scratch off the hidden numbers,
hope for a match.

862
00:36:20,709 --> 00:36:23,309
Only, you proved that with
careful mathematical analysis

863
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:25,512
of the visible numbers,
you could predict

864
00:36:25,514 --> 00:36:28,381
which tickets were winners
80% of the time.

865
00:36:28,383 --> 00:36:29,682
If you had exploited

866
00:36:29,684 --> 00:36:32,085
this flaw,
rather than exposing it,

867
00:36:32,087 --> 00:36:33,520
you could have made millions.

868
00:36:33,522 --> 00:36:36,022
Well... sure.
But that would been cheating.

869
00:36:36,024 --> 00:36:37,157
Right.

870
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:38,825
So imagine
for a moment

871
00:36:38,827 --> 00:36:41,060
that you are a less
honest mathematician.

872
00:36:41,062 --> 00:36:42,495
Right?

873
00:36:42,497 --> 00:36:44,063
You've been taking
advantage of these games

874
00:36:44,065 --> 00:36:47,967
for a couple of years to
amass a small fortune.

875
00:36:47,969 --> 00:36:49,502
And then “Mo"
comes along.

876
00:36:49,504 --> 00:36:51,971
He starts exposing
the broken games.

877
00:36:51,973 --> 00:36:54,340
State lottery commissions
shut them down.

878
00:36:54,342 --> 00:36:56,976
The exploitable
games dry up.

879
00:36:56,978 --> 00:37:00,613
Now, if you were a
psychopathic lottery cheat,

880
00:37:00,615 --> 00:37:02,582
how do you fix that?

881
00:37:02,584 --> 00:37:04,484
You kill Mo.

882
00:37:04,486 --> 00:37:07,253
<i>Unfortunately, Mo is elusive.</i>

883
00:37:07,255 --> 00:37:08,821
<i>Anonymous.</i>

884
00:37:08,823 --> 00:37:11,224
The only thing
he knew about him for sure

885
00:37:11,226 --> 00:37:14,394
was that he could not resist
a puzzle hunt.

886
00:37:14,396 --> 00:37:17,130
Now, if you were smart enough
to identify

887
00:37:17,132 --> 00:37:19,399
and take advantage of
broken lottery games...

888
00:37:19,401 --> 00:37:21,868
Then I'm smart enough
to design a puzzle hunt.

889
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:25,338
This plan was not
without its flaws.

890
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:28,775
Once a competitor
reached the terminal stage,

891
00:37:28,777 --> 00:37:32,745
the killer could not be certain
that he'd trapped Mo, could he?

892
00:37:32,747 --> 00:37:34,480
So he tortured them.

893
00:37:34,482 --> 00:37:37,083
I submit he forced them to
log on to Mo's Web site,

894
00:37:37,085 --> 00:37:39,686
and when they failed...

895
00:37:41,323 --> 00:37:42,755
After two murders,

896
00:37:42,757 --> 00:37:44,290
the game was compromised.

897
00:37:44,292 --> 00:37:46,192
So the killer devises
a Plan “B.”

898
00:37:46,194 --> 00:37:47,460
He tricks

899
00:37:47,462 --> 00:37:49,229
a group of his peers

900
00:37:49,231 --> 00:37:51,097
into helping search
for an alternative means

901
00:37:51,099 --> 00:37:53,032
of identifying Mo.

902
00:37:56,504 --> 00:37:58,438
You're talking about that guy.

903
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,906
The one with the penthouse.

904
00:37:59,908 --> 00:38:02,742
<i>Paul?</i>

905
00:38:02,744 --> 00:38:05,044
Lottery winners
are public record.

906
00:38:05,046 --> 00:38:07,814
So when I searched for
the names of repeat winners

907
00:38:07,816 --> 00:38:09,482
in the dates prior
to your posts...

908
00:38:09,484 --> 00:38:11,317
I can't believe
I drank his water.

909
00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:12,685
I called him.

910
00:38:12,687 --> 00:38:14,654
I identified you as Mo.

911
00:38:14,656 --> 00:38:16,122
And I gave him your address.

912
00:38:16,124 --> 00:38:17,590
You what?!

913
00:38:21,129 --> 00:38:23,062
Drop your weapon!

914
00:38:23,064 --> 00:38:24,597
<i>I did not, however, give him</i>

915
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:25,965
<i>the correct apartment number.</i>

916
00:38:25,967 --> 00:38:28,334
He was arrested
a little over an hour ago.

917
00:38:30,739 --> 00:38:31,871
Tried to call you to
tell you, but, um...

918
00:38:31,873 --> 00:38:33,539
But I was ignoring you.

919
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:35,008
Yes, you were ignoring me.

920
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,209
Look, you know

921
00:38:36,211 --> 00:38:37,377
that I'm still screwed, right?

922
00:38:37,379 --> 00:38:39,279
You told him that I'm Mo.

923
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:42,115
He's gonna tell the police,
they're gonna tell the FBI...

924
00:38:42,117 --> 00:38:43,516
The NYPD is under
the impression

925
00:38:43,518 --> 00:38:45,385
that I lied about
your connection to Mo

926
00:38:45,387 --> 00:38:47,920
in order to draw
Mr. Ettinger out.

927
00:38:47,922 --> 00:38:49,555
As far as the
FBI goes, well,

928
00:38:49,557 --> 00:38:51,958
I've got some associates
who have created a trail

929
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,860
which will
strongly suggest that Mo

930
00:38:53,862 --> 00:38:55,728
is a cyber-terrorist
I became aware of

931
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:58,197
whilst working for, um...

932
00:38:58,199 --> 00:38:59,766
queen and country.

933
00:38:59,768 --> 00:39:02,135
Your secret's
quite safe.

934
00:39:02,137 --> 00:39:03,903
Thanks.

935
00:39:06,508 --> 00:39:09,776
My reasons for preserving you
are entirely selfish, Harlan.

936
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:13,279
You are a tremendous asset.

937
00:39:13,281 --> 00:39:15,815
I have little doubt

938
00:39:15,817 --> 00:39:19,118
I will need your help again
in the future.

939
00:39:26,461 --> 00:39:28,528
Me or him?

940
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:29,996
You.

941
00:39:29,998 --> 00:39:31,798
I have an update on
that real estate flipper.

942
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,433
I thought you might
want to know.

943
00:39:39,274 --> 00:39:41,908
I tracked down the truck rental
receipts to get her name.

944
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,142
Valerie Cork.

945
00:39:43,144 --> 00:39:44,911
She's an art authenticator.

946
00:39:44,913 --> 00:39:46,779
And that crate you saw?

947
00:39:46,781 --> 00:39:48,414
There was
something called

948
00:39:48,416 --> 00:39:50,683
a scanning fluorescence
spectrometry machine inside.

949
00:39:50,685 --> 00:39:52,251
They're used...
To find paintings

950
00:39:52,253 --> 00:39:53,553
underneath other paintings.

951
00:39:53,555 --> 00:39:55,288
So it turns out
that the building

952
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:56,689
Chad Keswick was looking to buy

953
00:39:56,691 --> 00:39:59,025
was leased by the WPA
during the Depression.

954
00:39:59,027 --> 00:40:00,927
They commissioned a
mural for the lobby.

955
00:40:00,929 --> 00:40:03,329
The artist was a
notorious communist,

956
00:40:03,331 --> 00:40:05,365
so when the property passed
into private hands in the '50s,

957
00:40:05,367 --> 00:40:06,999
the new owners
had it painted over.

958
00:40:07,001 --> 00:40:08,735
But it was still there,
under the paint.

959
00:40:08,737 --> 00:40:11,037
A lost work by Diego Rivera.

960
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:13,473
It's worth ten times
the price of the building.

961
00:40:14,676 --> 00:40:17,043
I was hoping to leak
the truth to the<i> Times.</i>

962
00:40:18,113 --> 00:40:20,046
I promised you a cut of my fee.

963
00:40:20,048 --> 00:40:22,148
But I'm pretty sure
the mural's gonna end up

964
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:24,384
in the hands of
a historical trust.

965
00:40:24,386 --> 00:40:26,352
I'd feel obligated
to refund my client,

966
00:40:26,354 --> 00:40:28,388
which means you'd get
a cut of nothing.

967
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:31,457
That works for me.

968
00:40:31,459 --> 00:40:33,493
Okay.

969
00:40:35,463 --> 00:40:37,397
I think you should know

970
00:40:37,399 --> 00:40:39,732
that I am going
to a meeting tonight.

971
00:40:41,803 --> 00:40:45,505
One of those
support groups for...

972
00:40:45,507 --> 00:40:47,340
people like me.

973
00:40:47,342 --> 00:40:49,876
It was, uh, Sherlock's idea.

974
00:40:49,878 --> 00:40:51,644
That's great.

975
00:40:51,646 --> 00:40:53,446
I know you put him up to it.

976
00:40:53,448 --> 00:40:55,381
We talked.

977
00:40:57,552 --> 00:41:00,219
When he first approached me
in London,

978
00:41:00,221 --> 00:41:03,556
I was...

979
00:41:03,558 --> 00:41:05,558
in a bad way.

980
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,227
And I had been for a while.

981
00:41:08,229 --> 00:41:11,130
But then,
when he talked about

982
00:41:11,132 --> 00:41:12,365
the work that he did,

983
00:41:12,367 --> 00:41:16,035
about the things
that he saw in me...

984
00:41:18,406 --> 00:41:19,739
I want it.

985
00:41:19,741 --> 00:41:21,874
I want every bit
of what's he offered me,

986
00:41:21,876 --> 00:41:23,843
of what he offered you, but...

987
00:41:23,845 --> 00:41:26,212
if I've learned one thing
over the last few weeks,

988
00:41:26,214 --> 00:41:28,047
it's that he can't pull it off.

989
00:41:28,049 --> 00:41:29,682
Not by himself, anyway.

990
00:41:31,586 --> 00:41:34,153
And if I'm gonna get
what I want,

991
00:41:34,155 --> 00:41:37,690
then I'm going to need
your help, too.

992
00:41:40,361 --> 00:41:42,829
I still think
the meetings are bollocks,

993
00:41:42,831 --> 00:41:44,931
but you say they're important.

994
00:41:44,933 --> 00:41:47,967
They matter to you, so...

995
00:41:47,969 --> 00:41:49,735
What do you say, Watson?

996
00:41:49,737 --> 00:41:52,071
Will you help me?

997
00:41:56,277 --> 00:41:58,244
I don't know how it happened.

998
00:41:58,246 --> 00:42:01,547
It just... hit me.

999
00:42:01,549 --> 00:42:03,983
Like a truck, out of nowhere.

1000
00:42:04,853 --> 00:42:07,753
Work is good.

1001
00:42:07,755 --> 00:42:09,755
I have friends.

1002
00:42:09,757 --> 00:42:13,092
I'm in a
relationship.

1003
00:42:13,094 --> 00:42:16,896
Somewhere along
the way, somehow,

1004
00:42:16,898 --> 00:42:19,732
I stopped being a victim

1005
00:42:19,734 --> 00:42:22,602
and became a survivor.

1006
00:42:22,604 --> 00:42:25,705
So, I guess all I'm saying is,
there's hope.

1007
00:42:26,357 --> 00:42:31,686
Do the work. Love yourself.
There's hope.

00:00:03,422 --> 00:00:04,761
If you're looking for Sherlock,
he's downstairs.

3
00:00:04,785 --> 00:00:05,841
Okay.

4
00:00:05,842 --> 00:00:07,541
<i>His name is Harlan Emple.</i>

5
00:00:07,543 --> 00:00:09,176
<i>He is the Rachel P. Hanson</i>
<i>Professor</i>

6
00:00:09,178 --> 00:00:11,301
for Applied Mathematics
at Columbia University.

7
00:00:11,301 --> 00:00:14,502
What I don't get is
why he isn't wearing a shirt.

8
00:00:14,504 --> 00:00:17,372
He doesn't like anything to come
between him and the numbers.

9
00:00:17,374 --> 00:00:18,415
What is it?

10
00:00:18,438 --> 00:00:20,274
The answers to your questions
about Kitty.

11
00:00:20,276 --> 00:00:22,710
The truth is she was a
victim of a horrific crime.

12
00:00:22,712 --> 00:00:24,646
<i>After you left last night,</i>

13
00:00:24,648 --> 00:00:26,848
Sherlock gave me an envelope.

14
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,249
Sherlock keeps saying

15
00:00:28,251 --> 00:00:30,385
that I need to get
a better sense of you,

16
00:00:30,387 --> 00:00:33,021
and maybe that will give you
a better sense of me.

17
00:00:42,065 --> 00:00:43,065
It's open.

18
00:00:47,637 --> 00:00:49,003
It's nothing.

19
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:50,872
It's Sherlock and
one of his experts.

20
00:00:50,874 --> 00:00:52,006
Which one?

21
00:00:52,008 --> 00:00:53,241
Phillip something.

22
00:00:53,243 --> 00:00:54,575
Must be new.

23
00:00:54,577 --> 00:00:57,445
He's a knife-thrower.

24
00:00:57,447 --> 00:00:58,913
Why does Sherlock have
a knife-thrower?

25
00:00:58,915 --> 00:01:00,748
He got bored the other day,

26
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,185
started looking into this, uh,
circus accident from the '30s.

27
00:01:04,187 --> 00:01:07,922
The Great Galardo perforated one
of his assistants during an act,

28
00:01:07,924 --> 00:01:09,924
except Sherlock thinks
the blade was thrown

29
00:01:09,926 --> 00:01:11,492
by somebody in the stands,
not Galardo.

30
00:01:11,494 --> 00:01:15,096
Phillip, as far as I
can tell, disagrees.

31
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:18,900
It can't be done, okay?

32
00:01:18,902 --> 00:01:19,934
It was done.

33
00:01:19,936 --> 00:01:21,335
You're wrong.

34
00:01:21,337 --> 00:01:23,538
Nobody can chuck
a knife that far.

35
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,239
What's this?

36
00:01:25,241 --> 00:01:26,207
You're...

37
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:27,209
Not here.

38
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,509
I'm not here.

39
00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:29,711
Remember that, okay?

40
00:01:29,713 --> 00:01:31,279
Oh, yes. Heaven
forfend your work

41
00:01:31,281 --> 00:01:33,247
with me should endanger
your precious day job.

42
00:01:33,249 --> 00:01:35,116
You throw knives?

43
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,252
You know, it was supposed
to be just you here.

44
00:01:38,254 --> 00:01:41,355
Phillip is arguably the greatest
knife-thrower in the world.

45
00:01:41,357 --> 00:01:42,790
Has been for decades.

46
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:43,925
Only, there's little money

47
00:01:43,927 --> 00:01:45,193
to be made
in the impalement arts.

48
00:01:45,195 --> 00:01:46,494
So, as a youth, he turned

49
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,563
to what you Americans
term “football”"

50
00:01:48,565 --> 00:01:50,131
Is this a joke?

51
00:01:53,837 --> 00:01:55,002
Phillip, head
and heart.

52
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:56,904
Come on.
Head and heart.

53
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:06,814
Can I go?

54
00:02:06,816 --> 00:02:09,484
Yeah.

55
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,489
15 years he spent throwing
that misshapen ball around.

56
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:16,057
15 years.

57
00:02:16,059 --> 00:02:18,259
When I think of the acclaim
he could have brought

58
00:02:18,261 --> 00:02:20,828
to competitive blade slinging.

59
00:02:27,237 --> 00:02:29,036
You're following me,
Watson.

60
00:02:29,038 --> 00:02:30,338
I don't like it.

61
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,740
I want you to help
me with something.

62
00:02:32,742 --> 00:02:33,908
This is Chad Keswick.

63
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,976
He buys distressed
buildings,

64
00:02:34,978 --> 00:02:36,210
paints, spackles,

65
00:02:36,212 --> 00:02:37,645
and then flips them
for quick money.

66
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:39,180
Who'd he kill?
No one.

67
00:02:39,182 --> 00:02:41,315
I was hired by one of
his rivals to find out

68
00:02:41,317 --> 00:02:43,017
why he's been circling
this old office building

69
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:44,218
in Jamaica, Queens.

70
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,586
She wants to know
why he thinks

71
00:02:45,588 --> 00:02:47,355
the building is
a good investment.

72
00:02:47,357 --> 00:02:49,590
Is there a crime in there,
something worth investigating?

73
00:02:49,592 --> 00:02:50,925
Well, I've been
shadowing Keswick,

74
00:02:50,927 --> 00:02:52,593
but yesterday I think
he noticed me.

75
00:02:52,595 --> 00:02:54,595
I want to switch
up the tail.

76
00:02:54,597 --> 00:02:57,231
You followed me for over
a week before I noticed you.

77
00:02:57,233 --> 00:02:59,033
Help me out, and I'll
cut you in on my fee.

78
00:02:59,035 --> 00:03:02,003
I don't work for you,
I work for Sherlock.

79
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:03,437
I worked for him, too.

80
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,773
And, in my experience,
he was always supportive

81
00:03:05,775 --> 00:03:07,942
of taking on work
outside the partnership.

82
00:03:07,944 --> 00:03:10,912
Sorry, it's not my cup of tea.

83
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:33,034
Hello, Portal Ten.

84
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,247
I'm here, Belphegor.

85
00:03:46,249 --> 00:03:49,784

Yeah, you called it

91
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,491
Belphegor's Prime.

92
00:04:50,761 --> 00:04:53,262
Think Cicada 3301
or Octorine's Challenge.

93

They're math games.

Math-- maybe you've heard of it.

95
00:04:56,867 --> 00:04:58,333
I've got some math for you.

96
00:04:58,335 --> 00:05:00,335
One dead guy
plus one live guy

97
00:05:00,337 --> 00:05:02,104
found in the same
deserted factory.

98
00:05:02,106 --> 00:05:06,108
I was not “found” there;
I am the one who called 911.

99
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,310
I was waiting there
for the police.

100
00:05:08,312 --> 00:05:09,745
Mr. Emple,

101
00:05:09,747 --> 00:05:11,613
we're just trying
to do our jobs, all right?

102
00:05:11,615 --> 00:05:13,048
First officers
on the scene described you

103
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,516
as “extremely agitated.”

104
00:05:14,518 --> 00:05:15,984
Well, of course
I was agitated.

105
00:05:15,986 --> 00:05:18,754
I had just found
a dead guy in mothballs!

106
00:05:18,756 --> 00:05:21,790
And did I mention that I have
not slept in almost two days?

107
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:23,358
Because of the math game.

108
00:05:24,762 --> 00:05:26,195
Can I borrow those?

109
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:31,100
This...

110
00:05:31,102 --> 00:05:33,302
is Belphegor's Prime, okay?

111
00:05:33,304 --> 00:05:35,304
It's a numeric palindrome.

112
00:05:35,306 --> 00:05:40,776
It's 666 bookended by 13 zeroes
and then bracketed with ones.

113
00:05:40,778 --> 00:05:43,846
Named for the demon Belphegor
who was a prince of hell.

114
00:05:43,848 --> 00:05:46,448
The first clue for the hunt
started making the rounds

115
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,883
a few months ago.

116
00:05:47,885 --> 00:05:49,651
It was a JPEG with two numbers
hidden in it.

117
00:05:49,653 --> 00:05:51,453
You divide those numbers
by Belphegor's Prime,

118
00:05:51,455 --> 00:05:54,890
and you get the GPS coordinates
for a restroom at the Bronx Zoo.

119
00:05:54,892 --> 00:05:56,959
You go to the restroom,
you find a phone number.

120
00:05:56,961 --> 00:05:58,927
You send a text to the number,
you get the next clue.

121
00:05:58,929 --> 00:05:59,962
Which is another math problem.

122
00:05:59,964 --> 00:06:00,929
Exactly.

123
00:06:00,931 --> 00:06:02,397
Only, this one is harder.

124
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,099
And that's how it works.

125
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:05,934
You know, but for
each one that you solve,

126
00:06:05,936 --> 00:06:08,103
you get a new set
of GPS coordinates.

127
00:06:08,105 --> 00:06:11,473
And that means that you've
completed a stage, or a portal.

128
00:06:11,475 --> 00:06:13,509
And last night,
I was on Portal Ten.

129
00:06:13,511 --> 00:06:15,711
And...

130
00:06:17,014 --> 00:06:18,313
You know what?

131
00:06:18,315 --> 00:06:20,015
I want to talk
to Sherlock and Joan.

132
00:06:20,017 --> 00:06:21,917
Look, Mr. Emple...
No, I'm sorry.

133
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,019
I told the police down
at the factory that I know them.

134
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:25,287
Isn't that the whole reason

135
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:26,922
that I was brought here
to this squad?

136
00:06:26,924 --> 00:06:30,392
I-I am not saying another word
until they are here.

137
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:35,264
Harlan Emple is
indeed an acquaintance.

138
00:06:35,266 --> 00:06:37,733
He is, in point of fact,
one of my “irregulars.”

139
00:06:37,735 --> 00:06:38,801
One of your what?

140
00:06:38,803 --> 00:06:40,302
Irregulars.

141
00:06:40,304 --> 00:06:41,770
I'm your consultant, Captain;
they are mine.

142
00:06:41,772 --> 00:06:43,572
They're a handful
of experts I turn to

143
00:06:43,574 --> 00:06:46,108
when I encounter problems which
are beyond my pool of knowledge.

144
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,810
Harlan is
a brilliant mathematician.

145
00:06:47,812 --> 00:06:49,778
And on the handful of occasions
I have tackled a case

146
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,046
which pertained
to mathematics...

147
00:06:51,048 --> 00:06:53,182
He helped you out.
Well, the good news

148
00:06:53,184 --> 00:06:56,018
for him is the preliminary
autopsy report just came in

149
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,252
before you got here.

150
00:06:57,254 --> 00:06:59,021
And the M.E. puts
the time of death

151
00:06:59,023 --> 00:07:00,989
between 4:00 and
6:00 p.m. last night.

152
00:07:00,991 --> 00:07:02,124
Mr. Emple was teaching

153
00:07:02,126 --> 00:07:03,358
a class at Columbia.

154
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,394
So the victim is
yet to be identified?

155
00:07:05,396 --> 00:07:07,663
No I.D., no phone.

156
00:07:07,665 --> 00:07:09,865
First detective on the scene
liked it for a mob hit,

157
00:07:09,867 --> 00:07:11,500
so while we're
running the prints,

158
00:07:11,502 --> 00:07:13,602
he's showing the vic's
face around OCID.

159
00:07:13,604 --> 00:07:16,839
Marcus here was about to walk
the scene with Mr. Emple.

160
00:07:16,841 --> 00:07:18,774
You're here now;
you might as well tag along.

161
00:07:18,776 --> 00:07:21,009
Actually, Captain,
I'm quite busy today.

162
00:07:21,011 --> 00:07:22,978
This is a John Doe,
and we got nothing.

163
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,247
And, like you just said,
you're my consultant.

164
00:07:25,249 --> 00:07:26,748
So, go consult.

165
00:07:29,787 --> 00:07:30,986
Watson.

166
00:07:30,988 --> 00:07:32,588
Um, he's your friend.

167
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,523
Actually, Kitty is
otherwise engaged,

168
00:07:34,525 --> 00:07:37,426
and he did actually help both
of us with a case last year.

169
00:07:37,428 --> 00:07:38,493
Did he not?

170
00:07:40,865 --> 00:07:44,099
Have I told you
how good it is to see you?

171
00:07:44,101 --> 00:07:45,367
Yes, you have.
Three times.

172
00:07:45,369 --> 00:07:46,468
Well, it is.

173
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,636
Hey, lousy circumstances.

174
00:07:47,638 --> 00:07:49,371
But, uh, hey...

175
00:07:49,373 --> 00:07:51,740
I heard from your boss that you
just, uh, got back from London.

176
00:07:51,742 --> 00:07:53,308
Were you working
a case or...?

177
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,576
No, I moved back there.

178
00:07:54,578 --> 00:07:55,677
You mean<i> moved,</i> moved?

179
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:56,845
Is there another
definition?

180
00:07:56,847 --> 00:07:58,513
I was there for
eight months,

181
00:07:58,515 --> 00:08:00,883
and had a change of heart
and returned to New York.

182
00:08:00,885 --> 00:08:02,517
So, you moved to London,
and you didn't, uh...

183
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,086
You know what?
Doesn't even matter.

184
00:08:04,088 --> 00:08:05,387
The point is you're back!

185
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:07,389
Mr. Emple.
Uh, duty calls.

186
00:08:07,391 --> 00:08:09,024
Yeah.

187
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:18,634
It's interesting.

188
00:08:18,636 --> 00:08:20,068
Mothballs are interesting?

189
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,070
They were taken from
that cabinet over there.

190
00:08:22,072 --> 00:08:25,941
Obviously, to cover the smell
of John Doe's decay.

191
00:08:25,943 --> 00:08:28,043
The killer didn't
bring them with him.

192
00:08:28,045 --> 00:08:31,179
Perhaps leaving the body here
was not part of his plan, hmm?

193
00:08:32,983 --> 00:08:36,018
Doe was shot in the foot
first and then the knee.

194
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,453
Either those were
two really bad misses or...

195
00:08:38,455 --> 00:08:41,256
Or the killer was torturing him.

196
00:08:41,258 --> 00:08:43,892
This doesn't seem like anything
you can't handle on your own.

197
00:08:43,894 --> 00:08:45,994
So you want to tell me why you
really asked me to come here?

198
00:08:45,996 --> 00:08:48,363
“This doesn't seem like anything
you can't handle on your own.”

199
00:08:48,365 --> 00:08:49,765
That's funny.

200
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:51,566
That's exactly what
I would have said

201
00:08:51,568 --> 00:08:53,602
had I been present when you
asked Kitty for her assistance

202
00:08:53,604 --> 00:08:54,937
with your tawdry side job.

203
00:08:54,939 --> 00:08:57,372
“Tawdry”?
I wanted you to know I approve.

204
00:08:57,374 --> 00:08:59,007
Of what?

205
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:01,376
Your agenda
with regards to Kitty.

206
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:03,078
Several days ago,
I gave you her file.

207
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,913
And then you show up at
the brownstone yesterday,

208
00:09:04,915 --> 00:09:06,515
and you invite her
into an investigation.

209
00:09:06,517 --> 00:09:08,183
Coincidence? No, I think not.

210
00:09:08,185 --> 00:09:11,320
You feel for her.
And now you wish to engage.

211
00:09:11,322 --> 00:09:13,956
It's not an outcome
I would have predicted, no.

212
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,458
But it is one
I approve of, yeah.

213
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,193
She could learn
a great deal from you,

214
00:09:18,195 --> 00:09:20,228
especially with regards
to how to get the most

215
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,864
from my tutelage.

216
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:25,734
So, I've already dispatched her
to, uh, follow your Mr. Keswick.

217
00:09:25,736 --> 00:09:27,836
But that's not
what I actually...

218
00:09:27,838 --> 00:09:29,404
Harlan!

219
00:09:30,741 --> 00:09:33,075
You came here to retrieve
a phone number, did you not?

220
00:09:33,077 --> 00:09:34,609
You would send a text,
and then receive

221
00:09:34,611 --> 00:09:36,845
the next clue in the game
that you were playing.

222
00:09:36,847 --> 00:09:38,747
Yeah, but I didn't find it.

223
00:09:38,749 --> 00:09:40,048
Not that I kept looking

224
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,250
after the dead guy
fell out of the locker.

225
00:09:42,252 --> 00:09:44,052
Yeah, CSU didn't find
any number either.

226
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:46,154
Probably because
it's under that paint.

227
00:09:46,156 --> 00:09:48,190
It's fresh.

228
00:09:48,192 --> 00:09:49,891
Applied in the last

229
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:52,694
24 hours.

230
00:09:52,696 --> 00:09:54,696
Right after John Doe's murder,
I'd wager.

231
00:09:54,698 --> 00:09:57,099
You don't think
this was a mob hit?

232
00:09:57,101 --> 00:09:59,101
Doe and the killer were
playing the game, too.

233
00:09:59,103 --> 00:10:01,203
The killer shot Doe and
then covered up the number

234
00:10:01,205 --> 00:10:02,704
so no one else could use it.

235
00:10:02,706 --> 00:10:04,806
What's the prize
in your little contest?

236
00:10:04,808 --> 00:10:07,576
Well, I'm doing it
mostly for the math.

237
00:10:07,578 --> 00:10:11,480
But, uh, $1,707,071.

238
00:10:11,482 --> 00:10:13,882
It's another
palindromic prime.

239
00:10:13,884 --> 00:10:17,152
Did I not mention the
money at the station?

240
00:10:17,154 --> 00:10:18,587
Who the hell can afford

241
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:20,655
that kind of payout
for a puzzle hunt?

242
00:10:20,657 --> 00:10:22,124
Well, most people
think it's CAML.

243
00:10:22,126 --> 00:10:24,593
The Center for Applied
Mathematics and Logic.

244
00:10:24,595 --> 00:10:26,094
It's located
in Ramapo...

245
00:10:26,096 --> 00:10:27,729
Wait, most people
“think” it's them?

246
00:10:27,731 --> 00:10:29,331
Well, hunts like these,

247
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,266
the organizers are
almost always anonymous.

248
00:10:31,268 --> 00:10:32,401
It's S.O.P.

249
00:10:32,403 --> 00:10:34,302
What about the
contestants?

250
00:10:34,304 --> 00:10:37,005
Is anonymity
also S.O.P.?

251
00:10:37,007 --> 00:10:39,207
For the most part, yeah.

252
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:43,078
But, guys, math peeps
are my peeps, okay?

253
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,314
It's, uh, like
a community, sort of.

254
00:10:46,316 --> 00:10:48,984
I can think of ten
or 12 other people

255
00:10:48,986 --> 00:10:50,018
who were probably competing.

256
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,186
Would that help?

257
00:10:53,157 --> 00:10:55,223
No.

258
00:10:55,225 --> 00:10:58,026
I'm sorry, I don't know him.

259
00:10:58,028 --> 00:11:00,862
But you admit you were
competing in Belphegor's Prime.

260
00:11:00,864 --> 00:11:02,197
I do.

261
00:11:04,835 --> 00:11:05,934
Pepe!

262
00:11:08,172 --> 00:11:10,439
Sorry. He doesn't
like strangers.

263
00:11:12,109 --> 00:11:14,443
Give him one of these.

264
00:11:14,445 --> 00:11:16,111
Get on his good side.

265
00:11:24,288 --> 00:11:26,354
What are you doing?

266
00:11:28,225 --> 00:11:30,725
I'm just verifying that
you've been lying to us.

267
00:11:30,727 --> 00:11:33,895
You did know the
dead man, did you not?

268
00:11:33,897 --> 00:11:36,998
I reviewed his personal
effects at the morgue earlier.

269
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,034
The coroner reported finding
crumbs in one of his pockets.

270
00:11:39,036 --> 00:11:40,036
I tasted one.

271
00:11:40,037 --> 00:11:41,269
Why would you...?

272
00:11:41,271 --> 00:11:42,771
At first, I thought
they were from

273
00:11:42,773 --> 00:11:44,439
a particularly rancid
brand of cheese,

274
00:11:44,441 --> 00:11:47,609
but, no... they're from
one of Pepe's treats.

275
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:49,277
Homemade?

276
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,481
Harlan was able to give us
the names of nine other people

277
00:11:52,483 --> 00:11:54,149
he believed to be
other competitors.

278
00:11:54,151 --> 00:11:55,984
Our colleagues are
investigating them as we speak,

279
00:11:55,986 --> 00:11:57,919
but I'll quite happily
recommend that the NYPD

280
00:11:57,921 --> 00:12:00,222
focus its attention
entirely on you.

281
00:12:04,128 --> 00:12:06,428
His name was Ike Walaczek.

282
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,231
In another lifetime,
he was my boyfriend.

283
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:10,866
And what of
this lifetime?

284
00:12:10,868 --> 00:12:12,701
We were working together.

285
00:12:12,703 --> 00:12:14,769
On Belphegor's.
What?!

286
00:12:14,771 --> 00:12:16,705
He was a numerical analyst
at the Tory Foundation.

287
00:12:16,707 --> 00:12:17,873
I work mostly in combinatorics.

288
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,307
I thought we would make
a good team.

289
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:20,742
But there aren't
supposed to be teams.

290
00:12:20,744 --> 00:12:22,711
Not in a puzzle hunt.
It's bad form.

291
00:12:22,713 --> 00:12:23,713
Harlan...

292
00:12:23,714 --> 00:12:25,514
I'm just saying...

293
00:12:25,516 --> 00:12:27,315
My husband
wouldn't understand,

294
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:30,385
so I decided I wouldn't tell him
until after we won the money.

295
00:12:30,387 --> 00:12:33,121
A team-- so that's how
you got there before me.

296
00:12:33,123 --> 00:12:34,489
I wasn't there.

297
00:12:34,491 --> 00:12:36,258
Tom and I were out of town
until this morning.

298
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,126
His cousin
was getting married in Hawaii.

299
00:12:38,128 --> 00:12:40,662
That's why Ike went
to the coordinates by himself.

300
00:12:40,664 --> 00:12:42,097
Because I couldn't.

301
00:12:44,268 --> 00:12:46,601
These are pictures I took.

302
00:12:46,603 --> 00:12:49,337
Check the dates.

303
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:51,506
You gave the police
nine other names?

304
00:12:51,508 --> 00:12:53,408
People you thought
were competing?

305
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,776
I've got 16.

306
00:12:54,778 --> 00:12:56,311
And I know they were competing.

307
00:12:58,448 --> 00:13:01,249
He talked to her
outside the Jamaica property

308
00:13:01,251 --> 00:13:05,720
for about 20 minutes,
and then this truck rolled up.

309
00:13:05,722 --> 00:13:07,822
Any idea what's
inside the crate?

310
00:13:07,824 --> 00:13:09,024
Nope.

311
00:13:09,026 --> 00:13:10,392
I can't identify
the woman either.

312
00:13:10,394 --> 00:13:12,260
Everything about her
said money though.

313
00:13:12,262 --> 00:13:15,363
She, Keswick
and the mystery box

314
00:13:15,365 --> 00:13:17,732
stayed inside the building
for about three hours,

315
00:13:17,734 --> 00:13:20,001
and then off they went.

316
00:13:20,904 --> 00:13:22,170
Good.

317
00:13:22,172 --> 00:13:23,872
Okay.

318
00:13:23,874 --> 00:13:26,074
You know where
to send the check.

319
00:13:26,076 --> 00:13:30,145
You haven't asked me about
the file Sherlock gave me.

320
00:13:30,147 --> 00:13:32,080
Why would I?

321
00:13:32,082 --> 00:13:36,184
You said it would give me
a better sense of you-- it did.

322
00:13:37,588 --> 00:13:40,155
That's why you asked
for my help.

323
00:13:40,157 --> 00:13:41,990
Because you felt sorry for me.

324
00:13:41,992 --> 00:13:44,226
No.

325
00:13:44,228 --> 00:13:46,194
You just don't seem interested
in anything

326
00:13:46,196 --> 00:13:48,063
outside of becoming
a detective.

327
00:13:48,065 --> 00:13:50,999
There she is.

328
00:13:51,001 --> 00:13:53,301
The old counselor.

329
00:13:53,303 --> 00:13:55,637
Who used to hold
Sherlock's hand.

330
00:13:57,608 --> 00:13:59,741
Everything that you read,

331
00:13:59,743 --> 00:14:02,510
everything that happened to me,
that's all it is.

332
00:14:02,512 --> 00:14:04,646
It's just something
that happened.

333
00:14:04,648 --> 00:14:08,116
And it's all
in the past now.

334
00:14:08,118 --> 00:14:10,685
So let's just
leave it there, shall we?

335
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:24,667
Hello.

336
00:14:24,668 --> 00:14:26,001
You've had sex.

337
00:14:26,003 --> 00:14:27,202
Excuse me?

338
00:14:27,204 --> 00:14:28,503
I can hear it
in your voice.

339
00:14:28,505 --> 00:14:29,771
You've joined paunches.

340
00:14:29,773 --> 00:14:30,972
Good for you, Watson.

341
00:14:30,974 --> 00:14:32,807
As you know, I think
the act of love

342
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:34,676
can be quite conducive to...
What do you want?

343
00:14:34,678 --> 00:14:36,911
Merely to apprise you
of a new development

344
00:14:36,913 --> 00:14:38,280
in the murder of
Ike Walaczek.

345
00:14:38,282 --> 00:14:40,115
As I informed
you yesterday,

346
00:14:40,117 --> 00:14:42,284
Harlan and I were given
a new list of competitors.

347
00:14:42,286 --> 00:14:45,320
One name leapt out:
Byron Lowenthal.

348
00:14:45,322 --> 00:14:48,156
He's a statistician at the
Public Utilities Commission

349
00:14:48,158 --> 00:14:50,425
and a diagnosed
paranoid schizophrenic.

350
00:14:50,427 --> 00:14:52,160
He's been hospitalized
for becoming violent

351
00:14:52,162 --> 00:14:53,728
on no fewer
than three occasions.

352
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,964
Certainly sounds like
it could be our guy.

353
00:14:55,966 --> 00:14:59,367
Unfortunately, Mr. Lowenthal had
another break earlier this year.

354
00:14:59,369 --> 00:15:02,137
He's been staying in
a transient hotel ever since.

355
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:04,239
Detective Bell and I
are going to speak with him.

356
00:15:04,241 --> 00:15:05,307
You want me to meet you?

357
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:06,875
Oh, no, we're already here.

358
00:15:06,877 --> 00:15:08,410
Anyway, now that I know
that you've enjoyed coitus

359
00:15:08,412 --> 00:15:09,778
and could enjoy more
in the near future...

360
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,846
When you're done,
we need to talk.

361
00:15:14,718 --> 00:15:16,818
Byron Lowenthal,
you in there?

362
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,053
Who is it?

363
00:15:18,055 --> 00:15:19,754
It's Detective Bell, NYPD.

364
00:15:19,756 --> 00:15:22,257
My colleague and I would like
to ask you some questions.

365
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:24,592
Let me
get some pants on.

366
00:15:37,341 --> 00:15:40,008
S-Sorry, I just... I, um...

367
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,310
I-I thought I heard
Mr. Lowenthal retr...

368
00:16:19,154 --> 00:16:21,267
You guys got lucky.

369
00:16:21,268 --> 00:16:22,868
Well, luck had little
to do with it, actually.

370
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,536
I... I heard Mr. Lowenthal

371
00:16:24,538 --> 00:16:27,039
pulling a heavy object off
a shelf, placing it on his bed,

372
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,041
and the sound of
the zipper indicated

373
00:16:29,043 --> 00:16:30,976
that it was
a large gun case.

374
00:16:30,978 --> 00:16:33,579
Looks like he was sane enough
to do math, but not much else.

375
00:16:33,581 --> 00:16:34,747
Plus, he was
pretty hopped up.

376
00:16:34,749 --> 00:16:36,448
Caffeine pills,
energy drinks,

377
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,251
pretty much every legal
stimulant you can buy.

378
00:16:39,253 --> 00:16:40,853
Plus a few illegal ones.

379
00:16:40,855 --> 00:16:42,821
Hmm. Obviously, he was
keeping himself awake

380
00:16:42,823 --> 00:16:44,490
so he could work on
Belphegor's.

381
00:16:44,492 --> 00:16:47,392
This... is obvious to you?

382
00:16:47,394 --> 00:16:48,961
I confess the maths
are beyond me,

383
00:16:48,963 --> 00:16:51,130
but I took the liberty of
sending pictures of what

384
00:16:51,132 --> 00:16:52,865
appear to be Mr. Lowenthal's
most recent scribbles

385
00:16:52,867 --> 00:16:54,166
to Harlan Emple,
and he's confirmed

386
00:16:54,168 --> 00:16:55,667
they are part of the contest.

387
00:16:55,669 --> 00:16:56,969
With your permission,
I'd like copies of these

388
00:16:56,971 --> 00:16:58,837
sent to my home
so he can review them.

389
00:16:58,839 --> 00:16:59,972
What for?

390
00:16:59,974 --> 00:17:01,073
If Byron Lowenthal

391
00:17:01,075 --> 00:17:02,441
did kill Ike Walaczek,

392
00:17:02,443 --> 00:17:04,109
then he used
and obscured a phone number,

393
00:17:04,111 --> 00:17:05,878
which would have yielded
the next problem.

394
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,379
That problem's solution

395
00:17:07,381 --> 00:17:08,714
would be GPS coordinates.

396
00:17:08,716 --> 00:17:10,415
If he's recorded them
in his books...

397
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:12,551
Your pal will be able to tell us
where he's headed next.

398
00:17:12,553 --> 00:17:14,853
I'll get our guys to give you

399
00:17:14,855 --> 00:17:16,388
whatever you need.

400
00:17:17,258 --> 00:17:18,991
Scans are still coming through,

401
00:17:18,993 --> 00:17:21,260
but I've put what we've got
so far up on the wall.

402
00:17:21,262 --> 00:17:23,262
Sherlock said that
you prefer it that way.

403
00:17:23,264 --> 00:17:25,030
Picked it up from him,
actually.

404
00:17:25,032 --> 00:17:28,600
Makes me feel like I'm really
inside of the problem.

405
00:17:30,704 --> 00:17:33,372
I'll, uh, let you know
if I need anything.

406
00:17:34,275 --> 00:17:35,974
Oh, I work without a shirt.

407
00:17:35,976 --> 00:17:38,911
Sometimes makes me feel
closer to the numbers.

408
00:17:38,913 --> 00:17:42,147
You'll need to, uh,
check the printer in the study

409
00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:43,615
for more pages.

410
00:17:43,617 --> 00:17:45,417
Uh, this is nice,
you know?

411
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:47,452
Meeting another member
of the team.

412
00:17:47,454 --> 00:17:48,654
You know, Team Sherlock.

413
00:17:48,656 --> 00:17:50,656
You help him, I help him...

414
00:17:51,926 --> 00:17:53,559
Obviously, you haven't
tackled a case

415
00:17:53,561 --> 00:17:55,093
with high-order math since
you started working with him,

416
00:17:55,095 --> 00:17:57,729
or we would've...

417
00:17:57,731 --> 00:17:59,031
What?

418
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:00,232
What?

419
00:18:00,234 --> 00:18:01,834
Wait...

420
00:18:01,836 --> 00:18:04,002
have you worked a case
with high-order math?

421
00:18:04,805 --> 00:18:06,238
You have, haven't you?

422
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,840
Does it matter?

423
00:18:07,842 --> 00:18:09,842
Of course it...

424
00:18:09,844 --> 00:18:11,443
Oh, my God.

425
00:18:11,445 --> 00:18:13,278
Did he fire me?

426
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,980
All I know
is that back in London,

427
00:18:14,982 --> 00:18:16,982
we worked a case that involved
Fibonacci spirals...

428
00:18:16,984 --> 00:18:18,483
He fired me.

429
00:18:18,485 --> 00:18:21,386
...and he called some woman
named Indira Patel.

430
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,856
She's at Berkeley.

431
00:18:23,858 --> 00:18:25,624
I'm three time zones closer!

432
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:27,125
You're here now.

433
00:18:27,127 --> 00:18:29,428
Sure, because I found
a dead body.

434
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,531
I have to go; I have to run
some errands for Sherlock.

435
00:18:35,936 --> 00:18:37,903
I-I don't know
what was in the crate,

436
00:18:37,905 --> 00:18:39,271
but the stenciling on
the side indicates

437
00:18:39,273 --> 00:18:40,772
it came from one of
the SUNY schools.

438
00:18:40,774 --> 00:18:42,908
I put another detective
on Keswick...

439
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:45,177
Don't kill me, I had to
use your razor to shave.

440
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:47,179
I...

441
00:18:47,181 --> 00:18:49,147
You must be Andrew.

442
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:50,515
Sherlock Holmes.

443
00:18:50,517 --> 00:18:52,551
Sorry.

444
00:18:52,553 --> 00:18:55,487
Joan said you were coming;
I... I forgot.

445
00:18:55,489 --> 00:18:57,122
It's not how
I wanted to meet you.

446
00:18:57,124 --> 00:18:58,891
She said you can tell
a lot about people

447
00:18:58,893 --> 00:19:00,192
just by looking at them.

448
00:19:00,194 --> 00:19:02,261
I swear, I...
usually wear pants.

449
00:19:02,263 --> 00:19:03,729
Well, in my experience,
most people

450
00:19:03,731 --> 00:19:05,264
need only be concerned
I won't notice

451
00:19:05,266 --> 00:19:06,498
anything worth remarking upon.

452
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:10,535
Watson seems adequately sexed.

453
00:19:11,939 --> 00:19:13,672
Hey.

454
00:19:13,674 --> 00:19:15,674
I was just introducing myself.

455
00:19:17,945 --> 00:19:20,379
I've got that thing.
I'll see you tonight.

456
00:19:20,381 --> 00:19:21,580
Okay.

457
00:19:27,855 --> 00:19:30,188
Your home, Watson...

458
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,823
it's utterly pleasant.

459
00:19:31,825 --> 00:19:33,692
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

460
00:19:33,694 --> 00:19:35,394
When you told me
you wanted a life of your own,

461
00:19:35,396 --> 00:19:36,595
I didn't realize
that you meant you wanted

462
00:19:36,597 --> 00:19:38,030
the same life everyone else has.

463
00:19:38,032 --> 00:19:39,464
But at any rate,
none of my business, is it?

464
00:19:39,466 --> 00:19:41,233
It's not.
And I didn't ask you here

465
00:19:41,235 --> 00:19:42,634
to talk about my apartment.

466
00:19:42,636 --> 00:19:44,970
No, you asked me here
to discuss Kitty.

467
00:19:44,972 --> 00:19:46,471
If she were not
the topic of conversation,

468
00:19:46,473 --> 00:19:48,941
then you wouldn't have
invited me to your home,

469
00:19:48,943 --> 00:19:50,776
where there's no chance
she'll be present.

470
00:19:52,346 --> 00:19:53,946
She disappointed you
in some way.

471
00:19:53,948 --> 00:19:55,247
Skills not up to snuff?

472
00:19:55,249 --> 00:19:57,316
Please remember
she is a novice.

473
00:19:57,318 --> 00:19:58,850
Actually, she did a great job.

474
00:19:58,852 --> 00:20:00,285
But I have some concerns.

475
00:20:00,287 --> 00:20:01,954
I thought we could
talk about them.

476
00:20:03,757 --> 00:20:04,923
You think that
Kitty needs help

477
00:20:04,925 --> 00:20:06,091
above and beyond
my mentorship.

478
00:20:06,093 --> 00:20:07,392
You read the same
file I did.

479
00:20:07,394 --> 00:20:08,894
She's a rape victim.

480
00:20:08,896 --> 00:20:11,296
She was kept and tortured.

481
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,899
Mm.

482
00:20:16,136 --> 00:20:19,171
You know me, so surely you know

483
00:20:19,173 --> 00:20:22,874
I've broached the subject of
a support group meeting before.

484
00:20:22,876 --> 00:20:25,010
Even offered
to pay for therapy.

485
00:20:25,012 --> 00:20:26,812
She's not interested, I know.

486
00:20:26,814 --> 00:20:28,447
Just as you also know

487
00:20:28,449 --> 00:20:30,749
someone with a problem
can't be forced to get help.

488
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:32,551
They have to want it.

489
00:20:32,553 --> 00:20:34,786
What Kitty wants
is to be a detective.

490
00:20:36,523 --> 00:20:38,490
I am taking pains
to try and channel

491
00:20:38,492 --> 00:20:40,592
her residual feelings
into her work.

492
00:20:42,329 --> 00:20:44,463
Well, that works out
great for you.

493
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:48,400
You told me that
you took on a partner

494
00:20:48,402 --> 00:20:50,635
because you wanted to replicate
what you and I had.

495
00:20:50,637 --> 00:20:52,637
That you thought it helped
with your recovery.

496
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:54,539
You think I would
try and take advantage

497
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,208
of the victim of a trauma?

498
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,910
Of course not, but there is
a conflict of interest here.

499
00:20:58,912 --> 00:21:02,447
She needs what she needs,
but you need what you need, too.

500
00:21:06,053 --> 00:21:10,055
It's-it's good that you're
in her life now, Watson.

501
00:21:10,057 --> 00:21:12,524
I mean,
it's commonly believed that, um,

502
00:21:12,526 --> 00:21:16,228
a child benefits mostly from
the presence of two parents.

503
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,164
He-- or she, in this case--
can absorb certain qualities

504
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,466
from the father--
clear-eyed view of the world,

505
00:21:21,468 --> 00:21:23,168
capacity of
rational thought, etcetera.

506
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,170
They can also absorb certain
qualities from the mother.

507
00:21:25,172 --> 00:21:27,105
Excuse me, but I am not
Kitty's mother,

508
00:21:27,107 --> 00:21:28,807
and she sure as hell
is not our child.

509
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:30,942
You brought her here;
she looks up to you.

510
00:21:30,944 --> 00:21:32,944
She says that she doesn't
need help-- fine--

511
00:21:32,946 --> 00:21:34,579
but you know better.

512
00:21:34,581 --> 00:21:37,082
And you're gonna have to be
the one that tells her.

513
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,620
It's Harlan.

514
00:21:41,622 --> 00:21:44,523
Making progress with the maths.

515
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,660
We thought
that Byron and Ike

516
00:21:48,662 --> 00:21:50,462
arrived at Portal Ten
simultaneously.

517
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,664
That would've meant that they
were doing all the same math

518
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,032
at essentially
the same time.

519
00:21:54,034 --> 00:21:56,001
Only, the math
you found at Byron's place

520
00:21:56,003 --> 00:21:57,003
says that's wrong.

521
00:21:57,004 --> 00:21:58,470
He was one step behind Ike.

522
00:21:58,472 --> 00:22:00,705
Are you proposing he did
not kill Mr. Walaczek?

523
00:22:00,707 --> 00:22:03,175
I don't know, but that's
not the weirdest part.

524
00:22:03,177 --> 00:22:04,810
Byron was obsessive.

525
00:22:04,812 --> 00:22:06,211
He time-stamped
almost everything he did.

526
00:22:06,213 --> 00:22:09,047
He only solved
the Portal Nine problem,

527
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:11,316
the same problem that sent me
to that old factory last night.

528
00:22:11,318 --> 00:22:12,884
But get this--

529
00:22:12,886 --> 00:22:14,686
he wasn't given
the same problem as me.

530
00:22:14,688 --> 00:22:16,655
And so it would've yielded
GPS coordinates

531
00:22:16,657 --> 00:22:18,323
for an entirely
different location.

532
00:22:18,325 --> 00:22:21,760
The person in charge of
the game changed the clue

533
00:22:21,762 --> 00:22:23,328
after the police
found Ike's body.

534
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:25,964
Well, he had to, right?

535
00:22:25,966 --> 00:22:27,899
If he hadn't, he would be
sending other competitors

536
00:22:27,901 --> 00:22:29,101
to an active crime scene.

537
00:22:29,103 --> 00:22:30,402
The important thing is

538
00:22:30,404 --> 00:22:31,536
I figured out the coordinates

539
00:22:31,538 --> 00:22:32,771
to the second location.

540
00:22:32,773 --> 00:22:35,540
I know where Byron went.

541
00:22:35,542 --> 00:22:36,842
What are you doing?

542
00:22:36,844 --> 00:22:38,410
You're saying he
time-stamped everything.

543
00:22:38,412 --> 00:22:40,345
I'm looking at the time
he received his clues.

544
00:22:40,347 --> 00:22:42,647
It's all there, to the second,
but what does that have to do...

545
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:44,149
What if you hadn't
found a body?

546
00:22:44,151 --> 00:22:46,118
If the game had
proceeded as planned,

547
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,486
what were you meant
to do there?

548
00:22:47,488 --> 00:22:49,354
I would have sent a text
to the phone number,

549
00:22:49,356 --> 00:22:51,523
the one that the killer painted
over, and then I would have

550
00:22:51,525 --> 00:22:52,891
gotten a message back
with the next problem.

551
00:22:52,893 --> 00:22:54,559
There's an extra
step in there.

552
00:22:54,561 --> 00:22:56,428
Why all this rigmarole with
phone numbers and texts?

553
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,064
Why not just post the problem
itself at the factory?

554
00:22:59,066 --> 00:23:02,100
I don't know, it's just the way
the game is played.

555
00:23:02,102 --> 00:23:04,102
They're for an old
industrial area in Queens.

556
00:23:04,104 --> 00:23:06,805
You're welcome
for finding your suspect.

557
00:23:06,807 --> 00:23:09,207
If I'm right, Harlan,
what you've found...

558
00:23:09,209 --> 00:23:11,109
is the site of
another murder.

559
00:23:11,111 --> 00:23:13,245
Byron Lowenthal's.

560
00:23:15,983 --> 00:23:18,216
You were right,
Lowenthal's dead.

561
00:23:18,218 --> 00:23:20,952
He was shot in the foot,
then the knee.

562
00:23:20,954 --> 00:23:22,821
Just like
Ike Wallaczek.

563
00:23:22,823 --> 00:23:26,391
I'm, uh, gonna look
over here now.

564
00:23:26,393 --> 00:23:29,427
Well, we think the perp
was pulling the body

565
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:31,429
to a car that was parked
over there.

566
00:23:31,431 --> 00:23:34,065
Then he just
left him here.

567
00:23:34,067 --> 00:23:35,901
Probably afraid
he'd been spotted.

568
00:23:35,903 --> 00:23:38,803
There's a lot
of homeless in the area.

569
00:23:41,441 --> 00:23:43,008
Question is:

570
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:45,010
how'd you know
Lowenthal was the next victim

571
00:23:45,012 --> 00:23:46,511
and not the killer?

572
00:23:49,316 --> 00:23:51,750
Well, that's
quite simple, really.

573
00:23:51,752 --> 00:23:54,352
The game is directing
its players to remote locales,

574
00:23:54,354 --> 00:23:56,788
and then instructing them
to send a text message

575
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,256
indicating their presence.

576
00:23:58,258 --> 00:24:00,125
I suspect the killer wanted
to remove the body

577
00:24:00,127 --> 00:24:02,928
so he could keep this new
location “in play,” so to speak.

578
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:05,130
Still missing the “simple” part.

579
00:24:05,132 --> 00:24:06,698
The late Mr. Lowenthal

580
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,366
received his final clue

581
00:24:08,368 --> 00:24:10,235
after Harlan discovered
Ike Wallaczek's body,

582
00:24:10,237 --> 00:24:12,737
but before news of the killing
had reached the media.

583
00:24:12,739 --> 00:24:14,439
That means the
game's designer

584
00:24:14,441 --> 00:24:16,408
knew the location
had been compromised.

585
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,577
And the only way
that he could have known that,

586
00:24:18,579 --> 00:24:20,111
at the time that he knew it,

587
00:24:20,113 --> 00:24:21,880
was if he, himself,
was the killer.

588
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,917
Belphegor's Prime is not
a treasure hunt.

589
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,619
It's a trap.

590
00:24:40,696 --> 00:24:42,196
Better?

591
00:24:42,198 --> 00:24:44,665
False alarm.

592
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:47,668
But I still feel
a little queasy.

593
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,273
This new dead guy--

594
00:24:52,275 --> 00:24:54,875
your friend said that he was
tortured, too, right?

595
00:24:54,877 --> 00:24:57,244
Right before the killer tried
to abscond with his corpse.

596
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:59,213
I assume
he intended to take

597
00:24:59,215 --> 00:25:02,383
Ike Wallaczek away with him
as well, only Ike was too large.

598
00:25:02,385 --> 00:25:04,685
A speedy mothballing
was the best he could do.

599
00:25:04,687 --> 00:25:07,221
So, just to recap,

600
00:25:07,223 --> 00:25:09,657
I've spent the last
few months of my life

601
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:13,360
playing a game that was
designed to kill me.

602
00:25:13,362 --> 00:25:15,629
Got to be a metaphor
in there somewhere, right?

603
00:25:15,631 --> 00:25:18,966
I think the word you're
looking for is “moral.”

604
00:25:18,968 --> 00:25:21,902
There is a moral in there:
games are for idiots.

605
00:25:24,707 --> 00:25:26,473
Breaking news from Ramapo.

606
00:25:26,475 --> 00:25:29,443
Kitty reports the Center for
Applied Mathematics and Logic

607
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,912
is not the sponsor
of Belphegor's Prime.

608
00:25:31,914 --> 00:25:34,148
Then it's got to be
a serial killer, right?

609
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,716
Someone who's obsessed
with mathematicians?

610
00:25:35,718 --> 00:25:37,284
Mm.

611
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,920
Perhaps he was bullied
by mathematicians as a child.

612
00:25:39,922 --> 00:25:42,056
Or mathematicians
killed his parents.

613
00:25:42,058 --> 00:25:43,657
I'm being serious.

614
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:45,726
Serial killers who devise
elaborate death traps

615
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,461
are the stuff of pulp fiction.

616
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:49,229
And besides, with respect
to these murders,

617
00:25:49,231 --> 00:25:51,165
there are none
of the elaborations

618
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:53,767
which mark that sort of culprit.

619
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:55,970
If anything, I would describe
the work as businesslike.

620
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:58,172
Then it's the government.

621
00:25:58,174 --> 00:26:01,241
I mean, the-the game was some
sort of test to weed out people

622
00:26:01,243 --> 00:26:03,243
who could weaponize math.

623
00:26:03,245 --> 00:26:05,179
The American intelligence
apparatus may be clod-like,

624
00:26:05,181 --> 00:26:07,014
but I think they would
do a better job

625
00:26:07,016 --> 00:26:08,749
of disposing of two bodies,
don't you?

626
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:11,785
Watson?

627
00:26:11,787 --> 00:26:13,621
I just heard
from one of the suspects

628
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:14,922
Marcus and I talked to
yesterday,

629
00:26:14,924 --> 00:26:16,290
another puzzle-hunter.

630
00:26:16,292 --> 00:26:18,525
Tell me he confessed
to the murders.

631
00:26:18,527 --> 00:26:20,427
We ruled him out right away,
but he heard about

632
00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:22,329
Byron Lowenthal's murder on
the news and wanted me to know

633
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:25,165
he's at a friend's place,
some guy named Paul.

634
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,934
That is fascinating.

635
00:26:26,936 --> 00:26:28,369
Actually, it might be.

636
00:26:28,371 --> 00:26:31,038
Paul is positive he knows
who the killer is.

637
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,807
I know the guards
are a bit much,

638
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:35,509
but I wanted everyone
to feel safe.

639
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:38,178
And, besides,
math has been good to me.

640
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,279
Commodities.

641
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:40,848
So, you and your friends,

642
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:43,150
you were competitors
in Belphegor's Prime?

643
00:26:43,152 --> 00:26:45,352
Most of us. Some of the others
are just here for the math.

644
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,121
You said you could
identify the killer.

645
00:26:47,123 --> 00:26:49,323
I can, sort of.

646
00:26:52,061 --> 00:26:54,194
“Mo Shellshocker.”

647
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:56,930
It's a pseudonym,
obviously, but I'm telling you,

648
00:26:56,932 --> 00:26:58,365
this is the guy
you're looking for.

649
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,600
I've heard of him.

650
00:26:59,602 --> 00:27:01,335
He uses his blog
to expose bad math.

651
00:27:01,337 --> 00:27:03,837
Corrupt economists, biased
pollsters, that sort of thing.

652
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:05,572
He's actually
sort of a crusader.

653
00:27:05,574 --> 00:27:06,574
He's a murderer.

654
00:27:06,575 --> 00:27:09,143
How can you be
so sure?

655
00:27:09,145 --> 00:27:10,744
When he isn't crusading,
he's competing in puzzle hunts.

656
00:27:10,746 --> 00:27:11,812
A few months ago,

657
00:27:11,814 --> 00:27:13,080
he claimed to
have solved

658
00:27:13,082 --> 00:27:14,815
Cicada 3301 two
years in a row.

659
00:27:14,817 --> 00:27:17,484
Some people called BS,
including...

660
00:27:17,486 --> 00:27:20,120
Ike Wallaczek
and Byron Lowenthal.

661
00:27:20,122 --> 00:27:21,221
“WallaCheckYourMath,”

662
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:22,489
“ByLow2020.”

663
00:27:22,491 --> 00:27:23,757
Those are their
online handles.

664
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:25,392
Their friends
will confirm it.

665
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,528
A flame war does not
a murderer make.

666
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:30,097
The stuff these guys were
slinging at each other was ugly.

667
00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:32,099
Mo knew they were into hunts,
and so he built one

668
00:27:32,101 --> 00:27:34,034
that would send them to places
where he could kill them.

669
00:27:34,036 --> 00:27:35,469
That's what we're
doing here is

670
00:27:35,471 --> 00:27:36,837
we're just sifting
through all the math

671
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:38,338
he's posted on his blog
over the years,

672
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,840
to see if we could
find his signature

673
00:27:39,842 --> 00:27:41,975
or something that
could identify him.

674
00:27:41,977 --> 00:27:45,279
If two people weren't dead,
we'd probably be having fun.

675
00:27:45,281 --> 00:27:46,747
But still, the
chances that he left

676
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:48,582
something like that
in his math...

677
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,784
If it's there, we'll find it.
In the meantime,

678
00:27:50,786 --> 00:27:52,186
we thought the
police should know

679
00:27:52,188 --> 00:27:53,687
who they're really
dealing with.

680
00:27:53,689 --> 00:27:55,389
<i>I've got to go meet someone</i>

681
00:27:55,391 --> 00:27:56,924
about my other case.

682
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:59,927
You're good to pass all this
along to Marcus? Okay.

683
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:03,030
I must say, I'm surprised you
didn't offer to stay and help.

684
00:28:03,032 --> 00:28:05,265
Mr. Ettinger makes
a compelling case with respect

685
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,067
to Mo Shellshocker's
viability as a suspect.

686
00:28:07,069 --> 00:28:09,002
Mo is a genius.

687
00:28:09,004 --> 00:28:10,637
We're talking off the charts.

688
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:12,139
Leibniz meets Euler meets Gauss.

689
00:28:12,141 --> 00:28:14,108
Huh.
He may have an ego,

690
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,110
but he's not gonna kill
anyone over a few comments.

691
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:18,312
So, while “The League of
Concerned Mathematician”"

692
00:28:18,314 --> 00:28:21,014
chases its tail up there, I
am gonna do the smart thing

693
00:28:21,016 --> 00:28:22,416
and get out of town.

694
00:28:22,418 --> 00:28:24,485
You can let me know
when it all blows over.

695
00:28:24,487 --> 00:28:26,386
You're not going
anywhere, Harlan.

696
00:28:26,388 --> 00:28:29,223
Or should I call you
Mo Shellshocker?

697
00:28:32,728 --> 00:28:34,661
Did you honestly think
I wouldn't recognize

698
00:28:34,663 --> 00:28:36,130
an anagram of my own name?

699
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:40,567
I knew I should've gone
with “Choker Hell Moss”"

700
00:28:40,569 --> 00:28:42,569
But I never thought
that you would see it, okay?

701
00:28:42,571 --> 00:28:44,104
Math is my thing, not yours.

702
00:28:44,106 --> 00:28:46,473
It's my name, Harlan;
that makes it my thing.

703
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,675
It was an homage.

704
00:28:48,677 --> 00:28:50,043
Explain.

705
00:28:50,045 --> 00:28:52,045
Every day, all over the world,

706
00:28:52,047 --> 00:28:54,348
math is used to trick people.

707
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,917
Data dredging to sell
pharmaceuticals.

708
00:28:56,919 --> 00:28:59,720
Publication bias
to justify wars.

709
00:28:59,722 --> 00:29:02,322
In the wrong hands, math can be
manipulated, abused.

710
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:05,425
And I decided to do
something about it.

711
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:09,596
You catch people
who murder other people.

712
00:29:09,598 --> 00:29:11,431
I catch people who murder math.

713
00:29:11,433 --> 00:29:14,568
According to this,
Mo is a wanted man.

714
00:29:17,606 --> 00:29:19,940
Harlan?

715
00:29:19,942 --> 00:29:23,110
The D.O.D. was working
on a new fighter.

716
00:29:23,112 --> 00:29:27,047
Only, I knew that the
performance stats were bogus.

717
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:29,116
A friend of mine found
the internal numbers,

718
00:29:29,118 --> 00:29:31,251
and I sort of published them.

719
00:29:31,253 --> 00:29:33,320
So you put classified
Department of Defense documents

720
00:29:33,322 --> 00:29:34,888
on the Internet.

721
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:36,623
Isn't that what
you would have done?

722
00:29:38,928 --> 00:29:41,562
Fine! I screwed up, okay?

723
00:29:41,564 --> 00:29:43,730
But, hey, that's what I do,
right? I screw up.

724
00:29:43,732 --> 00:29:46,233
If I didn't, then probably you
wouldn't have secretly fired me.

725
00:29:46,235 --> 00:29:47,968
Excuse me?

726
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,403
I know about Indira Patel!

727
00:29:51,006 --> 00:29:53,340
I know you replaced me.

728
00:29:55,144 --> 00:29:58,979
Kitty, I think
we could use some tea.

729
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:04,318
Just tell me.

730
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,253
Tell me what math I got wrong.

731
00:30:06,255 --> 00:30:09,356
Tell me why you didn't let me
make it up to you.

732
00:30:09,358 --> 00:30:12,926
It wasn't the maths, it was you.

733
00:30:14,763 --> 00:30:18,232
Your work was impeccable.

734
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:20,334
And for the most part,
I enjoyed our collaborations.

735
00:30:20,336 --> 00:30:24,838
B-But over time, you just...
you became quite... needy.

736
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,406
What are you talking about?

737
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:29,109
Y-You asked my advice
on-on social matters,

738
00:30:29,111 --> 00:30:32,512
and you even invited me
to a party.

739
00:30:32,514 --> 00:30:34,648
You were my friend.

740
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,416
I was your employer, Harlan.

741
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:37,918
A-And you were my consultant.

742
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,419
One of many.

743
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:43,757
I know that I'm a little
obsessed with what I do.

744
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:46,960
That has always made it hard
to make friends.

745
00:30:46,962 --> 00:30:50,664
And I used to feel pretty bad
about that, and then I met you.

746
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:52,566
And I thought to myself,

747
00:30:52,568 --> 00:30:55,903
hey, if it doesn't bother him,
why should I let it bother me?

748
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:03,810
I got a lot
out of the work that we did.

749
00:31:03,812 --> 00:31:06,146
A lot.

750
00:31:06,148 --> 00:31:11,218
But if someone like you thinks
that I'm a loser, then...

751
00:31:22,564 --> 00:31:24,965
Hey, are we still doing this?

752
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:26,366
Doing what?

753
00:31:26,368 --> 00:31:28,502
Talking about the case.

754
00:31:28,504 --> 00:31:30,070
You're just sitting there.

755
00:31:30,072 --> 00:31:32,105
I'm thinking.

756
00:31:32,107 --> 00:31:34,308
I suspect the silence
is exacerbated

757
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,143
by the nature
of our communication.

758
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:37,811
Yes. Well, I don't
live there anymore.

759
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,713
So, if you want
to talk shop at night,

760
00:31:39,715 --> 00:31:41,515
this is the best I can do.

761
00:31:41,517 --> 00:31:45,252
Keep asking myself:
what did the killer want?

762
00:31:45,254 --> 00:31:48,255
He went to great lengths to lure
brilliant mathematicians

763
00:31:48,257 --> 00:31:49,489
to their deaths.

764
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,525
Winnowed out
the less gifted

765
00:31:51,527 --> 00:31:54,061
by making his problems
more and more complicated.

766
00:31:54,063 --> 00:31:57,597
He had a type, but I still think
he's a serial killer

767
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:59,266
only in the most
technical sense.

768
00:31:59,268 --> 00:32:01,201
He tortured both his victims.

769
00:32:01,203 --> 00:32:02,936
But there's no sign
that he enjoyed it.

770
00:32:02,938 --> 00:32:04,538
The work was
utilitarian,

771
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,740
suggesting it was
less for pleasure

772
00:32:06,742 --> 00:32:10,043
and more for persuasion.

773
00:32:10,045 --> 00:32:11,945
He wanted something.

774
00:32:11,947 --> 00:32:13,714
But what?

775
00:32:13,716 --> 00:32:16,483
Maybe there's a connection
between Wallaczek and Lowenthal

776
00:32:16,485 --> 00:32:18,418
we haven't spotted yet.

777
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,220
Maybe they were working
on a project together,

778
00:32:20,222 --> 00:32:21,822
something that was worth
a lot of money.

779
00:32:21,824 --> 00:32:23,857
There's no way the killer
could have predicted

780
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:26,093
which competitors would make it
to the terminal stage.

781
00:32:26,095 --> 00:32:28,795
That part of the game
was beyond his control.

782
00:32:28,797 --> 00:32:30,664
If it weren't,
he would've been prepared

783
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:33,300
to dispose of a body
the size of Ike Wallaczek's.

784
00:32:33,302 --> 00:32:35,335
So, even if there were a
connection between the victims,

785
00:32:35,337 --> 00:32:37,070
the killer could not
have counted on them

786
00:32:37,072 --> 00:32:38,839
being lured into his trap.

787
00:32:38,841 --> 00:32:41,041
Certainly not
in sequence.

788
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:45,112
His game was, in many respects,
one of chance.

789
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:51,718
Suggesting he knows what
he wants, but not who has it.

790
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,888
Like he was on a puzzle hunt
of his own.

791
00:32:56,825 --> 00:32:58,859
I'm back.

792
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:05,665
I'll set up
downstairs, yeah?

793
00:33:09,138 --> 00:33:11,238
I've been thinking about
what you said earlier.

794
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,740
I've decided to engage her
one more time

795
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:15,609
with regards
to her recuperation.

796
00:33:17,112 --> 00:33:21,815
I doubt she'll listen,
but I'll keep you apprised.

797
00:33:25,954 --> 00:33:27,421
I've been thinking.

798
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:29,623
About?
You. Your history.

799
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:31,825
Your decision
not to seek help.

800
00:33:31,827 --> 00:33:34,594
I think it's
a mistake.

801
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,530
Oh?

802
00:33:36,532 --> 00:33:38,198
I've looked into a number
of support groups.

803
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,633
As you are well aware,

804
00:33:39,635 --> 00:33:41,701
I have benefited greatly
from similar settings.

805
00:33:41,703 --> 00:33:43,270
You have.

806
00:33:43,272 --> 00:33:44,638
The process, I find,

807
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,906
is not unlike
voiding one's bowels...

808
00:33:45,908 --> 00:33:47,808
I'll go.
What?

809
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:49,676
I'll go.
Just get me the details.

810
00:33:52,014 --> 00:33:55,182
I've been thinking, too-- about
your number-cruncher, Harlan.

811
00:33:55,184 --> 00:33:57,017
You think I was
too hard on him.

812
00:33:57,019 --> 00:33:58,685
You will have consultants
of your own one day.

813
00:33:58,687 --> 00:34:01,488
You'll see that they require
management and focus.

814
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:04,124
They are but keys on a keyboard,
and we're the typists.

815
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:06,159
You could've given him
a shoeing for all I care.

816
00:34:06,161 --> 00:34:07,828
No, I'm just saying that

817
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:10,030
some of the stuff he's got
up to, it's quite good.

818
00:34:10,032 --> 00:34:11,698
You should take a look.

819
00:34:13,368 --> 00:34:15,735
You may find a fellow typist.

820
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,076
Hello?

821
00:34:23,078 --> 00:34:25,312
Yeah, I
hear that you and some friends

822
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:27,848
are trying to identify
Mo Shellshocker.

823
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,649
That's right. Who is this?

824
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:32,719
His name is Harlan Emple.

825
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:34,020
You got a pen?

826
00:34:34,022 --> 00:34:36,456
I'll-I'll give you his address.

827
00:34:52,454 --> 00:34:54,020
Harlan.

828
00:34:54,022 --> 00:34:56,356
You can't take a hint, can you?

829
00:34:56,358 --> 00:34:57,657
I got your text messages.

830
00:34:57,659 --> 00:34:58,958
I don't want to see you
right now.

831
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,827
So if you came here
to apologize...

832
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:03,363
Actually, I came here
to spare you an agonizing death.

833
00:35:04,299 --> 00:35:05,832
Can I come in?

834
00:35:05,834 --> 00:35:08,301
I was puzzling earlier

835
00:35:08,303 --> 00:35:12,038
as to why the killer went
to such specific lengths.

836
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,606
What did he want?

837
00:35:13,608 --> 00:35:15,809
And then Watson,
quite by accident,

838
00:35:15,811 --> 00:35:17,410
she made a most
compelling analogy.

839
00:35:17,412 --> 00:35:20,080
She said it was as if he
was on a hunt of his own.

840
00:35:20,082 --> 00:35:22,615
Duh. He was hunting
mathematicians.

841
00:35:22,617 --> 00:35:23,783
No, he wasn't.

842
00:35:23,785 --> 00:35:25,151
He was hunting<i> a</i> mathematician.

843
00:35:25,153 --> 00:35:26,619
One.

844
00:35:26,621 --> 00:35:29,389
A man who had concealed
his identity not only

845
00:35:29,391 --> 00:35:31,191
from the mathematics
community at large,

846
00:35:31,193 --> 00:35:32,859
but also from the FBI.

847
00:35:32,861 --> 00:35:35,395
A “crusader,”
you might call him.

848
00:35:35,397 --> 00:35:36,763
Wait a minute.

849
00:35:36,765 --> 00:35:38,731
Are you saying that
this was all about me?

850
00:35:53,448 --> 00:35:56,449
<i> Unfortunately, emulating</i>
<i>the work of people like me</i>

851
00:35:56,451 --> 00:35:59,018
<i>is not without risks.</i>

852
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,320
Creates enemies.

853
00:36:00,322 --> 00:36:02,889
I knew it was the government.

854
00:36:02,891 --> 00:36:04,424
It was a lottery winner.

855
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,260
Little over a year ago,

856
00:36:07,262 --> 00:36:09,529
you started a series of blogs
where you exposed the flaws

857
00:36:09,531 --> 00:36:11,664
in certain scratch card
lottery games.

858
00:36:11,666 --> 00:36:13,766
Tickets like this one.

859
00:36:13,768 --> 00:36:15,802
I wrote about
baited hook games.

860
00:36:15,804 --> 00:36:17,971
Games where the numbers
are printed on the front.

861
00:36:17,973 --> 00:36:20,707
Scratch off the hidden numbers,
hope for a match.

862
00:36:20,709 --> 00:36:23,309
Only, you proved that with
careful mathematical analysis

863
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:25,512
of the visible numbers,
you could predict

864
00:36:25,514 --> 00:36:28,381
which tickets were winners
80% of the time.

865
00:36:28,383 --> 00:36:29,682
If you had exploited

866
00:36:29,684 --> 00:36:32,085
this flaw,
rather than exposing it,

867
00:36:32,087 --> 00:36:33,520
you could have made millions.

868
00:36:33,522 --> 00:36:36,022
Well... sure.
But that would been cheating.

869
00:36:36,024 --> 00:36:37,157
Right.

870
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:38,825
So imagine
for a moment

871
00:36:38,827 --> 00:36:41,060
that you are a less
honest mathematician.

872
00:36:41,062 --> 00:36:42,495
Right?

873
00:36:42,497 --> 00:36:44,063
You've been taking
advantage of these games

874
00:36:44,065 --> 00:36:47,967
for a couple of years to
amass a small fortune.

875
00:36:47,969 --> 00:36:49,502
And then “Mo"
comes along.

876
00:36:49,504 --> 00:36:51,971
He starts exposing
the broken games.

877
00:36:51,973 --> 00:36:54,340
State lottery commissions
shut them down.

878
00:36:54,342 --> 00:36:56,976
The exploitable
games dry up.

879
00:36:56,978 --> 00:37:00,613
Now, if you were a
psychopathic lottery cheat,

880
00:37:00,615 --> 00:37:02,582
how do you fix that?

881
00:37:02,584 --> 00:37:04,484
You kill Mo.

882
00:37:04,486 --> 00:37:07,253
<i>Unfortunately, Mo is elusive.</i>

883
00:37:07,255 --> 00:37:08,821
<i>Anonymous.</i>

884
00:37:08,823 --> 00:37:11,224
The only thing
he knew about him for sure

885
00:37:11,226 --> 00:37:14,394
was that he could not resist
a puzzle hunt.

886
00:37:14,396 --> 00:37:17,130
Now, if you were smart enough
to identify

887
00:37:17,132 --> 00:37:19,399
and take advantage of
broken lottery games...

888
00:37:19,401 --> 00:37:21,868
Then I'm smart enough
to design a puzzle hunt.

889
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:25,338
This plan was not
without its flaws.

890
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:28,775
Once a competitor
reached the terminal stage,

891
00:37:28,777 --> 00:37:32,745
the killer could not be certain
that he'd trapped Mo, could he?

892
00:37:32,747 --> 00:37:34,480
So he tortured them.

893
00:37:34,482 --> 00:37:37,083
I submit he forced them to
log on to Mo's Web site,

894
00:37:37,085 --> 00:37:39,686
and when they failed...

895
00:37:41,323 --> 00:37:42,755
After two murders,

896
00:37:42,757 --> 00:37:44,290
the game was compromised.

897
00:37:44,292 --> 00:37:46,192
So the killer devises
a Plan “B.”

898
00:37:46,194 --> 00:37:47,460
He tricks

899
00:37:47,462 --> 00:37:49,229
a group of his peers

900
00:37:49,231 --> 00:37:51,097
into helping search
for an alternative means

901
00:37:51,099 --> 00:37:53,032
of identifying Mo.

902
00:37:56,504 --> 00:37:58,438
You're talking about that guy.

903
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,906
The one with the penthouse.

904
00:37:59,908 --> 00:38:02,742
<i>Paul?</i>

905
00:38:02,744 --> 00:38:05,044
Lottery winners
are public record.

906
00:38:05,046 --> 00:38:07,814
So when I searched for
the names of repeat winners

907
00:38:07,816 --> 00:38:09,482
in the dates prior
to your posts...

908
00:38:09,484 --> 00:38:11,317
I can't believe
I drank his water.

909
00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:12,685
I called him.

910
00:38:12,687 --> 00:38:14,654
I identified you as Mo.

911
00:38:14,656 --> 00:38:16,122
And I gave him your address.

912
00:38:16,124 --> 00:38:17,590
You what?!

913
00:38:21,129 --> 00:38:23,062
Drop your weapon!

914
00:38:23,064 --> 00:38:24,597
<i>I did not, however, give him</i>

915
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:25,965
<i>the correct apartment number.</i>

916
00:38:25,967 --> 00:38:28,334
He was arrested
a little over an hour ago.

917
00:38:30,739 --> 00:38:31,871
Tried to call you to
tell you, but, um...

918
00:38:31,873 --> 00:38:33,539
But I was ignoring you.

919
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:35,008
Yes, you were ignoring me.

920
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,209
Look, you know

921
00:38:36,211 --> 00:38:37,377
that I'm still screwed, right?

922
00:38:37,379 --> 00:38:39,279
You told him that I'm Mo.

923
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:42,115
He's gonna tell the police,
they're gonna tell the FBI...

924
00:38:42,117 --> 00:38:43,516
The NYPD is under
the impression

925
00:38:43,518 --> 00:38:45,385
that I lied about
your connection to Mo

926
00:38:45,387 --> 00:38:47,920
in order to draw
Mr. Ettinger out.

927
00:38:47,922 --> 00:38:49,555
As far as the
FBI goes, well,

928
00:38:49,557 --> 00:38:51,958
I've got some associates
who have created a trail

929
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,860
which will
strongly suggest that Mo

930
00:38:53,862 --> 00:38:55,728
is a cyber-terrorist
I became aware of

931
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:58,197
whilst working for, um...

932
00:38:58,199 --> 00:38:59,766
queen and country.

933
00:38:59,768 --> 00:39:02,135
Your secret's
quite safe.

934
00:39:02,137 --> 00:39:03,903
Thanks.

935
00:39:06,508 --> 00:39:09,776
My reasons for preserving you
are entirely selfish, Harlan.

936
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:13,279
You are a tremendous asset.

937
00:39:13,281 --> 00:39:15,815
I have little doubt

938
00:39:15,817 --> 00:39:19,118
I will need your help again
in the future.

939
00:39:26,461 --> 00:39:28,528
Me or him?

940
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:29,996
You.

941
00:39:29,998 --> 00:39:31,798
I have an update on
that real estate flipper.

942
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,433
I thought you might
want to know.

943
00:39:39,274 --> 00:39:41,908
I tracked down the truck rental
receipts to get her name.

944
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,142
Valerie Cork.

945
00:39:43,144 --> 00:39:44,911
She's an art authenticator.

946
00:39:44,913 --> 00:39:46,779
And that crate you saw?

947
00:39:46,781 --> 00:39:48,414
There was
something called

948
00:39:48,416 --> 00:39:50,683
a scanning fluorescence
spectrometry machine inside.

949
00:39:50,685 --> 00:39:52,251
They're used...
To find paintings

950
00:39:52,253 --> 00:39:53,553
underneath other paintings.

951
00:39:53,555 --> 00:39:55,288
So it turns out
that the building

952
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:56,689
Chad Keswick was looking to buy

953
00:39:56,691 --> 00:39:59,025
was leased by the WPA
during the Depression.

954
00:39:59,027 --> 00:40:00,927
They commissioned a
mural for the lobby.

955
00:40:00,929 --> 00:40:03,329
The artist was a
notorious communist,

956
00:40:03,331 --> 00:40:05,365
so when the property passed
into private hands in the '50s,

957
00:40:05,367 --> 00:40:06,999
the new owners
had it painted over.

958
00:40:07,001 --> 00:40:08,735
But it was still there,
under the paint.

959
00:40:08,737 --> 00:40:11,037
A lost work by Diego Rivera.

960
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:13,473
It's worth ten times
the price of the building.

961
00:40:14,676 --> 00:40:17,043
I was hoping to leak
the truth to the<i> Times.</i>

962
00:40:18,113 --> 00:40:20,046
I promised you a cut of my fee.

963
00:40:20,048 --> 00:40:22,148
But I'm pretty sure
the mural's gonna end up

964
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:24,384
in the hands of
a historical trust.

965
00:40:24,386 --> 00:40:26,352
I'd feel obligated
to refund my client,

966
00:40:26,354 --> 00:40:28,388
which means you'd get
a cut of nothing.

967
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:31,457
That works for me.

968
00:40:31,459 --> 00:40:33,493
Okay.

969
00:40:35,463 --> 00:40:37,397
I think you should know

970
00:40:37,399 --> 00:40:39,732
that I am going
to a meeting tonight.

971
00:40:41,803 --> 00:40:45,505
One of those
support groups for...

972
00:40:45,507 --> 00:40:47,340
people like me.

973
00:40:47,342 --> 00:40:49,876
It was, uh, Sherlock's idea.

974
00:40:49,878 --> 00:40:51,644
That's great.

975
00:40:51,646 --> 00:40:53,446
I know you put him up to it.

976
00:40:53,448 --> 00:40:55,381
We talked.

977
00:40:57,552 --> 00:41:00,219
When he first approached me
in London,

978
00:41:00,221 --> 00:41:03,556
I was...

979
00:41:03,558 --> 00:41:05,558
in a bad way.

980
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,227
And I had been for a while.

981
00:41:08,229 --> 00:41:11,130
But then,
when he talked about

982
00:41:11,132 --> 00:41:12,365
the work that he did,

983
00:41:12,367 --> 00:41:16,035
about the things
that he saw in me...

984
00:41:18,406 --> 00:41:19,739
I want it.

985
00:41:19,741 --> 00:41:21,874
I want every bit
of what's he offered me,

986
00:41:21,876 --> 00:41:23,843
of what he offered you, but...

987
00:41:23,845 --> 00:41:26,212
if I've learned one thing
over the last few weeks,

988
00:41:26,214 --> 00:41:28,047
it's that he can't pull it off.

989
00:41:28,049 --> 00:41:29,682
Not by himself, anyway.

990
00:41:31,586 --> 00:41:34,153
And if I'm gonna get
what I want,

991
00:41:34,155 --> 00:41:37,690
then I'm going to need
your help, too.

992
00:41:40,361 --> 00:41:42,829
I still think
the meetings are bollocks,

993
00:41:42,831 --> 00:41:44,931
but you say they're important.

994
00:41:44,933 --> 00:41:47,967
They matter to you, so...

995
00:41:47,969 --> 00:41:49,735
What do you say, Watson?

996
00:41:49,737 --> 00:41:52,071
Will you help me?

997
00:41:56,277 --> 00:41:58,244
I don't know how it happened.

998
00:41:58,246 --> 00:42:01,547
It just... hit me.

999
00:42:01,549 --> 00:42:03,983
Like a truck, out of nowhere.

1000
00:42:04,853 --> 00:42:07,753
Work is good.

1001
00:42:07,755 --> 00:42:09,755
I have friends.

1002
00:42:09,757 --> 00:42:13,092
I'm in a
relationship.

1003
00:42:13,094 --> 00:42:16,896
Somewhere along
the way, somehow,

1004
00:42:16,898 --> 00:42:19,732
I stopped being a victim

1005
00:42:19,734 --> 00:42:22,602
and became a survivor.

1006
00:42:22,604 --> 00:42:25,705
So, I guess all I'm saying is,
there's hope.

1007
00:42:26,357 --> 00:42:31,686
Do the work. Love yourself.
There's hope.

If you're looking for Sherlock,
he's downstairs.

3
00:00:04,785 --> 00:00:05,841
Okay.

7
00:00:11,301 --> 00:00:14,502
What I don't get is
why he isn't wearing a shirt.

8
00:00:14,504 --> 00:00:17,372
He doesn't like anything to come
between him and the numbers.

9
00:00:17,374 --> 00:00:18,415
What is it?

10
00:00:18,438 --> 00:00:20,274
The answers to your questions
about Kitty.

11
00:00:20,276 --> 00:00:22,710
The truth is she was a
victim of a horrific crime.

12
00:00:22,712 --> 00:00:24,646
<i>After you left last night,</i>

13
00:00:24,648 --> 00:00:26,848
Sherlock gave me an envelope.

14

Sherlock keeps saying

15
00:00:28,251 --> 00:00:30,385
that I need to get
a better sense of you,

16
00:00:30,387 --> 00:00:33,021
and maybe that will give you
a better sense of me.

17
00:00:42,065 --> 00:00:43,065
It's open.

18
00:00:47,637 --> 00:00:49,003
It's nothing.

19
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:50,872
It's Sherlock and
one of his experts.

20
00:00:50,874 --> 00:00:52,006
Which one?

21
00:00:52,008 --> 00:00:53,241
Phillip something.

22
00:00:53,243 --> 00:00:54,575
Must be new.

23
00:00:54,577 --> 00:00:57,445
He's a knife-thrower.

24
00:00:57,447 --> 00:00:58,913
Why does Sherlock have
a knife-thrower?

25
00:00:58,915 --> 00:01:00,748
He got bored the other day,

26
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,185
started looking into this, uh,
circus accident from the '30s.

27
00:01:04,187 --> 00:01:07,922
The Great Galardo perforated one
of his assistants during an act,

28
00:01:07,924 --> 00:01:09,924
except Sherlock thinks
the blade was thrown

29
00:01:09,926 --> 00:01:11,492
by somebody in the stands,
not Galardo.

30
00:01:11,494 --> 00:01:15,096
Phillip, as far as I
can tell, disagrees.

31
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:18,900
It can't be done, okay?

32
00:01:18,902 --> 00:01:19,934
It was done.

33
00:01:19,936 --> 00:01:21,335
You're wrong.

34
00:01:21,337 --> 00:01:23,538
Nobody can chuck
a knife that far.

35
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,239
What's this?

36
00:01:25,241 --> 00:01:26,207
You're...

37
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:27,209
Not here.

38
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,509
I'm not here.

39
00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:29,711
Remember that, okay?

40
00:01:29,713 --> 00:01:31,279
Oh, yes. Heaven
forfend your work

41
00:01:31,281 --> 00:01:33,247
with me should endanger
your precious day job.

42
00:01:33,249 --> 00:01:35,116
You throw knives?

43
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,252
You know, it was supposed
to be just you here.

44
00:01:38,254 --> 00:01:41,355
Phillip is arguably the greatest
knife-thrower in the world.

45
00:01:41,357 --> 00:01:42,790
Has been for decades.

46
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:43,925
Only, there's little money

47
00:01:43,927 --> 00:01:45,193
to be made
in the impalement arts.

48
00:01:45,195 --> 00:01:46,494
So, as a youth, he turned

49
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,563
to what you Americans
term “football”"

50
00:01:48,565 --> 00:01:50,131
Is this a joke?

51
00:01:53,837 --> 00:01:55,002
Phillip, head
and heart.

52
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:56,904
Come on.
Head and heart.

53
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:06,814
Can I go?

54
00:02:06,816 --> 00:02:09,484
Yeah.

55
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,489
15 years he spent throwing
that misshapen ball around.

56
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:16,057
15 years.

57
00:02:16,059 --> 00:02:18,259
When I think of the acclaim
he could have brought

58
00:02:18,261 --> 00:02:20,828
to competitive blade slinging.

59
00:02:27,237 --> 00:02:29,036
You're following me,
Watson.

60
00:02:29,038 --> 00:02:30,338
I don't like it.

61
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,740
I want you to help
me with something.

62
00:02:32,742 --> 00:02:33,908
This is Chad Keswick.

63
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,976
He buys distressed
buildings,

64
00:02:34,978 --> 00:02:36,210
paints, spackles,

65
00:02:36,212 --> 00:02:37,645
and then flips them
for quick money.

66
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:39,180
Who'd he kill?
No one.

67
00:02:39,182 --> 00:02:41,315
I was hired by one of
his rivals to find out

68
00:02:41,317 --> 00:02:43,017
why he's been circling
this old office building

69
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:44,218
in Jamaica, Queens.

70
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,586
She wants to know
why he thinks

71
00:02:45,588 --> 00:02:47,355
the building is
a good investment.

72
00:02:47,357 --> 00:02:49,590
Is there a crime in there,
something worth investigating?

73
00:02:49,592 --> 00:02:50,925
Well, I've been
shadowing Keswick,

74
00:02:50,927 --> 00:02:52,593
but yesterday I think
he noticed me.

75
00:02:52,595 --> 00:02:54,595
I want to switch
up the tail.

76
00:02:54,597 --> 00:02:57,231
You followed me for over
a week before I noticed you.

77
00:02:57,233 --> 00:02:59,033
Help me out, and I'll
cut you in on my fee.

78
00:02:59,035 --> 00:03:02,003
I don't work for you,
I work for Sherlock.

79
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:03,437
I worked for him, too.

80
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,773
And, in my experience,
he was always supportive

81
00:03:05,775 --> 00:03:07,942
of taking on work
outside the partnership.

82
00:03:07,944 --> 00:03:10,912
Sorry, it's not my cup of tea.

83
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:33,034
Hello, Portal Ten.

84
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,247
I'm here, Belphegor.

85
00:03:46,249 --> 00:03:49,784
So where is the next clue?

Yeah, you called it
a puzzle hunt.

91
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,491
Belphegor's Prime.

92
00:04:50,761 --> 00:04:53,262
Think Cicada 3301
or Octorine's Challenge.

93
00:04:54,365 --> 00:04:55,631
They're math games.

94
00:04:55,633 --> 00:04:56,865
Math-- maybe you've heard of it.

95
00:04:56,867 --> 00:04:58,333
I've got some math for you.

96
00:04:58,335 --> 00:05:00,335
One dead guy
plus one live guy

97
00:05:00,337 --> 00:05:02,104
found in the same
deserted factory.

98
00:05:02,106 --> 00:05:06,108
I was not “found” there;
I am the one who called 911.

99
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,310
I was waiting there
for the police.

100
00:05:08,312 --> 00:05:09,745
Mr. Emple,

101
00:05:09,747 --> 00:05:11,613
we're just trying
to do our jobs, all right?

102
00:05:11,615 --> 00:05:13,048
First officers
on the scene described you

103
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,516
as “extremely agitated.”

104
00:05:14,518 --> 00:05:15,984
Well, of course
I was agitated.

105
00:05:15,986 --> 00:05:18,754
I had just found
a dead guy in mothballs!

106
00:05:18,756 --> 00:05:21,790
And did I mention that I have
not slept in almost two days?

107
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:23,358
Because of the math game.

108
00:05:24,762 --> 00:05:26,195
Can I borrow those?

109
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:31,100
This...

110
00:05:31,102 --> 00:05:33,302
is Belphegor's Prime, okay?

111
00:05:33,304 --> 00:05:35,304
It's a numeric palindrome.

112
00:05:35,306 --> 00:05:40,776
It's 666 bookended by 13 zeroes
and then bracketed with ones.

113
00:05:40,778 --> 00:05:43,846
Named for the demon Belphegor
who was a prince of hell.

114
00:05:43,848 --> 00:05:46,448
The first clue for the hunt
started making the rounds

115
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,883
a few months ago.

116
00:05:47,885 --> 00:05:49,651
It was a JPEG with two numbers
hidden in it.

117
00:05:49,653 --> 00:05:51,453
You divide those numbers
by Belphegor's Prime,

118
00:05:51,455 --> 00:05:54,890
and you get the GPS coordinates
for a restroom at the Bronx Zoo.

119
00:05:54,892 --> 00:05:56,959
You go to the restroom,
you find a phone number.

120
00:05:56,961 --> 00:05:58,927
You send a text to the number,
you get the next clue.

121
00:05:58,929 --> 00:05:59,962
Which is another math problem.

122
00:05:59,964 --> 00:06:00,929
Exactly.

123
00:06:00,931 --> 00:06:02,397
Only, this one is harder.

124
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,099
And that's how it works.

125
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:05,934
You know, but for
each one that you solve,

126
00:06:05,936 --> 00:06:08,103
you get a new set
of GPS coordinates.

127
00:06:08,105 --> 00:06:11,473
And that means that you've
completed a stage, or a portal.

128
00:06:11,475 --> 00:06:13,509
And last night,
I was on Portal Ten.

129
00:06:13,511 --> 00:06:15,711
And...

130
00:06:17,014 --> 00:06:18,313
You know what?

131
00:06:18,315 --> 00:06:20,015
I want to talk
to Sherlock and Joan.

132
00:06:20,017 --> 00:06:21,917
Look, Mr. Emple...
No, I'm sorry.

133
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,019
I told the police down
at the factory that I know them.

134
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:25,287
Isn't that the whole reason

135
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:26,922
that I was brought here
to this squad?

136
00:06:26,924 --> 00:06:30,392
I-I am not saying another word
until they are here.

137
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:35,264
Harlan Emple is
indeed an acquaintance.

138
00:06:35,266 --> 00:06:37,733
He is, in point of fact,
one of my “irregulars.”

139
00:06:37,735 --> 00:06:38,801
One of your what?

140
00:06:38,803 --> 00:06:40,302
Irregulars.

141
00:06:40,304 --> 00:06:41,770
I'm your consultant, Captain;
they are mine.

142
00:06:41,772 --> 00:06:43,572
They're a handful
of experts I turn to

143
00:06:43,574 --> 00:06:46,108
when I encounter problems which
are beyond my pool of knowledge.

144
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,810
Harlan is
a brilliant mathematician.

145
00:06:47,812 --> 00:06:49,778
And on the handful of occasions
I have tackled a case

146
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,046
which pertained
to mathematics...

147
00:06:51,048 --> 00:06:53,182
He helped you out.
Well, the good news

148
00:06:53,184 --> 00:06:56,018
for him is the preliminary
autopsy report just came in

149
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,252
before you got here.

150
00:06:57,254 --> 00:06:59,021
And the M.E. puts
the time of death

151
00:06:59,023 --> 00:07:00,989
between 4:00 and
6:00 p.m. last night.

152
00:07:00,991 --> 00:07:02,124
Mr. Emple was teaching

153
00:07:02,126 --> 00:07:03,358
a class at Columbia.

154
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,394
So the victim is
yet to be identified?

155
00:07:05,396 --> 00:07:07,663
No I.D., no phone.

156
00:07:07,665 --> 00:07:09,865
First detective on the scene
liked it for a mob hit,

157
00:07:09,867 --> 00:07:11,500
so while we're
running the prints,

158
00:07:11,502 --> 00:07:13,602
he's showing the vic's
face around OCID.

159
00:07:13,604 --> 00:07:16,839
Marcus here was about to walk
the scene with Mr. Emple.

160
00:07:16,841 --> 00:07:18,774
You're here now;
you might as well tag along.

161
00:07:18,776 --> 00:07:21,009
Actually, Captain,
I'm quite busy today.

162
00:07:21,011 --> 00:07:22,978
This is a John Doe,
and we got nothing.

163
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,247
And, like you just said,
you're my consultant.

164
00:07:25,249 --> 00:07:26,748
So, go consult.

165
00:07:29,787 --> 00:07:30,986
Watson.

166
00:07:30,988 --> 00:07:32,588
Um, he's your friend.

167
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,523
Actually, Kitty is
otherwise engaged,

168
00:07:34,525 --> 00:07:37,426
and he did actually help both
of us with a case last year.

169
00:07:37,428 --> 00:07:38,493
Did he not?

170
00:07:40,865 --> 00:07:44,099
Have I told you
how good it is to see you?

171
00:07:44,101 --> 00:07:45,367
Yes, you have.
Three times.

172
00:07:45,369 --> 00:07:46,468
Well, it is.

173
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,636
Hey, lousy circumstances.

174
00:07:47,638 --> 00:07:49,371
But, uh, hey...

175
00:07:49,373 --> 00:07:51,740
I heard from your boss that you
just, uh, got back from London.

176
00:07:51,742 --> 00:07:53,308
Were you working
a case or...?

177
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,576
No, I moved back there.

178
00:07:54,578 --> 00:07:55,677
You mean<i> moved,</i> moved?

179
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:56,845
Is there another
definition?

180
00:07:56,847 --> 00:07:58,513
I was there for
eight months,

181
00:07:58,515 --> 00:08:00,883
and had a change of heart
and returned to New York.

182
00:08:00,885 --> 00:08:02,517
So, you moved to London,
and you didn't, uh...

183
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,086
You know what?
Doesn't even matter.

184
00:08:04,088 --> 00:08:05,387
The point is you're back!

185
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:07,389
Mr. Emple.
Uh, duty calls.

186
00:08:07,391 --> 00:08:09,024
Yeah.

187
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:18,634
It's interesting.

188
00:08:18,636 --> 00:08:20,068
Mothballs are interesting?

189
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,070
They were taken from
that cabinet over there.

190
00:08:22,072 --> 00:08:25,941
Obviously, to cover the smell
of John Doe's decay.

191
00:08:25,943 --> 00:08:28,043
The killer didn't
bring them with him.

192
00:08:28,045 --> 00:08:31,179
Perhaps leaving the body here
was not part of his plan, hmm?

193
00:08:32,983 --> 00:08:36,018
Doe was shot in the foot
first and then the knee.

194
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,453
Either those were
two really bad misses or...

195
00:08:38,455 --> 00:08:41,256
Or the killer was torturing him.

196
00:08:41,258 --> 00:08:43,892
This doesn't seem like anything
you can't handle on your own.

197
00:08:43,894 --> 00:08:45,994
So you want to tell me why you
really asked me to come here?

198
00:08:45,996 --> 00:08:48,363
“This doesn't seem like anything
you can't handle on your own.”

199
00:08:48,365 --> 00:08:49,765
That's funny.

200
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:51,566
That's exactly what
I would have said

201
00:08:51,568 --> 00:08:53,602
had I been present when you
asked Kitty for her assistance

202
00:08:53,604 --> 00:08:54,937
with your tawdry side job.

203
00:08:54,939 --> 00:08:57,372
“Tawdry”?
I wanted you to know I approve.

204
00:08:57,374 --> 00:08:59,007
Of what?

205
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:01,376
Your agenda
with regards to Kitty.

206
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:03,078
Several days ago,
I gave you her file.

207
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,913
And then you show up at
the brownstone yesterday,

208
00:09:04,915 --> 00:09:06,515
and you invite her
into an investigation.

209
00:09:06,517 --> 00:09:08,183
Coincidence? No, I think not.

210
00:09:08,185 --> 00:09:11,320
You feel for her.
And now you wish to engage.

211
00:09:11,322 --> 00:09:13,956
It's not an outcome
I would have predicted, no.

212
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,458
But it is one
I approve of, yeah.

213
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,193
She could learn
a great deal from you,

214
00:09:18,195 --> 00:09:20,228
especially with regards
to how to get the most

215
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,864
from my tutelage.

216
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:25,734
So, I've already dispatched her
to, uh, follow your Mr. Keswick.

217
00:09:25,736 --> 00:09:27,836
But that's not
what I actually...

218
00:09:27,838 --> 00:09:29,404
Harlan!

219
00:09:30,741 --> 00:09:33,075
You came here to retrieve
a phone number, did you not?

220
00:09:33,077 --> 00:09:34,609
You would send a text,
and then receive

221
00:09:34,611 --> 00:09:36,845
the next clue in the game
that you were playing.

222
00:09:36,847 --> 00:09:38,747
Yeah, but I didn't find it.

223
00:09:38,749 --> 00:09:40,048
Not that I kept looking

224
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,250
after the dead guy
fell out of the locker.

225
00:09:42,252 --> 00:09:44,052
Yeah, CSU didn't find
any number either.

226
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:46,154
Probably because
it's under that paint.

227
00:09:46,156 --> 00:09:48,190
It's fresh.

228
00:09:48,192 --> 00:09:49,891
Applied in the last

229
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:52,694
24 hours.

230
00:09:52,696 --> 00:09:54,696
Right after John Doe's murder,
I'd wager.

231
00:09:54,698 --> 00:09:57,099
You don't think
this was a mob hit?

232
00:09:57,101 --> 00:09:59,101
Doe and the killer were
playing the game, too.

233
00:09:59,103 --> 00:10:01,203
The killer shot Doe and
then covered up the number

234
00:10:01,205 --> 00:10:02,704
so no one else could use it.

235
00:10:02,706 --> 00:10:04,806
What's the prize
in your little contest?

236
00:10:04,808 --> 00:10:07,576
Well, I'm doing it
mostly for the math.

237
00:10:07,578 --> 00:10:11,480
But, uh, $1,707,071.

238
00:10:11,482 --> 00:10:13,882
It's another
palindromic prime.

239
00:10:13,884 --> 00:10:17,152
Did I not mention the
money at the station?

240
00:10:17,154 --> 00:10:18,587
Who the hell can afford

241
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:20,655
that kind of payout
for a puzzle hunt?

242
00:10:20,657 --> 00:10:22,124
Well, most people
think it's CAML.

243
00:10:22,126 --> 00:10:24,593
The Center for Applied
Mathematics and Logic.

244
00:10:24,595 --> 00:10:26,094
It's located
in Ramapo...

245
00:10:26,096 --> 00:10:27,729
Wait, most people
“think” it's them?

246
00:10:27,731 --> 00:10:29,331
Well, hunts like these,

247
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,266
the organizers are
almost always anonymous.

248
00:10:31,268 --> 00:10:32,401
It's S.O.P.

249
00:10:32,403 --> 00:10:34,302
What about the
contestants?

250
00:10:34,304 --> 00:10:37,005
Is anonymity
also S.O.P.?

251
00:10:37,007 --> 00:10:39,207
For the most part, yeah.

252
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:43,078
But, guys, math peeps
are my peeps, okay?

253
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,314
It's, uh, like
a community, sort of.

254
00:10:46,316 --> 00:10:48,984
I can think of ten
or 12 other people

255
00:10:48,986 --> 00:10:50,018
who were probably competing.

256
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,186
Would that help?

257
00:10:53,157 --> 00:10:55,223
No.

258
00:10:55,225 --> 00:10:58,026
I'm sorry, I don't know him.

259
00:10:58,028 --> 00:11:00,862
But you admit you were
competing in Belphegor's Prime.

260
00:11:00,864 --> 00:11:02,197
I do.

261
00:11:04,835 --> 00:11:05,934
Pepe!

262
00:11:08,172 --> 00:11:10,439
Sorry. He doesn't
like strangers.

263
00:11:12,109 --> 00:11:14,443
Give him one of these.

264
00:11:14,445 --> 00:11:16,111
Get on his good side.

265
00:11:24,288 --> 00:11:26,354
What are you doing?

266
00:11:28,225 --> 00:11:30,725
I'm just verifying that
you've been lying to us.

267
00:11:30,727 --> 00:11:33,895
You did know the
dead man, did you not?

268
00:11:33,897 --> 00:11:36,998
I reviewed his personal
effects at the morgue earlier.

269
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,034
The coroner reported finding
crumbs in one of his pockets.

270
00:11:39,036 --> 00:11:40,036
I tasted one.

271
00:11:40,037 --> 00:11:41,269
Why would you...?

272
00:11:41,271 --> 00:11:42,771
At first, I thought
they were from

273
00:11:42,773 --> 00:11:44,439
a particularly rancid
brand of cheese,

274
00:11:44,441 --> 00:11:47,609
but, no... they're from
one of Pepe's treats.

275
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:49,277
Homemade?

276
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,481
Harlan was able to give us
the names of nine other people

277
00:11:52,483 --> 00:11:54,149
he believed to be
other competitors.

278
00:11:54,151 --> 00:11:55,984
Our colleagues are
investigating them as we speak,

279
00:11:55,986 --> 00:11:57,919
but I'll quite happily
recommend that the NYPD

280
00:11:57,921 --> 00:12:00,222
focus its attention
entirely on you.

281
00:12:04,128 --> 00:12:06,428
His name was Ike Walaczek.

282
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,231
In another lifetime,
he was my boyfriend.

283
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:10,866
And what of
this lifetime?

284
00:12:10,868 --> 00:12:12,701
We were working together.

285
00:12:12,703 --> 00:12:14,769
On Belphegor's.
What?!

286
00:12:14,771 --> 00:12:16,705
He was a numerical analyst
at the Tory Foundation.

287
00:12:16,707 --> 00:12:17,873
I work mostly in combinatorics.

288
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,307
I thought we would make
a good team.

289
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:20,742
But there aren't
supposed to be teams.

290
00:12:20,744 --> 00:12:22,711
Not in a puzzle hunt.
It's bad form.

291
00:12:22,713 --> 00:12:23,713
Harlan...

292
00:12:23,714 --> 00:12:25,514
I'm just saying...

293
00:12:25,516 --> 00:12:27,315
My husband
wouldn't understand,

294
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:30,385
so I decided I wouldn't tell him
until after we won the money.

295
00:12:30,387 --> 00:12:33,121
A team-- so that's how
you got there before me.

296
00:12:33,123 --> 00:12:34,489
I wasn't there.

297
00:12:34,491 --> 00:12:36,258
Tom and I were out of town
until this morning.

298
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,126
His cousin
was getting married in Hawaii.

299
00:12:38,128 --> 00:12:40,662
That's why Ike went
to the coordinates by himself.

300
00:12:40,664 --> 00:12:42,097
Because I couldn't.

301
00:12:44,268 --> 00:12:46,601
These are pictures I took.

302
00:12:46,603 --> 00:12:49,337
Check the dates.

303
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:51,506
You gave the police
nine other names?

304
00:12:51,508 --> 00:12:53,408
People you thought
were competing?

305
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,776
I've got 16.

306
00:12:54,778 --> 00:12:56,311
And I know they were competing.

307
00:12:58,448 --> 00:13:01,249
He talked to her
outside the Jamaica property

308
00:13:01,251 --> 00:13:05,720
for about 20 minutes,
and then this truck rolled up.

309
00:13:05,722 --> 00:13:07,822
Any idea what's
inside the crate?

310
00:13:07,824 --> 00:13:09,024
Nope.

311
00:13:09,026 --> 00:13:10,392
I can't identify
the woman either.

312
00:13:10,394 --> 00:13:12,260
Everything about her
said money though.

313
00:13:12,262 --> 00:13:15,363
She, Keswick
and the mystery box

314
00:13:15,365 --> 00:13:17,732
stayed inside the building
for about three hours,

315
00:13:17,734 --> 00:13:20,001
and then off they went.

316
00:13:20,904 --> 00:13:22,170
Good.

317
00:13:22,172 --> 00:13:23,872
Okay.

318
00:13:23,874 --> 00:13:26,074
You know where
to send the check.

319
00:13:26,076 --> 00:13:30,145
You haven't asked me about
the file Sherlock gave me.

320
00:13:30,147 --> 00:13:32,080
Why would I?

321
00:13:32,082 --> 00:13:36,184
You said it would give me
a better sense of you-- it did.

322
00:13:37,588 --> 00:13:40,155
That's why you asked
for my help.

323
00:13:40,157 --> 00:13:41,990
Because you felt sorry for me.

324
00:13:41,992 --> 00:13:44,226
No.

325
00:13:44,228 --> 00:13:46,194
You just don't seem interested
in anything

326
00:13:46,196 --> 00:13:48,063
outside of becoming
a detective.

327
00:13:48,065 --> 00:13:50,999
There she is.

328
00:13:51,001 --> 00:13:53,301
The old counselor.

329
00:13:53,303 --> 00:13:55,637
Who used to hold
Sherlock's hand.

330
00:13:57,608 --> 00:13:59,741
Everything that you read,

331
00:13:59,743 --> 00:14:02,510
everything that happened to me,
that's all it is.

332
00:14:02,512 --> 00:14:04,646
It's just something
that happened.

333
00:14:04,648 --> 00:14:08,116
And it's all
in the past now.

334
00:14:08,118 --> 00:14:10,685
So let's just
leave it there, shall we?

335
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:24,667
Hello.

336
00:14:24,668 --> 00:14:26,001
You've had sex.

337
00:14:26,003 --> 00:14:27,202
Excuse me?

338
00:14:27,204 --> 00:14:28,503
I can hear it
in your voice.

339
00:14:28,505 --> 00:14:29,771
You've joined paunches.

340
00:14:29,773 --> 00:14:30,972
Good for you, Watson.

341
00:14:30,974 --> 00:14:32,807
As you know, I think
the act of love

342
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:34,676
can be quite conducive to...
What do you want?

343
00:14:34,678 --> 00:14:36,911
Merely to apprise you
of a new development

344
00:14:36,913 --> 00:14:38,280
in the murder of
Ike Walaczek.

345
00:14:38,282 --> 00:14:40,115
As I informed
you yesterday,

346
00:14:40,117 --> 00:14:42,284
Harlan and I were given
a new list of competitors.

347
00:14:42,286 --> 00:14:45,320
One name leapt out:
Byron Lowenthal.

348
00:14:45,322 --> 00:14:48,156
He's a statistician at the
Public Utilities Commission

349
00:14:48,158 --> 00:14:50,425
and a diagnosed
paranoid schizophrenic.

350
00:14:50,427 --> 00:14:52,160
He's been hospitalized
for becoming violent

351
00:14:52,162 --> 00:14:53,728
on no fewer
than three occasions.

352
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,964
Certainly sounds like
it could be our guy.

353
00:14:55,966 --> 00:14:59,367
Unfortunately, Mr. Lowenthal had
another break earlier this year.

354
00:14:59,369 --> 00:15:02,137
He's been staying in
a transient hotel ever since.

355
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:04,239
Detective Bell and I
are going to speak with him.

356
00:15:04,241 --> 00:15:05,307
You want me to meet you?

357
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:06,875
Oh, no, we're already here.

358
00:15:06,877 --> 00:15:08,410
Anyway, now that I know
that you've enjoyed coitus

359
00:15:08,412 --> 00:15:09,778
and could enjoy more
in the near future...

360
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,846
When you're done,
we need to talk.

361
00:15:14,718 --> 00:15:16,818
Byron Lowenthal,
you in there?

362
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,053
Who is it?

363
00:15:18,055 --> 00:15:19,754
It's Detective Bell, NYPD.

364
00:15:19,756 --> 00:15:22,257
My colleague and I would like
to ask you some questions.

365
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:24,592
Let me
get some pants on.

366
00:15:37,341 --> 00:15:40,008
S-Sorry, I just... I, um...

367
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,310
I-I thought I heard
Mr. Lowenthal retr...

368
00:16:19,154 --> 00:16:21,267
You guys got lucky.

369
00:16:21,268 --> 00:16:22,868
Well, luck had little
to do with it, actually.

370
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,536
I... I heard Mr. Lowenthal

371
00:16:24,538 --> 00:16:27,039
pulling a heavy object off
a shelf, placing it on his bed,

372
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,041
and the sound of
the zipper indicated

373
00:16:29,043 --> 00:16:30,976
that it was
a large gun case.

374
00:16:30,978 --> 00:16:33,579
Looks like he was sane enough
to do math, but not much else.

375
00:16:33,581 --> 00:16:34,747
Plus, he was
pretty hopped up.

376
00:16:34,749 --> 00:16:36,448
Caffeine pills,
energy drinks,

377
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,251
pretty much every legal
stimulant you can buy.

378
00:16:39,253 --> 00:16:40,853
Plus a few illegal ones.

379
00:16:40,855 --> 00:16:42,821
Hmm. Obviously, he was
keeping himself awake

380
00:16:42,823 --> 00:16:44,490
so he could work on
Belphegor's.

381
00:16:44,492 --> 00:16:47,392
This... is obvious to you?

382
00:16:47,394 --> 00:16:48,961
I confess the maths
are beyond me,

383
00:16:48,963 --> 00:16:51,130
but I took the liberty of
sending pictures of what

384
00:16:51,132 --> 00:16:52,865
appear to be Mr. Lowenthal's
most recent scribbles

385
00:16:52,867 --> 00:16:54,166
to Harlan Emple,
and he's confirmed

386
00:16:54,168 --> 00:16:55,667
they are part of the contest.

387
00:16:55,669 --> 00:16:56,969
With your permission,
I'd like copies of these

388
00:16:56,971 --> 00:16:58,837
sent to my home
so he can review them.

389
00:16:58,839 --> 00:16:59,972
What for?

390
00:16:59,974 --> 00:17:01,073
If Byron Lowenthal

391
00:17:01,075 --> 00:17:02,441
did kill Ike Walaczek,

392
00:17:02,443 --> 00:17:04,109
then he used
and obscured a phone number,

393
00:17:04,111 --> 00:17:05,878
which would have yielded
the next problem.

394
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,379
That problem's solution

395
00:17:07,381 --> 00:17:08,714
would be GPS coordinates.

396
00:17:08,716 --> 00:17:10,415
If he's recorded them
in his books...

397
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:12,551
Your pal will be able to tell us
where he's headed next.

398
00:17:12,553 --> 00:17:14,853
I'll get our guys to give you

399
00:17:14,855 --> 00:17:16,388
whatever you need.

400
00:17:17,258 --> 00:17:18,991
Scans are still coming through,

401
00:17:18,993 --> 00:17:21,260
but I've put what we've got
so far up on the wall.

402
00:17:21,262 --> 00:17:23,262
Sherlock said that
you prefer it that way.

403
00:17:23,264 --> 00:17:25,030
Picked it up from him,
actually.

404
00:17:25,032 --> 00:17:28,600
Makes me feel like I'm really
inside of the problem.

405
00:17:30,704 --> 00:17:33,372
I'll, uh, let you know
if I need anything.

406
00:17:34,275 --> 00:17:35,974
Oh, I work without a shirt.

407
00:17:35,976 --> 00:17:38,911
Sometimes makes me feel
closer to the numbers.

408
00:17:38,913 --> 00:17:42,147
You'll need to, uh,
check the printer in the study

409
00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:43,615
for more pages.

410
00:17:43,617 --> 00:17:45,417
Uh, this is nice,
you know?

411
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:47,452
Meeting another member
of the team.

412
00:17:47,454 --> 00:17:48,654
You know, Team Sherlock.

413
00:17:48,656 --> 00:17:50,656
You help him, I help him...

414
00:17:51,926 --> 00:17:53,559
Obviously, you haven't
tackled a case

415
00:17:53,561 --> 00:17:55,093
with high-order math since
you started working with him,

416
00:17:55,095 --> 00:17:57,729
or we would've...

417
00:17:57,731 --> 00:17:59,031
What?

418
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:00,232
What?

419
00:18:00,234 --> 00:18:01,834
Wait...

420
00:18:01,836 --> 00:18:04,002
have you worked a case
with high-order math?

421
00:18:04,805 --> 00:18:06,238
You have, haven't you?

422
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,840
Does it matter?

423
00:18:07,842 --> 00:18:09,842
Of course it...

424
00:18:09,844 --> 00:18:11,443
Oh, my God.

425
00:18:11,445 --> 00:18:13,278
Did he fire me?

426
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,980
All I know
is that back in London,

427
00:18:14,982 --> 00:18:16,982
we worked a case that involved
Fibonacci spirals...

428
00:18:16,984 --> 00:18:18,483
He fired me.

429
00:18:18,485 --> 00:18:21,386
...and he called some woman
named Indira Patel.

430
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,856
She's at Berkeley.

431
00:18:23,858 --> 00:18:25,624
I'm three time zones closer!

432
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:27,125
You're here now.

433
00:18:27,127 --> 00:18:29,428
Sure, because I found
a dead body.

434
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,531
I have to go; I have to run
some errands for Sherlock.

435
00:18:35,936 --> 00:18:37,903
I-I don't know
what was in the crate,

436
00:18:37,905 --> 00:18:39,271
but the stenciling on
the side indicates

437
00:18:39,273 --> 00:18:40,772
it came from one of
the SUNY schools.

438
00:18:40,774 --> 00:18:42,908
I put another detective
on Keswick...

439
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:45,177
Don't kill me, I had to
use your razor to shave.

440
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:47,179
I...

441
00:18:47,181 --> 00:18:49,147
You must be Andrew.

442
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:50,515
Sherlock Holmes.

443
00:18:50,517 --> 00:18:52,551
Sorry.

444
00:18:52,553 --> 00:18:55,487
Joan said you were coming;
I... I forgot.

445
00:18:55,489 --> 00:18:57,122
It's not how
I wanted to meet you.

446
00:18:57,124 --> 00:18:58,891
She said you can tell
a lot about people

447
00:18:58,893 --> 00:19:00,192
just by looking at them.

448
00:19:00,194 --> 00:19:02,261
I swear, I...
usually wear pants.

449
00:19:02,263 --> 00:19:03,729
Well, in my experience,
most people

450
00:19:03,731 --> 00:19:05,264
need only be concerned
I won't notice

451
00:19:05,266 --> 00:19:06,498
anything worth remarking upon.

452
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:10,535
Watson seems adequately sexed.

453
00:19:11,939 --> 00:19:13,672
Hey.

454
00:19:13,674 --> 00:19:15,674
I was just introducing myself.

455
00:19:17,945 --> 00:19:20,379
I've got that thing.
I'll see you tonight.

456
00:19:20,381 --> 00:19:21,580
Okay.

457
00:19:27,855 --> 00:19:30,188
Your home, Watson...

458
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,823
it's utterly pleasant.

459
00:19:31,825 --> 00:19:33,692
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

460
00:19:33,694 --> 00:19:35,394
When you told me
you wanted a life of your own,

461
00:19:35,396 --> 00:19:36,595
I didn't realize
that you meant you wanted

462
00:19:36,597 --> 00:19:38,030
the same life everyone else has.

463
00:19:38,032 --> 00:19:39,464
But at any rate,
none of my business, is it?

464
00:19:39,466 --> 00:19:41,233
It's not.
And I didn't ask you here

465
00:19:41,235 --> 00:19:42,634
to talk about my apartment.

466
00:19:42,636 --> 00:19:44,970
No, you asked me here
to discuss Kitty.

467
00:19:44,972 --> 00:19:46,471
If she were not
the topic of conversation,

468
00:19:46,473 --> 00:19:48,941
then you wouldn't have
invited me to your home,

469
00:19:48,943 --> 00:19:50,776
where there's no chance
she'll be present.

470
00:19:52,346 --> 00:19:53,946
She disappointed you
in some way.

471
00:19:53,948 --> 00:19:55,247
Skills not up to snuff?

472
00:19:55,249 --> 00:19:57,316
Please remember
she is a novice.

473
00:19:57,318 --> 00:19:58,850
Actually, she did a great job.

474
00:19:58,852 --> 00:20:00,285
But I have some concerns.

475
00:20:00,287 --> 00:20:01,954
I thought we could
talk about them.

476
00:20:03,757 --> 00:20:04,923
You think that
Kitty needs help

477
00:20:04,925 --> 00:20:06,091
above and beyond
my mentorship.

478
00:20:06,093 --> 00:20:07,392
You read the same
file I did.

479
00:20:07,394 --> 00:20:08,894
She's a rape victim.

480
00:20:08,896 --> 00:20:11,296
She was kept and tortured.

481
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,899
Mm.

482
00:20:16,136 --> 00:20:19,171
You know me, so surely you know

483
00:20:19,173 --> 00:20:22,874
I've broached the subject of
a support group meeting before.

484
00:20:22,876 --> 00:20:25,010
Even offered
to pay for therapy.

485
00:20:25,012 --> 00:20:26,812
She's not interested, I know.

486
00:20:26,814 --> 00:20:28,447
Just as you also know

487
00:20:28,449 --> 00:20:30,749
someone with a problem
can't be forced to get help.

488
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:32,551
They have to want it.

489
00:20:32,553 --> 00:20:34,786
What Kitty wants
is to be a detective.

490
00:20:36,523 --> 00:20:38,490
I am taking pains
to try and channel

491
00:20:38,492 --> 00:20:40,592
her residual feelings
into her work.

492
00:20:42,329 --> 00:20:44,463
Well, that works out
great for you.

493
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:48,400
You told me that
you took on a partner

494
00:20:48,402 --> 00:20:50,635
because you wanted to replicate
what you and I had.

495
00:20:50,637 --> 00:20:52,637
That you thought it helped
with your recovery.

496
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:54,539
You think I would
try and take advantage

497
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,208
of the victim of a trauma?

498
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,910
Of course not, but there is
a conflict of interest here.

499
00:20:58,912 --> 00:21:02,447
She needs what she needs,
but you need what you need, too.

500
00:21:06,053 --> 00:21:10,055
It's-it's good that you're
in her life now, Watson.

501
00:21:10,057 --> 00:21:12,524
I mean,
it's commonly believed that, um,

502
00:21:12,526 --> 00:21:16,228
a child benefits mostly from
the presence of two parents.

503
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,164
He-- or she, in this case--
can absorb certain qualities

504
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,466
from the father--
clear-eyed view of the world,

505
00:21:21,468 --> 00:21:23,168
capacity of
rational thought, etcetera.

506
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,170
They can also absorb certain
qualities from the mother.

507
00:21:25,172 --> 00:21:27,105
Excuse me, but I am not
Kitty's mother,

508
00:21:27,107 --> 00:21:28,807
and she sure as hell
is not our child.

509
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:30,942
You brought her here;
she looks up to you.

510
00:21:30,944 --> 00:21:32,944
She says that she doesn't
need help-- fine--

511
00:21:32,946 --> 00:21:34,579
but you know better.

512
00:21:34,581 --> 00:21:37,082
And you're gonna have to be
the one that tells her.

513
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,620
It's Harlan.

514
00:21:41,622 --> 00:21:44,523
Making progress with the maths.

515
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,660
We thought
that Byron and Ike

516
00:21:48,662 --> 00:21:50,462
arrived at Portal Ten
simultaneously.

517
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,664
That would've meant that they
were doing all the same math

518
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,032
at essentially
the same time.

519
00:21:54,034 --> 00:21:56,001
Only, the math
you found at Byron's place

520
00:21:56,003 --> 00:21:57,003
says that's wrong.

521
00:21:57,004 --> 00:21:58,470
He was one step behind Ike.

522
00:21:58,472 --> 00:22:00,705
Are you proposing he did
not kill Mr. Walaczek?

523
00:22:00,707 --> 00:22:03,175
I don't know, but that's
not the weirdest part.

524
00:22:03,177 --> 00:22:04,810
Byron was obsessive.

525
00:22:04,812 --> 00:22:06,211
He time-stamped
almost everything he did.

526
00:22:06,213 --> 00:22:09,047
He only solved
the Portal Nine problem,

527
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:11,316
the same problem that sent me
to that old factory last night.

528
00:22:11,318 --> 00:22:12,884
But get this--

529
00:22:12,886 --> 00:22:14,686
he wasn't given
the same problem as me.

530
00:22:14,688 --> 00:22:16,655
And so it would've yielded
GPS coordinates

531
00:22:16,657 --> 00:22:18,323
for an entirely
different location.

532
00:22:18,325 --> 00:22:21,760
The person in charge of
the game changed the clue

533
00:22:21,762 --> 00:22:23,328
after the police
found Ike's body.

534
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:25,964
Well, he had to, right?

535
00:22:25,966 --> 00:22:27,899
If he hadn't, he would be
sending other competitors

536
00:22:27,901 --> 00:22:29,101
to an active crime scene.

537
00:22:29,103 --> 00:22:30,402
The important thing is

538
00:22:30,404 --> 00:22:31,536
I figured out the coordinates

539
00:22:31,538 --> 00:22:32,771
to the second location.

540
00:22:32,773 --> 00:22:35,540
I know where Byron went.

541
00:22:35,542 --> 00:22:36,842
What are you doing?

542
00:22:36,844 --> 00:22:38,410
You're saying he
time-stamped everything.

543
00:22:38,412 --> 00:22:40,345
I'm looking at the time
he received his clues.

544
00:22:40,347 --> 00:22:42,647
It's all there, to the second,
but what does that have to do...

545
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:44,149
What if you hadn't
found a body?

546
00:22:44,151 --> 00:22:46,118
If the game had
proceeded as planned,

547
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,486
what were you meant
to do there?

548
00:22:47,488 --> 00:22:49,354
I would have sent a text
to the phone number,

549
00:22:49,356 --> 00:22:51,523
the one that the killer painted
over, and then I would have

550
00:22:51,525 --> 00:22:52,891
gotten a message back
with the next problem.

551
00:22:52,893 --> 00:22:54,559
There's an extra
step in there.

552
00:22:54,561 --> 00:22:56,428
Why all this rigmarole with
phone numbers and texts?

553
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,064
Why not just post the problem
itself at the factory?

554
00:22:59,066 --> 00:23:02,100
I don't know, it's just the way
the game is played.

555
00:23:02,102 --> 00:23:04,102
They're for an old
industrial area in Queens.

556
00:23:04,104 --> 00:23:06,805
You're welcome
for finding your suspect.

557
00:23:06,807 --> 00:23:09,207
If I'm right, Harlan,
what you've found...

558
00:23:09,209 --> 00:23:11,109
is the site of
another murder.

559
00:23:11,111 --> 00:23:13,245
Byron Lowenthal's.

560
00:23:15,983 --> 00:23:18,216
You were right,
Lowenthal's dead.

561
00:23:18,218 --> 00:23:20,952
He was shot in the foot,
then the knee.

562
00:23:20,954 --> 00:23:22,821
Just like
Ike Wallaczek.

563
00:23:22,823 --> 00:23:26,391
I'm, uh, gonna look
over here now.

564
00:23:26,393 --> 00:23:29,427
Well, we think the perp
was pulling the body

565
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:31,429
to a car that was parked
over there.

566
00:23:31,431 --> 00:23:34,065
Then he just
left him here.

567
00:23:34,067 --> 00:23:35,901
Probably afraid
he'd been spotted.

568
00:23:35,903 --> 00:23:38,803
There's a lot
of homeless in the area.

569
00:23:41,441 --> 00:23:43,008
Question is:

570
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:45,010
how'd you know
Lowenthal was the next victim

571
00:23:45,012 --> 00:23:46,511
and not the killer?

572
00:23:49,316 --> 00:23:51,750
Well, that's
quite simple, really.

573
00:23:51,752 --> 00:23:54,352
The game is directing
its players to remote locales,

574
00:23:54,354 --> 00:23:56,788
and then instructing them
to send a text message

575
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,256
indicating their presence.

576
00:23:58,258 --> 00:24:00,125
I suspect the killer wanted
to remove the body

577
00:24:00,127 --> 00:24:02,928
so he could keep this new
location “in play,” so to speak.

578
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:05,130
Still missing the “simple” part.

579
00:24:05,132 --> 00:24:06,698
The late Mr. Lowenthal

580
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,366
received his final clue

581
00:24:08,368 --> 00:24:10,235
after Harlan discovered
Ike Wallaczek's body,

582
00:24:10,237 --> 00:24:12,737
but before news of the killing
had reached the media.

583
00:24:12,739 --> 00:24:14,439
That means the
game's designer

584
00:24:14,441 --> 00:24:16,408
knew the location
had been compromised.

585
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,577
And the only way
that he could have known that,

586
00:24:18,579 --> 00:24:20,111
at the time that he knew it,

587
00:24:20,113 --> 00:24:21,880
was if he, himself,
was the killer.

588
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,917
Belphegor's Prime is not
a treasure hunt.

589
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,619
It's a trap.

590
00:24:40,696 --> 00:24:42,196
Better?

591
00:24:42,198 --> 00:24:44,665
False alarm.

592
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:47,668
But I still feel
a little queasy.

593
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,273
This new dead guy--

594
00:24:52,275 --> 00:24:54,875
your friend said that he was
tortured, too, right?

595
00:24:54,877 --> 00:24:57,244
Right before the killer tried
to abscond with his corpse.

596
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:59,213
I assume
he intended to take

597
00:24:59,215 --> 00:25:02,383
Ike Wallaczek away with him
as well, only Ike was too large.

598
00:25:02,385 --> 00:25:04,685
A speedy mothballing
was the best he could do.

599
00:25:04,687 --> 00:25:07,221
So, just to recap,

600
00:25:07,223 --> 00:25:09,657
I've spent the last
few months of my life

601
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:13,360
playing a game that was
designed to kill me.

602
00:25:13,362 --> 00:25:15,629
Got to be a metaphor
in there somewhere, right?

603
00:25:15,631 --> 00:25:18,966
I think the word you're
looking for is “moral.”

604
00:25:18,968 --> 00:25:21,902
There is a moral in there:
games are for idiots.

605
00:25:24,707 --> 00:25:26,473
Breaking news from Ramapo.

606
00:25:26,475 --> 00:25:29,443
Kitty reports the Center for
Applied Mathematics and Logic

607
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,912
is not the sponsor
of Belphegor's Prime.

608
00:25:31,914 --> 00:25:34,148
Then it's got to be
a serial killer, right?

609
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,716
Someone who's obsessed
with mathematicians?

610
00:25:35,718 --> 00:25:37,284
Mm.

611
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,920
Perhaps he was bullied
by mathematicians as a child.

612
00:25:39,922 --> 00:25:42,056
Or mathematicians
killed his parents.

613
00:25:42,058 --> 00:25:43,657
I'm being serious.

614
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:45,726
Serial killers who devise
elaborate death traps

615
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,461
are the stuff of pulp fiction.

616
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:49,229
And besides, with respect
to these murders,

617
00:25:49,231 --> 00:25:51,165
there are none
of the elaborations

618
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:53,767
which mark that sort of culprit.

619
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:55,970
If anything, I would describe
the work as businesslike.

620
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:58,172
Then it's the government.

621
00:25:58,174 --> 00:26:01,241
I mean, the-the game was some
sort of test to weed out people

622
00:26:01,243 --> 00:26:03,243
who could weaponize math.

623
00:26:03,245 --> 00:26:05,179
The American intelligence
apparatus may be clod-like,

624
00:26:05,181 --> 00:26:07,014
but I think they would
do a better job

625
00:26:07,016 --> 00:26:08,749
of disposing of two bodies,
don't you?

626
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:11,785
Watson?

627
00:26:11,787 --> 00:26:13,621
I just heard
from one of the suspects

628
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:14,922
Marcus and I talked to
yesterday,

629
00:26:14,924 --> 00:26:16,290
another puzzle-hunter.

630
00:26:16,292 --> 00:26:18,525
Tell me he confessed
to the murders.

631
00:26:18,527 --> 00:26:20,427
We ruled him out right away,
but he heard about

632
00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:22,329
Byron Lowenthal's murder on
the news and wanted me to know

633
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:25,165
he's at a friend's place,
some guy named Paul.

634
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,934
That is fascinating.

635
00:26:26,936 --> 00:26:28,369
Actually, it might be.

636
00:26:28,371 --> 00:26:31,038
Paul is positive he knows
who the killer is.

637
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,807
I know the guards
are a bit much,

638
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:35,509
but I wanted everyone
to feel safe.

639
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:38,178
And, besides,
math has been good to me.

640
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,279
Commodities.

641
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:40,848
So, you and your friends,

642
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:43,150
you were competitors
in Belphegor's Prime?

643
00:26:43,152 --> 00:26:45,352
Most of us. Some of the others
are just here for the math.

644
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,121
You said you could
identify the killer.

645
00:26:47,123 --> 00:26:49,323
I can, sort of.

646
00:26:52,061 --> 00:26:54,194
“Mo Shellshocker.”

647
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:56,930
It's a pseudonym,
obviously, but I'm telling you,

648
00:26:56,932 --> 00:26:58,365
this is the guy
you're looking for.

649
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,600
I've heard of him.

650
00:26:59,602 --> 00:27:01,335
He uses his blog
to expose bad math.

651
00:27:01,337 --> 00:27:03,837
Corrupt economists, biased
pollsters, that sort of thing.

652
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:05,572
He's actually
sort of a crusader.

653
00:27:05,574 --> 00:27:06,574
He's a murderer.

654
00:27:06,575 --> 00:27:09,143
How can you be
so sure?

655
00:27:09,145 --> 00:27:10,744
When he isn't crusading,
he's competing in puzzle hunts.

656
00:27:10,746 --> 00:27:11,812
A few months ago,

657
00:27:11,814 --> 00:27:13,080
he claimed to
have solved

658
00:27:13,082 --> 00:27:14,815
Cicada 3301 two
years in a row.

659
00:27:14,817 --> 00:27:17,484
Some people called BS,
including...

660
00:27:17,486 --> 00:27:20,120
Ike Wallaczek
and Byron Lowenthal.

661
00:27:20,122 --> 00:27:21,221
“WallaCheckYourMath,”

662
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:22,489
“ByLow2020.”

663
00:27:22,491 --> 00:27:23,757
Those are their
online handles.

664
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:25,392
Their friends
will confirm it.

665
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,528
A flame war does not
a murderer make.

666
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:30,097
The stuff these guys were
slinging at each other was ugly.

667
00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:32,099
Mo knew they were into hunts,
and so he built one

668
00:27:32,101 --> 00:27:34,034
that would send them to places
where he could kill them.

669
00:27:34,036 --> 00:27:35,469
That's what we're
doing here is

670
00:27:35,471 --> 00:27:36,837
we're just sifting
through all the math

671
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:38,338
he's posted on his blog
over the years,

672
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,840
to see if we could
find his signature

673
00:27:39,842 --> 00:27:41,975
or something that
could identify him.

674
00:27:41,977 --> 00:27:45,279
If two people weren't dead,
we'd probably be having fun.

675
00:27:45,281 --> 00:27:46,747
But still, the
chances that he left

676
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:48,582
something like that
in his math...

677
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,784
If it's there, we'll find it.
In the meantime,

678
00:27:50,786 --> 00:27:52,186
we thought the
police should know

679
00:27:52,188 --> 00:27:53,687
who they're really
dealing with.

680
00:27:53,689 --> 00:27:55,389
<i>I've got to go meet someone</i>

681
00:27:55,391 --> 00:27:56,924
about my other case.

682
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:59,927
You're good to pass all this
along to Marcus? Okay.

683
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:03,030
I must say, I'm surprised you
didn't offer to stay and help.

684
00:28:03,032 --> 00:28:05,265
Mr. Ettinger makes
a compelling case with respect

685
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,067
to Mo Shellshocker's
viability as a suspect.

686
00:28:07,069 --> 00:28:09,002
Mo is a genius.

687
00:28:09,004 --> 00:28:10,637
We're talking off the charts.

688
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:12,139
Leibniz meets Euler meets Gauss.

689
00:28:12,141 --> 00:28:14,108
Huh.
He may have an ego,

690
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,110
but he's not gonna kill
anyone over a few comments.

691
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:18,312
So, while “The League of
Concerned Mathematician”"

692
00:28:18,314 --> 00:28:21,014
chases its tail up there, I
am gonna do the smart thing

693
00:28:21,016 --> 00:28:22,416
and get out of town.

694
00:28:22,418 --> 00:28:24,485
You can let me know
when it all blows over.

695
00:28:24,487 --> 00:28:26,386
You're not going
anywhere, Harlan.

696
00:28:26,388 --> 00:28:29,223
Or should I call you
Mo Shellshocker?

697
00:28:32,728 --> 00:28:34,661
Did you honestly think
I wouldn't recognize

698
00:28:34,663 --> 00:28:36,130
an anagram of my own name?

699
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:40,567
I knew I should've gone
with “Choker Hell Moss”"

700
00:28:40,569 --> 00:28:42,569
But I never thought
that you would see it, okay?

701
00:28:42,571 --> 00:28:44,104
Math is my thing, not yours.

702
00:28:44,106 --> 00:28:46,473
It's my name, Harlan;
that makes it my thing.

703
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,675
It was an homage.

704
00:28:48,677 --> 00:28:50,043
Explain.

705
00:28:50,045 --> 00:28:52,045
Every day, all over the world,

706
00:28:52,047 --> 00:28:54,348
math is used to trick people.

707
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,917
Data dredging to sell
pharmaceuticals.

708
00:28:56,919 --> 00:28:59,720
Publication bias
to justify wars.

709
00:28:59,722 --> 00:29:02,322
In the wrong hands, math can be
manipulated, abused.

710
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:05,425
And I decided to do
something about it.

711
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:09,596
You catch people
who murder other people.

712
00:29:09,598 --> 00:29:11,431
I catch people who murder math.

713
00:29:11,433 --> 00:29:14,568
According to this,
Mo is a wanted man.

714
00:29:17,606 --> 00:29:19,940
Harlan?

715
00:29:19,942 --> 00:29:23,110
The D.O.D. was working
on a new fighter.

716
00:29:23,112 --> 00:29:27,047
Only, I knew that the
performance stats were bogus.

717
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:29,116
A friend of mine found
the internal numbers,

718
00:29:29,118 --> 00:29:31,251
and I sort of published them.

719
00:29:31,253 --> 00:29:33,320
So you put classified
Department of Defense documents

720
00:29:33,322 --> 00:29:34,888
on the Internet.

721
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:36,623
Isn't that what
you would have done?

722
00:29:38,928 --> 00:29:41,562
Fine! I screwed up, okay?

723
00:29:41,564 --> 00:29:43,730
But, hey, that's what I do,
right? I screw up.

724
00:29:43,732 --> 00:29:46,233
If I didn't, then probably you
wouldn't have secretly fired me.

725
00:29:46,235 --> 00:29:47,968
Excuse me?

726
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,403
I know about Indira Patel!

727
00:29:51,006 --> 00:29:53,340
I know you replaced me.

728
00:29:55,144 --> 00:29:58,979
Kitty, I think
we could use some tea.

729
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:04,318
Just tell me.

730
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,253
Tell me what math I got wrong.

731
00:30:06,255 --> 00:30:09,356
Tell me why you didn't let me
make it up to you.

732
00:30:09,358 --> 00:30:12,926
It wasn't the maths, it was you.

733
00:30:14,763 --> 00:30:18,232
Your work was impeccable.

734
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:20,334
And for the most part,
I enjoyed our collaborations.

735
00:30:20,336 --> 00:30:24,838
B-But over time, you just...
you became quite... needy.

736
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,406
What are you talking about?

737
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:29,109
Y-You asked my advice
on-on social matters,

738
00:30:29,111 --> 00:30:32,512
and you even invited me
to a party.

739
00:30:32,514 --> 00:30:34,648
You were my friend.

740
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,416
I was your employer, Harlan.

741
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:37,918
A-And you were my consultant.

742
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,419
One of many.

743
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:43,757
I know that I'm a little
obsessed with what I do.

744
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:46,960
That has always made it hard
to make friends.

745
00:30:46,962 --> 00:30:50,664
And I used to feel pretty bad
about that, and then I met you.

746
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:52,566
And I thought to myself,

747
00:30:52,568 --> 00:30:55,903
hey, if it doesn't bother him,
why should I let it bother me?

748
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:03,810
I got a lot
out of the work that we did.

749
00:31:03,812 --> 00:31:06,146
A lot.

750
00:31:06,148 --> 00:31:11,218
But if someone like you thinks
that I'm a loser, then...

751
00:31:22,564 --> 00:31:24,965
Hey, are we still doing this?

752
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:26,366
Doing what?

753
00:31:26,368 --> 00:31:28,502
Talking about the case.

754
00:31:28,504 --> 00:31:30,070
You're just sitting there.

755
00:31:30,072 --> 00:31:32,105
I'm thinking.

756
00:31:32,107 --> 00:31:34,308
I suspect the silence
is exacerbated

757
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,143
by the nature
of our communication.

758
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:37,811
Yes. Well, I don't
live there anymore.

759
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,713
So, if you want
to talk shop at night,

760
00:31:39,715 --> 00:31:41,515
this is the best I can do.

761
00:31:41,517 --> 00:31:45,252
Keep asking myself:
what did the killer want?

762
00:31:45,254 --> 00:31:48,255
He went to great lengths to lure
brilliant mathematicians

763
00:31:48,257 --> 00:31:49,489
to their deaths.

764
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,525
Winnowed out
the less gifted

765
00:31:51,527 --> 00:31:54,061
by making his problems
more and more complicated.

766
00:31:54,063 --> 00:31:57,597
He had a type, but I still think
he's a serial killer

767
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:59,266
only in the most
technical sense.

768
00:31:59,268 --> 00:32:01,201
He tortured both his victims.

769
00:32:01,203 --> 00:32:02,936
But there's no sign
that he enjoyed it.

770
00:32:02,938 --> 00:32:04,538
The work was
utilitarian,

771
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,740
suggesting it was
less for pleasure

772
00:32:06,742 --> 00:32:10,043
and more for persuasion.

773
00:32:10,045 --> 00:32:11,945
He wanted something.

774
00:32:11,947 --> 00:32:13,714
But what?

775
00:32:13,716 --> 00:32:16,483
Maybe there's a connection
between Wallaczek and Lowenthal

776
00:32:16,485 --> 00:32:18,418
we haven't spotted yet.

777
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,220
Maybe they were working
on a project together,

778
00:32:20,222 --> 00:32:21,822
something that was worth
a lot of money.

779
00:32:21,824 --> 00:32:23,857
There's no way the killer
could have predicted

780
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:26,093
which competitors would make it
to the terminal stage.

781
00:32:26,095 --> 00:32:28,795
That part of the game
was beyond his control.

782
00:32:28,797 --> 00:32:30,664
If it weren't,
he would've been prepared

783
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:33,300
to dispose of a body
the size of Ike Wallaczek's.

784
00:32:33,302 --> 00:32:35,335
So, even if there were a
connection between the victims,

785
00:32:35,337 --> 00:32:37,070
the killer could not
have counted on them

786
00:32:37,072 --> 00:32:38,839
being lured into his trap.

787
00:32:38,841 --> 00:32:41,041
Certainly not
in sequence.

788
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:45,112
His game was, in many respects,
one of chance.

789
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:51,718
Suggesting he knows what
he wants, but not who has it.

790
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,888
Like he was on a puzzle hunt
of his own.

791
00:32:56,825 --> 00:32:58,859
I'm back.

792
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:05,665
I'll set up
downstairs, yeah?

793
00:33:09,138 --> 00:33:11,238
I've been thinking about
what you said earlier.

794
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,740
I've decided to engage her
one more time

795
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:15,609
with regards
to her recuperation.

796
00:33:17,112 --> 00:33:21,815
I doubt she'll listen,
but I'll keep you apprised.

797
00:33:25,954 --> 00:33:27,421
I've been thinking.

798
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:29,623
About?
You. Your history.

799
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:31,825
Your decision
not to seek help.

800
00:33:31,827 --> 00:33:34,594
I think it's
a mistake.

801
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,530
Oh?

802
00:33:36,532 --> 00:33:38,198
I've looked into a number
of support groups.

803
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,633
As you are well aware,

804
00:33:39,635 --> 00:33:41,701
I have benefited greatly
from similar settings.

805
00:33:41,703 --> 00:33:43,270
You have.

806
00:33:43,272 --> 00:33:44,638
The process, I find,

807
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,906
is not unlike
voiding one's bowels...

808
00:33:45,908 --> 00:33:47,808
I'll go.
What?

809
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:49,676
I'll go.
Just get me the details.

810
00:33:52,014 --> 00:33:55,182
I've been thinking, too-- about
your number-cruncher, Harlan.

811
00:33:55,184 --> 00:33:57,017
You think I was
too hard on him.

812
00:33:57,019 --> 00:33:58,685
You will have consultants
of your own one day.

813
00:33:58,687 --> 00:34:01,488
You'll see that they require
management and focus.

814
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:04,124
They are but keys on a keyboard,
and we're the typists.

815
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:06,159
You could've given him
a shoeing for all I care.

816
00:34:06,161 --> 00:34:07,828
No, I'm just saying that

817
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:10,030
some of the stuff he's got
up to, it's quite good.

818
00:34:10,032 --> 00:34:11,698
You should take a look.

819
00:34:13,368 --> 00:34:15,735
You may find a fellow typist.

820
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,076
Hello?

821
00:34:23,078 --> 00:34:25,312
Yeah, I
hear that you and some friends

822
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:27,848
are trying to identify
Mo Shellshocker.

823
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,649
That's right. Who is this?

824
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:32,719
His name is Harlan Emple.

825
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:34,020
You got a pen?

826
00:34:34,022 --> 00:34:36,456
I'll-I'll give you his address.

827
00:34:52,454 --> 00:34:54,020
Harlan.

828
00:34:54,022 --> 00:34:56,356
You can't take a hint, can you?

829
00:34:56,358 --> 00:34:57,657
I got your text messages.

830
00:34:57,659 --> 00:34:58,958
I don't want to see you
right now.

831
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,827
So if you came here
to apologize...

832
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:03,363
Actually, I came here
to spare you an agonizing death.

833
00:35:04,299 --> 00:35:05,832
Can I come in?

834
00:35:05,834 --> 00:35:08,301
I was puzzling earlier

835
00:35:08,303 --> 00:35:12,038
as to why the killer went
to such specific lengths.

836
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,606
What did he want?

837
00:35:13,608 --> 00:35:15,809
And then Watson,
quite by accident,

838
00:35:15,811 --> 00:35:17,410
she made a most
compelling analogy.

839
00:35:17,412 --> 00:35:20,080
She said it was as if he
was on a hunt of his own.

840
00:35:20,082 --> 00:35:22,615
Duh. He was hunting
mathematicians.

841
00:35:22,617 --> 00:35:23,783
No, he wasn't.

842
00:35:23,785 --> 00:35:25,151
He was hunting<i> a</i> mathematician.

843
00:35:25,153 --> 00:35:26,619
One.

844
00:35:26,621 --> 00:35:29,389
A man who had concealed
his identity not only

845
00:35:29,391 --> 00:35:31,191
from the mathematics
community at large,

846
00:35:31,193 --> 00:35:32,859
but also from the FBI.

847
00:35:32,861 --> 00:35:35,395
A “crusader,”
you might call him.

848
00:35:35,397 --> 00:35:36,763
Wait a minute.

849
00:35:36,765 --> 00:35:38,731
Are you saying that
this was all about me?

850
00:35:53,448 --> 00:35:56,449
<i> Unfortunately, emulating</i>
<i>the work of people like me</i>

851
00:35:56,451 --> 00:35:59,018
<i>is not without risks.</i>

852
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,320
Creates enemies.

853
00:36:00,322 --> 00:36:02,889
I knew it was the government.

854
00:36:02,891 --> 00:36:04,424
It was a lottery winner.

855
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,260
Little over a year ago,

856
00:36:07,262 --> 00:36:09,529
you started a series of blogs
where you exposed the flaws

857
00:36:09,531 --> 00:36:11,664
in certain scratch card
lottery games.

858
00:36:11,666 --> 00:36:13,766
Tickets like this one.

859
00:36:13,768 --> 00:36:15,802
I wrote about
baited hook games.

860
00:36:15,804 --> 00:36:17,971
Games where the numbers
are printed on the front.

861
00:36:17,973 --> 00:36:20,707
Scratch off the hidden numbers,
hope for a match.

862
00:36:20,709 --> 00:36:23,309
Only, you proved that with
careful mathematical analysis

863
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:25,512
of the visible numbers,
you could predict

864
00:36:25,514 --> 00:36:28,381
which tickets were winners
80% of the time.

865
00:36:28,383 --> 00:36:29,682
If you had exploited

866
00:36:29,684 --> 00:36:32,085
this flaw,
rather than exposing it,

867
00:36:32,087 --> 00:36:33,520
you could have made millions.

868
00:36:33,522 --> 00:36:36,022
Well... sure.
But that would been cheating.

869
00:36:36,024 --> 00:36:37,157
Right.

870
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:38,825
So imagine
for a moment

871
00:36:38,827 --> 00:36:41,060
that you are a less
honest mathematician.

872
00:36:41,062 --> 00:36:42,495
Right?

873
00:36:42,497 --> 00:36:44,063
You've been taking
advantage of these games

874
00:36:44,065 --> 00:36:47,967
for a couple of years to
amass a small fortune.

875
00:36:47,969 --> 00:36:49,502
And then “Mo"
comes along.

876
00:36:49,504 --> 00:36:51,971
He starts exposing
the broken games.

877
00:36:51,973 --> 00:36:54,340
State lottery commissions
shut them down.

878
00:36:54,342 --> 00:36:56,976
The exploitable
games dry up.

879
00:36:56,978 --> 00:37:00,613
Now, if you were a
psychopathic lottery cheat,

880
00:37:00,615 --> 00:37:02,582
how do you fix that?

881
00:37:02,584 --> 00:37:04,484
You kill Mo.

882
00:37:04,486 --> 00:37:07,253
<i>Unfortunately, Mo is elusive.</i>

883
00:37:07,255 --> 00:37:08,821
<i>Anonymous.</i>

884
00:37:08,823 --> 00:37:11,224
The only thing
he knew about him for sure

885
00:37:11,226 --> 00:37:14,394
was that he could not resist
a puzzle hunt.

886
00:37:14,396 --> 00:37:17,130
Now, if you were smart enough
to identify

887
00:37:17,132 --> 00:37:19,399
and take advantage of
broken lottery games...

888
00:37:19,401 --> 00:37:21,868
Then I'm smart enough
to design a puzzle hunt.

889
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:25,338
This plan was not
without its flaws.

890
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:28,775
Once a competitor
reached the terminal stage,

891
00:37:28,777 --> 00:37:32,745
the killer could not be certain
that he'd trapped Mo, could he?

892
00:37:32,747 --> 00:37:34,480
So he tortured them.

893
00:37:34,482 --> 00:37:37,083
I submit he forced them to
log on to Mo's Web site,

894
00:37:37,085 --> 00:37:39,686
and when they failed...

895
00:37:41,323 --> 00:37:42,755
After two murders,

896
00:37:42,757 --> 00:37:44,290
the game was compromised.

897
00:37:44,292 --> 00:37:46,192
So the killer devises
a Plan “B.”

898
00:37:46,194 --> 00:37:47,460
He tricks

899
00:37:47,462 --> 00:37:49,229
a group of his peers

900
00:37:49,231 --> 00:37:51,097
into helping search
for an alternative means

901
00:37:51,099 --> 00:37:53,032
of identifying Mo.

902
00:37:56,504 --> 00:37:58,438
You're talking about that guy.

903
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,906
The one with the penthouse.

904
00:37:59,908 --> 00:38:02,742
<i>Paul?</i>

905
00:38:02,744 --> 00:38:05,044
Lottery winners
are public record.

906
00:38:05,046 --> 00:38:07,814
So when I searched for
the names of repeat winners

907
00:38:07,816 --> 00:38:09,482
in the dates prior
to your posts...

908
00:38:09,484 --> 00:38:11,317
I can't believe
I drank his water.

909
00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:12,685
I called him.

910
00:38:12,687 --> 00:38:14,654
I identified you as Mo.

911
00:38:14,656 --> 00:38:16,122
And I gave him your address.

912
00:38:16,124 --> 00:38:17,590
You what?!

913
00:38:21,129 --> 00:38:23,062
Drop your weapon!

914
00:38:23,064 --> 00:38:24,597
<i>I did not, however, give him</i>

915
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:25,965
<i>the correct apartment number.</i>

916
00:38:25,967 --> 00:38:28,334
He was arrested
a little over an hour ago.

917
00:38:30,739 --> 00:38:31,871
Tried to call you to
tell you, but, um...

918
00:38:31,873 --> 00:38:33,539
But I was ignoring you.

919
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:35,008
Yes, you were ignoring me.

920
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,209
Look, you know

921
00:38:36,211 --> 00:38:37,377
that I'm still screwed, right?

922
00:38:37,379 --> 00:38:39,279
You told him that I'm Mo.

923
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:42,115
He's gonna tell the police,
they're gonna tell the FBI...

924
00:38:42,117 --> 00:38:43,516
The NYPD is under
the impression

925
00:38:43,518 --> 00:38:45,385
that I lied about
your connection to Mo

926
00:38:45,387 --> 00:38:47,920
in order to draw
Mr. Ettinger out.

927
00:38:47,922 --> 00:38:49,555
As far as the
FBI goes, well,

928
00:38:49,557 --> 00:38:51,958
I've got some associates
who have created a trail

929
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,860
which will
strongly suggest that Mo

930
00:38:53,862 --> 00:38:55,728
is a cyber-terrorist
I became aware of

931
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:58,197
whilst working for, um...

932
00:38:58,199 --> 00:38:59,766
queen and country.

933
00:38:59,768 --> 00:39:02,135
Your secret's
quite safe.

934
00:39:02,137 --> 00:39:03,903
Thanks.

935
00:39:06,508 --> 00:39:09,776
My reasons for preserving you
are entirely selfish, Harlan.

936
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:13,279
You are a tremendous asset.

937
00:39:13,281 --> 00:39:15,815
I have little doubt

938
00:39:15,817 --> 00:39:19,118
I will need your help again
in the future.

939
00:39:26,461 --> 00:39:28,528
Me or him?

940
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:29,996
You.

941
00:39:29,998 --> 00:39:31,798
I have an update on
that real estate flipper.

942
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,433
I thought you might
want to know.

943
00:39:39,274 --> 00:39:41,908
I tracked down the truck rental
receipts to get her name.

944
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,142
Valerie Cork.

945
00:39:43,144 --> 00:39:44,911
She's an art authenticator.

946
00:39:44,913 --> 00:39:46,779
And that crate you saw?

947
00:39:46,781 --> 00:39:48,414
There was
something called

948
00:39:48,416 --> 00:39:50,683
a scanning fluorescence
spectrometry machine inside.

949
00:39:50,685 --> 00:39:52,251
They're used...
To find paintings

950
00:39:52,253 --> 00:39:53,553
underneath other paintings.

951
00:39:53,555 --> 00:39:55,288
So it turns out
that the building

952
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:56,689
Chad Keswick was looking to buy

953
00:39:56,691 --> 00:39:59,025
was leased by the WPA
during the Depression.

954
00:39:59,027 --> 00:40:00,927
They commissioned a
mural for the lobby.

955
00:40:00,929 --> 00:40:03,329
The artist was a
notorious communist,

956
00:40:03,331 --> 00:40:05,365
so when the property passed
into private hands in the '50s,

957
00:40:05,367 --> 00:40:06,999
the new owners
had it painted over.

958
00:40:07,001 --> 00:40:08,735
But it was still there,
under the paint.

959
00:40:08,737 --> 00:40:11,037
A lost work by Diego Rivera.

960
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:13,473
It's worth ten times
the price of the building.

961
00:40:14,676 --> 00:40:17,043
I was hoping to leak
the truth to the<i> Times.</i>

962
00:40:18,113 --> 00:40:20,046
I promised you a cut of my fee.

963
00:40:20,048 --> 00:40:22,148
But I'm pretty sure
the mural's gonna end up

964
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:24,384
in the hands of
a historical trust.

965
00:40:24,386 --> 00:40:26,352
I'd feel obligated
to refund my client,

966
00:40:26,354 --> 00:40:28,388
which means you'd get
a cut of nothing.

967
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:31,457
That works for me.

968
00:40:31,459 --> 00:40:33,493
Okay.

969
00:40:35,463 --> 00:40:37,397
I think you should know

970
00:40:37,399 --> 00:40:39,732
that I am going
to a meeting tonight.

971
00:40:41,803 --> 00:40:45,505
One of those
support groups for...

972
00:40:45,507 --> 00:40:47,340
people like me.

973
00:40:47,342 --> 00:40:49,876
It was, uh, Sherlock's idea.

974
00:40:49,878 --> 00:40:51,644
That's great.

975
00:40:51,646 --> 00:40:53,446
I know you put him up to it.

976
00:40:53,448 --> 00:40:55,381
We talked.

977
00:40:57,552 --> 00:41:00,219
When he first approached me
in London,

978
00:41:00,221 --> 00:41:03,556
I was...

979
00:41:03,558 --> 00:41:05,558
in a bad way.

980
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,227
And I had been for a while.

981
00:41:08,229 --> 00:41:11,130
But then,
when he talked about

982
00:41:11,132 --> 00:41:12,365
the work that he did,

983
00:41:12,367 --> 00:41:16,035
about the things
that he saw in me...

984
00:41:18,406 --> 00:41:19,739
I want it.

985
00:41:19,741 --> 00:41:21,874
I want every bit
of what's he offered me,

986
00:41:21,876 --> 00:41:23,843
of what he offered you, but...

987
00:41:23,845 --> 00:41:26,212
if I've learned one thing
over the last few weeks,

988
00:41:26,214 --> 00:41:28,047
it's that he can't pull it off.

989
00:41:28,049 --> 00:41:29,682
Not by himself, anyway.

990
00:41:31,586 --> 00:41:34,153
And if I'm gonna get
what I want,

991
00:41:34,155 --> 00:41:37,690
then I'm going to need
your help, too.

992
00:41:40,361 --> 00:41:42,829
I still think
the meetings are bollocks,

993
00:41:42,831 --> 00:41:44,931
but you say they're important.

994
00:41:44,933 --> 00:41:47,967
They matter to you, so...

995
00:41:47,969 --> 00:41:49,735
What do you say, Watson?

996
00:41:49,737 --> 00:41:52,071
Will you help me?

997
00:41:56,277 --> 00:41:58,244
I don't know how it happened.

998
00:41:58,246 --> 00:42:01,547
It just... hit me.

999
00:42:01,549 --> 00:42:03,983
Like a truck, out of nowhere.

1000
00:42:04,853 --> 00:42:07,753
Work is good.

1001
00:42:07,755 --> 00:42:09,755
I have friends.

1002
00:42:09,757 --> 00:42:13,092
I'm in a
relationship.

1003
00:42:13,094 --> 00:42:16,896
Somewhere along
the way, somehow,

1004
00:42:16,898 --> 00:42:19,732
I stopped being a victim

1005
00:42:19,734 --> 00:42:22,602
and became a survivor.

1006
00:42:22,604 --> 00:42:25,705
So, I guess all I'm saying is,
there's hope.

1007
00:42:26,357 --> 00:42:31,686
Do the work. Love yourself.
There's hope.

<i>Previously on</i> Elementary...

2
00:00:03,422 --> 00:00:04,761
If you're looking for Sherlock,
he's downstairs.

3
00:00:04,785 --> 00:00:05,841
Okay.

4
00:00:05,842 --> 00:00:07,541
<i>His name is Harlan Emple.</i>

5
00:00:07,543 --> 00:00:09,176
<i>He is the Rachel P. Hanson</i>
<i>Professor</i>

6
00:00:09,178 --> 00:00:11,301
for Applied Mathematics
at Columbia University.

7
00:00:11,301 --> 00:00:14,502
What I don't get is
why he isn't wearing a shirt.

8
00:00:14,504 --> 00:00:17,372
He doesn't like anything to come
between him and the numbers.

9
00:00:17,374 --> 00:00:18,415
What is it?

10
00:00:18,438 --> 00:00:20,274
The answers to your questions
about Kitty.

11
00:00:20,276 --> 00:00:22,710
The truth is she was a
victim of a horrific crime.

12
00:00:22,712 --> 00:00:24,646
<i>After you left last night,</i>

13
00:00:24,648 --> 00:00:26,848
Sherlock gave me an envelope.

14
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,249
Sherlock keeps saying

15
00:00:28,251 --> 00:00:30,385
that I need to get
a better sense of you,

16
00:00:30,387 --> 00:00:33,021
and maybe that will give you
a better sense of me.

17
00:00:42,065 --> 00:00:43,065
It's open.

18
00:00:47,637 --> 00:00:49,003
It's nothing.

19
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:50,872
It's Sherlock and
one of his experts.

20
00:00:50,874 --> 00:00:52,006
Which one?

21
00:00:52,008 --> 00:00:53,241
Phillip something.

22
00:00:53,243 --> 00:00:54,575
Must be new.

23
00:00:54,577 --> 00:00:57,445
He's a knife-thrower.

24
00:00:57,447 --> 00:00:58,913
Why does Sherlock have
a knife-thrower?

25
00:00:58,915 --> 00:01:00,748
He got bored the other day,

26
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,185
started looking into this, uh,
circus accident from the '30s.

27
00:01:04,187 --> 00:01:07,922
The Great Galardo perforated one
of his assistants during an act,

28
00:01:07,924 --> 00:01:09,924
except Sherlock thinks
the blade was thrown

29
00:01:09,926 --> 00:01:11,492
by somebody in the stands,
not Galardo.

30
00:01:11,494 --> 00:01:15,096
Phillip, as far as I
can tell, disagrees.

31
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:18,900
It can't be done, okay?

32
00:01:18,902 --> 00:01:19,934
It was done.

33
00:01:19,936 --> 00:01:21,335
You're wrong.

34
00:01:21,337 --> 00:01:23,538
Nobody can chuck
a knife that far.

35
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,239
What's this?

36
00:01:25,241 --> 00:01:26,207
You're...

37
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:27,209
Not here.

38
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,509
I'm not here.

39
00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:29,711
Remember that, okay?

40
00:01:29,713 --> 00:01:31,279
Oh, yes. Heaven
forfend your work

41
00:01:31,281 --> 00:01:33,247
with me should endanger
your precious day job.

42
00:01:33,249 --> 00:01:35,116
You throw knives?

43
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,252
You know, it was supposed
to be just you here.

44
00:01:38,254 --> 00:01:41,355
Phillip is arguably the greatest
knife-thrower in the world.

45
00:01:41,357 --> 00:01:42,790
Has been for decades.

46
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:43,925
Only, there's little money

47
00:01:43,927 --> 00:01:45,193
to be made
in the impalement arts.

48
00:01:45,195 --> 00:01:46,494
So, as a youth, he turned

49
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,563
to what you Americans
term “football”"

50
00:01:48,565 --> 00:01:50,131
Is this a joke?

51
00:01:53,837 --> 00:01:55,002
Phillip, head
and heart.

52
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:56,904
Come on.
Head and heart.

53
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:06,814
Can I go?

54
00:02:06,816 --> 00:02:09,484
Yeah.

55
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,489
15 years he spent throwing
that misshapen ball around.

56
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:16,057
15 years.

57
00:02:16,059 --> 00:02:18,259
When I think of the acclaim
he could have brought

58
00:02:18,261 --> 00:02:20,828
to competitive blade slinging.

59
00:02:27,237 --> 00:02:29,036
You're following me,
Watson.

60
00:02:29,038 --> 00:02:30,338
I don't like it.

61
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,740
I want you to help
me with something.

62
00:02:32,742 --> 00:02:33,908
This is Chad Keswick.

63
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,976
He buys distressed
buildings,

64
00:02:34,978 --> 00:02:36,210
paints, spackles,

65
00:02:36,212 --> 00:02:37,645
and then flips them
for quick money.

66
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:39,180
Who'd he kill?
No one.

67
00:02:39,182 --> 00:02:41,315
I was hired by one of
his rivals to find out

68
00:02:41,317 --> 00:02:43,017
why he's been circling
this old office building

69
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:44,218
in Jamaica, Queens.

70
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,586
She wants to know
why he thinks

71
00:02:45,588 --> 00:02:47,355
the building is
a good investment.

72
00:02:47,357 --> 00:02:49,590
Is there a crime in there,
something worth investigating?

73
00:02:49,592 --> 00:02:50,925
Well, I've been
shadowing Keswick,

74
00:02:50,927 --> 00:02:52,593
but yesterday I think
he noticed me.

75
00:02:52,595 --> 00:02:54,595
I want to switch
up the tail.

76
00:02:54,597 --> 00:02:57,231
You followed me for over
a week before I noticed you.

77
00:02:57,233 --> 00:02:59,033
Help me out, and I'll
cut you in on my fee.

78
00:02:59,035 --> 00:03:02,003
I don't work for you,
I work for Sherlock.

79
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:03,437
I worked for him, too.

80
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,773
And, in my experience,
he was always supportive

81
00:03:05,775 --> 00:03:07,942
of taking on work
outside the partnership.

82
00:03:07,944 --> 00:03:10,912
Sorry, it's not my cup of tea.

83
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:33,034
Hello, Portal Ten.

84
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,247
I'm here, Belphegor.

85
00:03:46,249 --> 00:03:49,784
So where is the next clue?

Look, for the last time,
I was playing a game!

90
00:04:45,356 --> 00:04:47,456
Yeah, you called it
a puzzle hunt.

91
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,491
Belphegor's Prime.

92
00:04:50,761 --> 00:04:53,262
Think Cicada 3301
or Octorine's Challenge.

93
00:04:54,365 --> 00:04:55,631
They're math games.

94
00:04:55,633 --> 00:04:56,865
Math-- maybe you've heard of it.

95
00:04:56,867 --> 00:04:58,333
I've got some math for you.

96
00:04:58,335 --> 00:05:00,335
One dead guy
plus one live guy

97
00:05:00,337 --> 00:05:02,104
found in the same
deserted factory.

98
00:05:02,106 --> 00:05:06,108
I was not “found” there;
I am the one who called 911.

99
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,310
I was waiting there
for the police.

100
00:05:08,312 --> 00:05:09,745
Mr. Emple,

101
00:05:09,747 --> 00:05:11,613
we're just trying
to do our jobs, all right?

102
00:05:11,615 --> 00:05:13,048
First officers
on the scene described you

103
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,516
as “extremely agitated.”

104
00:05:14,518 --> 00:05:15,984
Well, of course
I was agitated.

105
00:05:15,986 --> 00:05:18,754
I had just found
a dead guy in mothballs!

106
00:05:18,756 --> 00:05:21,790
And did I mention that I have
not slept in almost two days?

107
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:23,358
Because of the math game.

108
00:05:24,762 --> 00:05:26,195
Can I borrow those?

109
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:31,100
This...

110
00:05:31,102 --> 00:05:33,302
is Belphegor's Prime, okay?

111
00:05:33,304 --> 00:05:35,304
It's a numeric palindrome.

112
00:05:35,306 --> 00:05:40,776
It's 666 bookended by 13 zeroes
and then bracketed with ones.

113
00:05:40,778 --> 00:05:43,846
Named for the demon Belphegor
who was a prince of hell.

114
00:05:43,848 --> 00:05:46,448
The first clue for the hunt
started making the rounds

115
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,883
a few months ago.

116
00:05:47,885 --> 00:05:49,651
It was a JPEG with two numbers
hidden in it.

117
00:05:49,653 --> 00:05:51,453
You divide those numbers
by Belphegor's Prime,

118
00:05:51,455 --> 00:05:54,890
and you get the GPS coordinates
for a restroom at the Bronx Zoo.

119
00:05:54,892 --> 00:05:56,959
You go to the restroom,
you find a phone number.

120
00:05:56,961 --> 00:05:58,927
You send a text to the number,
you get the next clue.

121
00:05:58,929 --> 00:05:59,962
Which is another math problem.

122
00:05:59,964 --> 00:06:00,929
Exactly.

123
00:06:00,931 --> 00:06:02,397
Only, this one is harder.

124
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,099
And that's how it works.

125
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:05,934
You know, but for
each one that you solve,

126
00:06:05,936 --> 00:06:08,103
you get a new set
of GPS coordinates.

127
00:06:08,105 --> 00:06:11,473
And that means that you've
completed a stage, or a portal.

128
00:06:11,475 --> 00:06:13,509
And last night,
I was on Portal Ten.

129
00:06:13,511 --> 00:06:15,711
And...

130
00:06:17,014 --> 00:06:18,313
You know what?

131
00:06:18,315 --> 00:06:20,015
I want to talk
to Sherlock and Joan.

132
00:06:20,017 --> 00:06:21,917
Look, Mr. Emple...
No, I'm sorry.

133
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,019
I told the police down
at the factory that I know them.

134
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:25,287
Isn't that the whole reason

135
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:26,922
that I was brought here
to this squad?

136
00:06:26,924 --> 00:06:30,392
I-I am not saying another word
until they are here.

137
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:35,264
Harlan Emple is
indeed an acquaintance.

138
00:06:35,266 --> 00:06:37,733
He is, in point of fact,
one of my “irregulars.”

139
00:06:37,735 --> 00:06:38,801
One of your what?

140
00:06:38,803 --> 00:06:40,302
Irregulars.

141
00:06:40,304 --> 00:06:41,770
I'm your consultant, Captain;
they are mine.

142
00:06:41,772 --> 00:06:43,572
They're a handful
of experts I turn to

143
00:06:43,574 --> 00:06:46,108
when I encounter problems which
are beyond my pool of knowledge.

144
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,810
Harlan is
a brilliant mathematician.

145
00:06:47,812 --> 00:06:49,778
And on the handful of occasions
I have tackled a case

146
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,046
which pertained
to mathematics...

147
00:06:51,048 --> 00:06:53,182
He helped you out.
Well, the good news

148
00:06:53,184 --> 00:06:56,018
for him is the preliminary
autopsy report just came in

149
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,252
before you got here.

150
00:06:57,254 --> 00:06:59,021
And the M.E. puts
the time of death

151
00:06:59,023 --> 00:07:00,989
between 4:00 and
6:00 p.m. last night.

152
00:07:00,991 --> 00:07:02,124
Mr. Emple was teaching

153
00:07:02,126 --> 00:07:03,358
a class at Columbia.

154
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,394
So the victim is
yet to be identified?

155
00:07:05,396 --> 00:07:07,663
No I.D., no phone.

156
00:07:07,665 --> 00:07:09,865
First detective on the scene
liked it for a mob hit,

157
00:07:09,867 --> 00:07:11,500
so while we're
running the prints,

158
00:07:11,502 --> 00:07:13,602
he's showing the vic's
face around OCID.

159
00:07:13,604 --> 00:07:16,839
Marcus here was about to walk
the scene with Mr. Emple.

160
00:07:16,841 --> 00:07:18,774
You're here now;
you might as well tag along.

161
00:07:18,776 --> 00:07:21,009
Actually, Captain,
I'm quite busy today.

162
00:07:21,011 --> 00:07:22,978
This is a John Doe,
and we got nothing.

163
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,247
And, like you just said,
you're my consultant.

164
00:07:25,249 --> 00:07:26,748
So, go consult.

165
00:07:29,787 --> 00:07:30,986
Watson.

166
00:07:30,988 --> 00:07:32,588
Um, he's your friend.

167
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,523
Actually, Kitty is
otherwise engaged,

168
00:07:34,525 --> 00:07:37,426
and he did actually help both
of us with a case last year.

169
00:07:37,428 --> 00:07:38,493
Did he not?

170
00:07:40,865 --> 00:07:44,099
Have I told you
how good it is to see you?

171
00:07:44,101 --> 00:07:45,367
Yes, you have.
Three times.

172
00:07:45,369 --> 00:07:46,468
Well, it is.

173
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,636
Hey, lousy circumstances.

174
00:07:47,638 --> 00:07:49,371
But, uh, hey...

175
00:07:49,373 --> 00:07:51,740
I heard from your boss that you
just, uh, got back from London.

176
00:07:51,742 --> 00:07:53,308
Were you working
a case or...?

177
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,576
No, I moved back there.

178
00:07:54,578 --> 00:07:55,677
You mean<i> moved,</i> moved?

179
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:56,845
Is there another
definition?

180
00:07:56,847 --> 00:07:58,513
I was there for
eight months,

181
00:07:58,515 --> 00:08:00,883
and had a change of heart
and returned to New York.

182
00:08:00,885 --> 00:08:02,517
So, you moved to London,
and you didn't, uh...

183
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,086
You know what?
Doesn't even matter.

184
00:08:04,088 --> 00:08:05,387
The point is you're back!

185
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:07,389
Mr. Emple.
Uh, duty calls.

186
00:08:07,391 --> 00:08:09,024
Yeah.

187
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:18,634
It's interesting.

188
00:08:18,636 --> 00:08:20,068
Mothballs are interesting?

189
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,070
They were taken from
that cabinet over there.

190
00:08:22,072 --> 00:08:25,941
Obviously, to cover the smell
of John Doe's decay.

191
00:08:25,943 --> 00:08:28,043
The killer didn't
bring them with him.

192
00:08:28,045 --> 00:08:31,179
Perhaps leaving the body here
was not part of his plan, hmm?

193
00:08:32,983 --> 00:08:36,018
Doe was shot in the foot
first and then the knee.

194
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,453
Either those were
two really bad misses or...

195
00:08:38,455 --> 00:08:41,256
Or the killer was torturing him.

196
00:08:41,258 --> 00:08:43,892
This doesn't seem like anything
you can't handle on your own.

197
00:08:43,894 --> 00:08:45,994
So you want to tell me why you
really asked me to come here?

198
00:08:45,996 --> 00:08:48,363
“This doesn't seem like anything
you can't handle on your own.”

199
00:08:48,365 --> 00:08:49,765
That's funny.

200
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:51,566
That's exactly what
I would have said

201
00:08:51,568 --> 00:08:53,602
had I been present when you
asked Kitty for her assistance

202
00:08:53,604 --> 00:08:54,937
with your tawdry side job.

203
00:08:54,939 --> 00:08:57,372
“Tawdry”?
I wanted you to know I approve.

204
00:08:57,374 --> 00:08:59,007
Of what?

205
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:01,376
Your agenda
with regards to Kitty.

206
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:03,078
Several days ago,
I gave you her file.

207
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,913
And then you show up at
the brownstone yesterday,

208
00:09:04,915 --> 00:09:06,515
and you invite her
into an investigation.

209
00:09:06,517 --> 00:09:08,183
Coincidence? No, I think not.

210
00:09:08,185 --> 00:09:11,320
You feel for her.
And now you wish to engage.

211
00:09:11,322 --> 00:09:13,956
It's not an outcome
I would have predicted, no.

212
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,458
But it is one
I approve of, yeah.

213
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,193
She could learn
a great deal from you,

214
00:09:18,195 --> 00:09:20,228
especially with regards
to how to get the most

215
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,864
from my tutelage.

216
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:25,734
So, I've already dispatched her
to, uh, follow your Mr. Keswick.

217
00:09:25,736 --> 00:09:27,836
But that's not
what I actually...

218
00:09:27,838 --> 00:09:29,404
Harlan!

219
00:09:30,741 --> 00:09:33,075
You came here to retrieve
a phone number, did you not?

220
00:09:33,077 --> 00:09:34,609
You would send a text,
and then receive

221
00:09:34,611 --> 00:09:36,845
the next clue in the game
that you were playing.

222
00:09:36,847 --> 00:09:38,747
Yeah, but I didn't find it.

223
00:09:38,749 --> 00:09:40,048
Not that I kept looking

224
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,250
after the dead guy
fell out of the locker.

225
00:09:42,252 --> 00:09:44,052
Yeah, CSU didn't find
any number either.

226
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:46,154
Probably because
it's under that paint.

227
00:09:46,156 --> 00:09:48,190
It's fresh.

228
00:09:48,192 --> 00:09:49,891
Applied in the last

229
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:52,694
24 hours.

230
00:09:52,696 --> 00:09:54,696
Right after John Doe's murder,
I'd wager.

231
00:09:54,698 --> 00:09:57,099
You don't think
this was a mob hit?

232
00:09:57,101 --> 00:09:59,101
Doe and the killer were
playing the game, too.

233
00:09:59,103 --> 00:10:01,203
The killer shot Doe and
then covered up the number

234
00:10:01,205 --> 00:10:02,704
so no one else could use it.

235
00:10:02,706 --> 00:10:04,806
What's the prize
in your little contest?

236
00:10:04,808 --> 00:10:07,576
Well, I'm doing it
mostly for the math.

237
00:10:07,578 --> 00:10:11,480
But, uh, $1,707,071.

238
00:10:11,482 --> 00:10:13,882
It's another
palindromic prime.

239
00:10:13,884 --> 00:10:17,152
Did I not mention the
money at the station?

240
00:10:17,154 --> 00:10:18,587
Who the hell can afford

241
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:20,655
that kind of payout
for a puzzle hunt?

242
00:10:20,657 --> 00:10:22,124
Well, most people
think it's CAML.

243
00:10:22,126 --> 00:10:24,593
The Center for Applied
Mathematics and Logic.

244
00:10:24,595 --> 00:10:26,094
It's located
in Ramapo...

245
00:10:26,096 --> 00:10:27,729
Wait, most people
“think” it's them?

246
00:10:27,731 --> 00:10:29,331
Well, hunts like these,

247
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,266
the organizers are
almost always anonymous.

248
00:10:31,268 --> 00:10:32,401
It's S.O.P.

249
00:10:32,403 --> 00:10:34,302
What about the
contestants?

250
00:10:34,304 --> 00:10:37,005
Is anonymity
also S.O.P.?

251
00:10:37,007 --> 00:10:39,207
For the most part, yeah.

252
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:43,078
But, guys, math peeps
are my peeps, okay?

253
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,314
It's, uh, like
a community, sort of.

254
00:10:46,316 --> 00:10:48,984
I can think of ten
or 12 other people

255
00:10:48,986 --> 00:10:50,018
who were probably competing.

256
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,186
Would that help?

257
00:10:53,157 --> 00:10:55,223
No.

258
00:10:55,225 --> 00:10:58,026
I'm sorry, I don't know him.

259
00:10:58,028 --> 00:11:00,862
But you admit you were
competing in Belphegor's Prime.

260
00:11:00,864 --> 00:11:02,197
I do.

261
00:11:04,835 --> 00:11:05,934
Pepe!

262
00:11:08,172 --> 00:11:10,439
Sorry. He doesn't
like strangers.

263
00:11:12,109 --> 00:11:14,443
Give him one of these.

264
00:11:14,445 --> 00:11:16,111
Get on his good side.

265
00:11:24,288 --> 00:11:26,354
What are you doing?

266
00:11:28,225 --> 00:11:30,725
I'm just verifying that
you've been lying to us.

267
00:11:30,727 --> 00:11:33,895
You did know the
dead man, did you not?

268
00:11:33,897 --> 00:11:36,998
I reviewed his personal
effects at the morgue earlier.

269
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,034
The coroner reported finding
crumbs in one of his pockets.

270
00:11:39,036 --> 00:11:40,036
I tasted one.

271
00:11:40,037 --> 00:11:41,269
Why would you...?

272
00:11:41,271 --> 00:11:42,771
At first, I thought
they were from

273
00:11:42,773 --> 00:11:44,439
a particularly rancid
brand of cheese,

274
00:11:44,441 --> 00:11:47,609
but, no... they're from
one of Pepe's treats.

275
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:49,277
Homemade?

276
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,481
Harlan was able to give us
the names of nine other people

277
00:11:52,483 --> 00:11:54,149
he believed to be
other competitors.

278
00:11:54,151 --> 00:11:55,984
Our colleagues are
investigating them as we speak,

279
00:11:55,986 --> 00:11:57,919
but I'll quite happily
recommend that the NYPD

280
00:11:57,921 --> 00:12:00,222
focus its attention
entirely on you.

281
00:12:04,128 --> 00:12:06,428
His name was Ike Walaczek.

282
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,231
In another lifetime,
he was my boyfriend.

283
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:10,866
And what of
this lifetime?

284
00:12:10,868 --> 00:12:12,701
We were working together.

285
00:12:12,703 --> 00:12:14,769
On Belphegor's.
What?!

286
00:12:14,771 --> 00:12:16,705
He was a numerical analyst
at the Tory Foundation.

287
00:12:16,707 --> 00:12:17,873
I work mostly in combinatorics.

288
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,307
I thought we would make
a good team.

289
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:20,742
But there aren't
supposed to be teams.

290
00:12:20,744 --> 00:12:22,711
Not in a puzzle hunt.
It's bad form.

291
00:12:22,713 --> 00:12:23,713
Harlan...

292
00:12:23,714 --> 00:12:25,514
I'm just saying...

293
00:12:25,516 --> 00:12:27,315
My husband
wouldn't understand,

294
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:30,385
so I decided I wouldn't tell him
until after we won the money.

295
00:12:30,387 --> 00:12:33,121
A team-- so that's how
you got there before me.

296
00:12:33,123 --> 00:12:34,489
I wasn't there.

297
00:12:34,491 --> 00:12:36,258
Tom and I were out of town
until this morning.

298
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,126
His cousin
was getting married in Hawaii.

299
00:12:38,128 --> 00:12:40,662
That's why Ike went
to the coordinates by himself.

300
00:12:40,664 --> 00:12:42,097
Because I couldn't.

301
00:12:44,268 --> 00:12:46,601
These are pictures I took.

302
00:12:46,603 --> 00:12:49,337
Check the dates.

303
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:51,506
You gave the police
nine other names?

304
00:12:51,508 --> 00:12:53,408
People you thought
were competing?

305
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,776
I've got 16.

306
00:12:54,778 --> 00:12:56,311
And I know they were competing.

307
00:12:58,448 --> 00:13:01,249
He talked to her
outside the Jamaica property

308
00:13:01,251 --> 00:13:05,720
for about 20 minutes,
and then this truck rolled up.

309
00:13:05,722 --> 00:13:07,822
Any idea what's
inside the crate?

310
00:13:07,824 --> 00:13:09,024
Nope.

311
00:13:09,026 --> 00:13:10,392
I can't identify
the woman either.

312
00:13:10,394 --> 00:13:12,260
Everything about her
said money though.

313
00:13:12,262 --> 00:13:15,363
She, Keswick
and the mystery box

314
00:13:15,365 --> 00:13:17,732
stayed inside the building
for about three hours,

315
00:13:17,734 --> 00:13:20,001
and then off they went.

316
00:13:20,904 --> 00:13:22,170
Good.

317
00:13:22,172 --> 00:13:23,872
Okay.

318
00:13:23,874 --> 00:13:26,074
You know where
to send the check.

319
00:13:26,076 --> 00:13:30,145
You haven't asked me about
the file Sherlock gave me.

320
00:13:30,147 --> 00:13:32,080
Why would I?

321
00:13:32,082 --> 00:13:36,184
You said it would give me
a better sense of you-- it did.

322
00:13:37,588 --> 00:13:40,155
That's why you asked
for my help.

323
00:13:40,157 --> 00:13:41,990
Because you felt sorry for me.

324
00:13:41,992 --> 00:13:44,226
No.

325
00:13:44,228 --> 00:13:46,194
You just don't seem interested
in anything

326
00:13:46,196 --> 00:13:48,063
outside of becoming
a detective.

327
00:13:48,065 --> 00:13:50,999
There she is.

328
00:13:51,001 --> 00:13:53,301
The old counselor.

329
00:13:53,303 --> 00:13:55,637
Who used to hold
Sherlock's hand.

330
00:13:57,608 --> 00:13:59,741
Everything that you read,

331
00:13:59,743 --> 00:14:02,510
everything that happened to me,
that's all it is.

332
00:14:02,512 --> 00:14:04,646
It's just something
that happened.

333
00:14:04,648 --> 00:14:08,116
And it's all
in the past now.

334
00:14:08,118 --> 00:14:10,685
So let's just
leave it there, shall we?

335
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:24,667
Hello.

336
00:14:24,668 --> 00:14:26,001
You've had sex.

337
00:14:26,003 --> 00:14:27,202
Excuse me?

338
00:14:27,204 --> 00:14:28,503
I can hear it
in your voice.

339
00:14:28,505 --> 00:14:29,771
You've joined paunches.

340
00:14:29,773 --> 00:14:30,972
Good for you, Watson.

341
00:14:30,974 --> 00:14:32,807
As you know, I think
the act of love

342
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:34,676
can be quite conducive to...
What do you want?

343
00:14:34,678 --> 00:14:36,911
Merely to apprise you
of a new development

344
00:14:36,913 --> 00:14:38,280
in the murder of
Ike Walaczek.

345
00:14:38,282 --> 00:14:40,115
As I informed
you yesterday,

346
00:14:40,117 --> 00:14:42,284
Harlan and I were given
a new list of competitors.

347
00:14:42,286 --> 00:14:45,320
One name leapt out:
Byron Lowenthal.

348
00:14:45,322 --> 00:14:48,156
He's a statistician at the
Public Utilities Commission

349
00:14:48,158 --> 00:14:50,425
and a diagnosed
paranoid schizophrenic.

350
00:14:50,427 --> 00:14:52,160
He's been hospitalized
for becoming violent

351
00:14:52,162 --> 00:14:53,728
on no fewer
than three occasions.

352
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,964
Certainly sounds like
it could be our guy.

353
00:14:55,966 --> 00:14:59,367
Unfortunately, Mr. Lowenthal had
another break earlier this year.

354
00:14:59,369 --> 00:15:02,137
He's been staying in
a transient hotel ever since.

355
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:04,239
Detective Bell and I
are going to speak with him.

356
00:15:04,241 --> 00:15:05,307
You want me to meet you?

357
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:06,875
Oh, no, we're already here.

358
00:15:06,877 --> 00:15:08,410
Anyway, now that I know
that you've enjoyed coitus

359
00:15:08,412 --> 00:15:09,778
and could enjoy more
in the near future...

360
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,846
When you're done,
we need to talk.

361
00:15:14,718 --> 00:15:16,818
Byron Lowenthal,
you in there?

362
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,053
Who is it?

363
00:15:18,055 --> 00:15:19,754
It's Detective Bell, NYPD.

364
00:15:19,756 --> 00:15:22,257
My colleague and I would like
to ask you some questions.

365
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:24,592
Let me
get some pants on.

366
00:15:37,341 --> 00:15:40,008
S-Sorry, I just... I, um...

367
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,310
I-I thought I heard
Mr. Lowenthal retr...

368
00:16:19,154 --> 00:16:21,267
You guys got lucky.

369
00:16:21,268 --> 00:16:22,868
Well, luck had little
to do with it, actually.

370
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,536
I... I heard Mr. Lowenthal

371
00:16:24,538 --> 00:16:27,039
pulling a heavy object off
a shelf, placing it on his bed,

372
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,041
and the sound of
the zipper indicated

373
00:16:29,043 --> 00:16:30,976
that it was
a large gun case.

374
00:16:30,978 --> 00:16:33,579
Looks like he was sane enough
to do math, but not much else.

375
00:16:33,581 --> 00:16:34,747
Plus, he was
pretty hopped up.

376
00:16:34,749 --> 00:16:36,448
Caffeine pills,
energy drinks,

377
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,251
pretty much every legal
stimulant you can buy.

378
00:16:39,253 --> 00:16:40,853
Plus a few illegal ones.

379
00:16:40,855 --> 00:16:42,821
Hmm. Obviously, he was
keeping himself awake

380
00:16:42,823 --> 00:16:44,490
so he could work on
Belphegor's.

381
00:16:44,492 --> 00:16:47,392
This... is obvious to you?

382
00:16:47,394 --> 00:16:48,961
I confess the maths
are beyond me,

383
00:16:48,963 --> 00:16:51,130
but I took the liberty of
sending pictures of what

384
00:16:51,132 --> 00:16:52,865
appear to be Mr. Lowenthal's
most recent scribbles

385
00:16:52,867 --> 00:16:54,166
to Harlan Emple,
and he's confirmed

386
00:16:54,168 --> 00:16:55,667
they are part of the contest.

387
00:16:55,669 --> 00:16:56,969
With your permission,
I'd like copies of these

388
00:16:56,971 --> 00:16:58,837
sent to my home
so he can review them.

389
00:16:58,839 --> 00:16:59,972
What for?

390
00:16:59,974 --> 00:17:01,073
If Byron Lowenthal

391
00:17:01,075 --> 00:17:02,441
did kill Ike Walaczek,

392
00:17:02,443 --> 00:17:04,109
then he used
and obscured a phone number,

393
00:17:04,111 --> 00:17:05,878
which would have yielded
the next problem.

394
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,379
That problem's solution

395
00:17:07,381 --> 00:17:08,714
would be GPS coordinates.

396
00:17:08,716 --> 00:17:10,415
If he's recorded them
in his books...

397
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:12,551
Your pal will be able to tell us
where he's headed next.

398
00:17:12,553 --> 00:17:14,853
I'll get our guys to give you

399
00:17:14,855 --> 00:17:16,388
whatever you need.

400
00:17:17,258 --> 00:17:18,991
Scans are still coming through,

401
00:17:18,993 --> 00:17:21,260
but I've put what we've got
so far up on the wall.

402
00:17:21,262 --> 00:17:23,262
Sherlock said that
you prefer it that way.

403
00:17:23,264 --> 00:17:25,030
Picked it up from him,
actually.

404
00:17:25,032 --> 00:17:28,600
Makes me feel like I'm really
inside of the problem.

405
00:17:30,704 --> 00:17:33,372
I'll, uh, let you know
if I need anything.

406
00:17:34,275 --> 00:17:35,974
Oh, I work without a shirt.

407
00:17:35,976 --> 00:17:38,911
Sometimes makes me feel
closer to the numbers.

408
00:17:38,913 --> 00:17:42,147
You'll need to, uh,
check the printer in the study

409
00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:43,615
for more pages.

410
00:17:43,617 --> 00:17:45,417
Uh, this is nice,
you know?

411
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:47,452
Meeting another member
of the team.

412
00:17:47,454 --> 00:17:48,654
You know, Team Sherlock.

413
00:17:48,656 --> 00:17:50,656
You help him, I help him...

414
00:17:51,926 --> 00:17:53,559
Obviously, you haven't
tackled a case

415
00:17:53,561 --> 00:17:55,093
with high-order math since
you started working with him,

416
00:17:55,095 --> 00:17:57,729
or we would've...

417
00:17:57,731 --> 00:17:59,031
What?

418
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:00,232
What?

419
00:18:00,234 --> 00:18:01,834
Wait...

420
00:18:01,836 --> 00:18:04,002
have you worked a case
with high-order math?

421
00:18:04,805 --> 00:18:06,238
You have, haven't you?

422
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,840
Does it matter?

423
00:18:07,842 --> 00:18:09,842
Of course it...

424
00:18:09,844 --> 00:18:11,443
Oh, my God.

425
00:18:11,445 --> 00:18:13,278
Did he fire me?

426
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,980
All I know
is that back in London,

427
00:18:14,982 --> 00:18:16,982
we worked a case that involved
Fibonacci spirals...

428
00:18:16,984 --> 00:18:18,483
He fired me.

429
00:18:18,485 --> 00:18:21,386
...and he called some woman
named Indira Patel.

430
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,856
She's at Berkeley.

431
00:18:23,858 --> 00:18:25,624
I'm three time zones closer!

432
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:27,125
You're here now.

433
00:18:27,127 --> 00:18:29,428
Sure, because I found
a dead body.

434
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,531
I have to go; I have to run
some errands for Sherlock.

435
00:18:35,936 --> 00:18:37,903
I-I don't know
what was in the crate,

436
00:18:37,905 --> 00:18:39,271
but the stenciling on
the side indicates

437
00:18:39,273 --> 00:18:40,772
it came from one of
the SUNY schools.

438
00:18:40,774 --> 00:18:42,908
I put another detective
on Keswick...

439
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:45,177
Don't kill me, I had to
use your razor to shave.

440
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:47,179
I...

441
00:18:47,181 --> 00:18:49,147
You must be Andrew.

442
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:50,515
Sherlock Holmes.

443
00:18:50,517 --> 00:18:52,551
Sorry.

444
00:18:52,553 --> 00:18:55,487
Joan said you were coming;
I... I forgot.

445
00:18:55,489 --> 00:18:57,122
It's not how
I wanted to meet you.

446
00:18:57,124 --> 00:18:58,891
She said you can tell
a lot about people

447
00:18:58,893 --> 00:19:00,192
just by looking at them.

448
00:19:00,194 --> 00:19:02,261
I swear, I...
usually wear pants.

449
00:19:02,263 --> 00:19:03,729
Well, in my experience,
most people

450
00:19:03,731 --> 00:19:05,264
need only be concerned
I won't notice

451
00:19:05,266 --> 00:19:06,498
anything worth remarking upon.

452
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:10,535
Watson seems adequately sexed.

453
00:19:11,939 --> 00:19:13,672
Hey.

454
00:19:13,674 --> 00:19:15,674
I was just introducing myself.

455
00:19:17,945 --> 00:19:20,379
I've got that thing.
I'll see you tonight.

456
00:19:20,381 --> 00:19:21,580
Okay.

457
00:19:27,855 --> 00:19:30,188
Your home, Watson...

458
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,823
it's utterly pleasant.

459
00:19:31,825 --> 00:19:33,692
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

460
00:19:33,694 --> 00:19:35,394
When you told me
you wanted a life of your own,

461
00:19:35,396 --> 00:19:36,595
I didn't realize
that you meant you wanted

462
00:19:36,597 --> 00:19:38,030
the same life everyone else has.

463
00:19:38,032 --> 00:19:39,464
But at any rate,
none of my business, is it?

464
00:19:39,466 --> 00:19:41,233
It's not.
And I didn't ask you here

465
00:19:41,235 --> 00:19:42,634
to talk about my apartment.

466
00:19:42,636 --> 00:19:44,970
No, you asked me here
to discuss Kitty.

467
00:19:44,972 --> 00:19:46,471
If she were not
the topic of conversation,

468
00:19:46,473 --> 00:19:48,941
then you wouldn't have
invited me to your home,

469
00:19:48,943 --> 00:19:50,776
where there's no chance
she'll be present.

470
00:19:52,346 --> 00:19:53,946
She disappointed you
in some way.

471
00:19:53,948 --> 00:19:55,247
Skills not up to snuff?

472
00:19:55,249 --> 00:19:57,316
Please remember
she is a novice.

473
00:19:57,318 --> 00:19:58,850
Actually, she did a great job.

474
00:19:58,852 --> 00:20:00,285
But I have some concerns.

475
00:20:00,287 --> 00:20:01,954
I thought we could
talk about them.

476
00:20:03,757 --> 00:20:04,923
You think that
Kitty needs help

477
00:20:04,925 --> 00:20:06,091
above and beyond
my mentorship.

478
00:20:06,093 --> 00:20:07,392
You read the same
file I did.

479
00:20:07,394 --> 00:20:08,894
She's a rape victim.

480
00:20:08,896 --> 00:20:11,296
She was kept and tortured.

481
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,899
Mm.

482
00:20:16,136 --> 00:20:19,171
You know me, so surely you know

483
00:20:19,173 --> 00:20:22,874
I've broached the subject of
a support group meeting before.

484
00:20:22,876 --> 00:20:25,010
Even offered
to pay for therapy.

485
00:20:25,012 --> 00:20:26,812
She's not interested, I know.

486
00:20:26,814 --> 00:20:28,447
Just as you also know

487
00:20:28,449 --> 00:20:30,749
someone with a problem
can't be forced to get help.

488
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:32,551
They have to want it.

489
00:20:32,553 --> 00:20:34,786
What Kitty wants
is to be a detective.

490
00:20:36,523 --> 00:20:38,490
I am taking pains
to try and channel

491
00:20:38,492 --> 00:20:40,592
her residual feelings
into her work.

492
00:20:42,329 --> 00:20:44,463
Well, that works out
great for you.

493
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:48,400
You told me that
you took on a partner

494
00:20:48,402 --> 00:20:50,635
because you wanted to replicate
what you and I had.

495
00:20:50,637 --> 00:20:52,637
That you thought it helped
with your recovery.

496
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:54,539
You think I would
try and take advantage

497
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,208
of the victim of a trauma?

498
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,910
Of course not, but there is
a conflict of interest here.

499
00:20:58,912 --> 00:21:02,447
She needs what she needs,
but you need what you need, too.

500
00:21:06,053 --> 00:21:10,055
It's-it's good that you're
in her life now, Watson.

501
00:21:10,057 --> 00:21:12,524
I mean,
it's commonly believed that, um,

502
00:21:12,526 --> 00:21:16,228
a child benefits mostly from
the presence of two parents.

503
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,164
He-- or she, in this case--
can absorb certain qualities

504
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,466
from the father--
clear-eyed view of the world,

505
00:21:21,468 --> 00:21:23,168
capacity of
rational thought, etcetera.

506
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,170
They can also absorb certain
qualities from the mother.

507
00:21:25,172 --> 00:21:27,105
Excuse me, but I am not
Kitty's mother,

508
00:21:27,107 --> 00:21:28,807
and she sure as hell
is not our child.

509
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:30,942
You brought her here;
she looks up to you.

510
00:21:30,944 --> 00:21:32,944
She says that she doesn't
need help-- fine--

511
00:21:32,946 --> 00:21:34,579
but you know better.

512
00:21:34,581 --> 00:21:37,082
And you're gonna have to be
the one that tells her.

513
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,620
It's Harlan.

514
00:21:41,622 --> 00:21:44,523
Making progress with the maths.

515
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,660
We thought
that Byron and Ike

516
00:21:48,662 --> 00:21:50,462
arrived at Portal Ten
simultaneously.

517
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,664
That would've meant that they
were doing all the same math

518
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,032
at essentially
the same time.

519
00:21:54,034 --> 00:21:56,001
Only, the math
you found at Byron's place

520
00:21:56,003 --> 00:21:57,003
says that's wrong.

521
00:21:57,004 --> 00:21:58,470
He was one step behind Ike.

522
00:21:58,472 --> 00:22:00,705
Are you proposing he did
not kill Mr. Walaczek?

523
00:22:00,707 --> 00:22:03,175
I don't know, but that's
not the weirdest part.

524
00:22:03,177 --> 00:22:04,810
Byron was obsessive.

525
00:22:04,812 --> 00:22:06,211
He time-stamped
almost everything he did.

526
00:22:06,213 --> 00:22:09,047
He only solved
the Portal Nine problem,

527
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:11,316
the same problem that sent me
to that old factory last night.

528
00:22:11,318 --> 00:22:12,884
But get this--

529
00:22:12,886 --> 00:22:14,686
he wasn't given
the same problem as me.

530
00:22:14,688 --> 00:22:16,655
And so it would've yielded
GPS coordinates

531
00:22:16,657 --> 00:22:18,323
for an entirely
different location.

532
00:22:18,325 --> 00:22:21,760
The person in charge of
the game changed the clue

533
00:22:21,762 --> 00:22:23,328
after the police
found Ike's body.

534
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:25,964
Well, he had to, right?

535
00:22:25,966 --> 00:22:27,899
If he hadn't, he would be
sending other competitors

536
00:22:27,901 --> 00:22:29,101
to an active crime scene.

537
00:22:29,103 --> 00:22:30,402
The important thing is

538
00:22:30,404 --> 00:22:31,536
I figured out the coordinates

539
00:22:31,538 --> 00:22:32,771
to the second location.

540
00:22:32,773 --> 00:22:35,540
I know where Byron went.

541
00:22:35,542 --> 00:22:36,842
What are you doing?

542
00:22:36,844 --> 00:22:38,410
You're saying he
time-stamped everything.

543
00:22:38,412 --> 00:22:40,345
I'm looking at the time
he received his clues.

544
00:22:40,347 --> 00:22:42,647
It's all there, to the second,
but what does that have to do...

545
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:44,149
What if you hadn't
found a body?

546
00:22:44,151 --> 00:22:46,118
If the game had
proceeded as planned,

547
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,486
what were you meant
to do there?

548
00:22:47,488 --> 00:22:49,354
I would have sent a text
to the phone number,

549
00:22:49,356 --> 00:22:51,523
the one that the killer painted
over, and then I would have

550
00:22:51,525 --> 00:22:52,891
gotten a message back
with the next problem.

551
00:22:52,893 --> 00:22:54,559
There's an extra
step in there.

552
00:22:54,561 --> 00:22:56,428
Why all this rigmarole with
phone numbers and texts?

553
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,064
Why not just post the problem
itself at the factory?

554
00:22:59,066 --> 00:23:02,100
I don't know, it's just the way
the game is played.

555
00:23:02,102 --> 00:23:04,102
They're for an old
industrial area in Queens.

556
00:23:04,104 --> 00:23:06,805
You're welcome
for finding your suspect.

557
00:23:06,807 --> 00:23:09,207
If I'm right, Harlan,
what you've found...

558
00:23:09,209 --> 00:23:11,109
is the site of
another murder.

559
00:23:11,111 --> 00:23:13,245
Byron Lowenthal's.

560
00:23:15,983 --> 00:23:18,216
You were right,
Lowenthal's dead.

561
00:23:18,218 --> 00:23:20,952
He was shot in the foot,
then the knee.

562
00:23:20,954 --> 00:23:22,821
Just like
Ike Wallaczek.

563
00:23:22,823 --> 00:23:26,391
I'm, uh, gonna look
over here now.

564
00:23:26,393 --> 00:23:29,427
Well, we think the perp
was pulling the body

565
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:31,429
to a car that was parked
over there.

566
00:23:31,431 --> 00:23:34,065
Then he just
left him here.

567
00:23:34,067 --> 00:23:35,901
Probably afraid
he'd been spotted.

568
00:23:35,903 --> 00:23:38,803
There's a lot
of homeless in the area.

569
00:23:41,441 --> 00:23:43,008
Question is:

570
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:45,010
how'd you know
Lowenthal was the next victim

571
00:23:45,012 --> 00:23:46,511
and not the killer?

572
00:23:49,316 --> 00:23:51,750
Well, that's
quite simple, really.

573
00:23:51,752 --> 00:23:54,352
The game is directing
its players to remote locales,

574
00:23:54,354 --> 00:23:56,788
and then instructing them
to send a text message

575
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,256
indicating their presence.

576
00:23:58,258 --> 00:24:00,125
I suspect the killer wanted
to remove the body

577
00:24:00,127 --> 00:24:02,928
so he could keep this new
location “in play,” so to speak.

578
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:05,130
Still missing the “simple” part.

579
00:24:05,132 --> 00:24:06,698
The late Mr. Lowenthal

580
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,366
received his final clue

581
00:24:08,368 --> 00:24:10,235
after Harlan discovered
Ike Wallaczek's body,

582
00:24:10,237 --> 00:24:12,737
but before news of the killing
had reached the media.

583
00:24:12,739 --> 00:24:14,439
That means the
game's designer

584
00:24:14,441 --> 00:24:16,408
knew the location
had been compromised.

585
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,577
And the only way
that he could have known that,

586
00:24:18,579 --> 00:24:20,111
at the time that he knew it,

587
00:24:20,113 --> 00:24:21,880
was if he, himself,
was the killer.

588
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,917
Belphegor's Prime is not
a treasure hunt.

589
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,619
It's a trap.

590
00:24:40,696 --> 00:24:42,196
Better?

591
00:24:42,198 --> 00:24:44,665
False alarm.

592
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:47,668
But I still feel
a little queasy.

593
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,273
This new dead guy--

594
00:24:52,275 --> 00:24:54,875
your friend said that he was
tortured, too, right?

595
00:24:54,877 --> 00:24:57,244
Right before the killer tried
to abscond with his corpse.

596
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:59,213
I assume
he intended to take

597
00:24:59,215 --> 00:25:02,383
Ike Wallaczek away with him
as well, only Ike was too large.

598
00:25:02,385 --> 00:25:04,685
A speedy mothballing
was the best he could do.

599
00:25:04,687 --> 00:25:07,221
So, just to recap,

600
00:25:07,223 --> 00:25:09,657
I've spent the last
few months of my life

601
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:13,360
playing a game that was
designed to kill me.

602
00:25:13,362 --> 00:25:15,629
Got to be a metaphor
in there somewhere, right?

603
00:25:15,631 --> 00:25:18,966
I think the word you're
looking for is “moral.”

604
00:25:18,968 --> 00:25:21,902
There is a moral in there:
games are for idiots.

605
00:25:24,707 --> 00:25:26,473
Breaking news from Ramapo.

606
00:25:26,475 --> 00:25:29,443
Kitty reports the Center for
Applied Mathematics and Logic

607
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,912
is not the sponsor
of Belphegor's Prime.

608
00:25:31,914 --> 00:25:34,148
Then it's got to be
a serial killer, right?

609
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,716
Someone who's obsessed
with mathematicians?

610
00:25:35,718 --> 00:25:37,284
Mm.

611
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,920
Perhaps he was bullied
by mathematicians as a child.

612
00:25:39,922 --> 00:25:42,056
Or mathematicians
killed his parents.

613
00:25:42,058 --> 00:25:43,657
I'm being serious.

614
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:45,726
Serial killers who devise
elaborate death traps

615
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,461
are the stuff of pulp fiction.

616
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:49,229
And besides, with respect
to these murders,

617
00:25:49,231 --> 00:25:51,165
there are none
of the elaborations

618
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:53,767
which mark that sort of culprit.

619
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:55,970
If anything, I would describe
the work as businesslike.

620
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:58,172
Then it's the government.

621
00:25:58,174 --> 00:26:01,241
I mean, the-the game was some
sort of test to weed out people

622
00:26:01,243 --> 00:26:03,243
who could weaponize math.

623
00:26:03,245 --> 00:26:05,179
The American intelligence
apparatus may be clod-like,

624
00:26:05,181 --> 00:26:07,014
but I think they would
do a better job

625
00:26:07,016 --> 00:26:08,749
of disposing of two bodies,
don't you?

626
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:11,785
Watson?

627
00:26:11,787 --> 00:26:13,621
I just heard
from one of the suspects

628
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:14,922
Marcus and I talked to
yesterday,

629
00:26:14,924 --> 00:26:16,290
another puzzle-hunter.

630
00:26:16,292 --> 00:26:18,525
Tell me he confessed
to the murders.

631
00:26:18,527 --> 00:26:20,427
We ruled him out right away,
but he heard about

632
00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:22,329
Byron Lowenthal's murder on
the news and wanted me to know

633
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:25,165
he's at a friend's place,
some guy named Paul.

634
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,934
That is fascinating.

635
00:26:26,936 --> 00:26:28,369
Actually, it might be.

636
00:26:28,371 --> 00:26:31,038
Paul is positive he knows
who the killer is.

637
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,807
I know the guards
are a bit much,

638
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:35,509
but I wanted everyone
to feel safe.

639
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:38,178
And, besides,
math has been good to me.

640
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,279
Commodities.

641
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:40,848
So, you and your friends,

642
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:43,150
you were competitors
in Belphegor's Prime?

643
00:26:43,152 --> 00:26:45,352
Most of us. Some of the others
are just here for the math.

644
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,121
You said you could
identify the killer.

645
00:26:47,123 --> 00:26:49,323
I can, sort of.

646
00:26:52,061 --> 00:26:54,194
“Mo Shellshocker.”

647
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:56,930
It's a pseudonym,
obviously, but I'm telling you,

648
00:26:56,932 --> 00:26:58,365
this is the guy
you're looking for.

649
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,600
I've heard of him.

650
00:26:59,602 --> 00:27:01,335
He uses his blog
to expose bad math.

651
00:27:01,337 --> 00:27:03,837
Corrupt economists, biased
pollsters, that sort of thing.

652
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:05,572
He's actually
sort of a crusader.

653
00:27:05,574 --> 00:27:06,574
He's a murderer.

654
00:27:06,575 --> 00:27:09,143
How can you be
so sure?

655
00:27:09,145 --> 00:27:10,744
When he isn't crusading,
he's competing in puzzle hunts.

656
00:27:10,746 --> 00:27:11,812
A few months ago,

657
00:27:11,814 --> 00:27:13,080
he claimed to
have solved

658
00:27:13,082 --> 00:27:14,815
Cicada 3301 two
years in a row.

659
00:27:14,817 --> 00:27:17,484
Some people called BS,
including...

660
00:27:17,486 --> 00:27:20,120
Ike Wallaczek
and Byron Lowenthal.

661
00:27:20,122 --> 00:27:21,221
“WallaCheckYourMath,”

662
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:22,489
“ByLow2020.”

663
00:27:22,491 --> 00:27:23,757
Those are their
online handles.

664
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:25,392
Their friends
will confirm it.

665
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,528
A flame war does not
a murderer make.

666
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:30,097
The stuff these guys were
slinging at each other was ugly.

667
00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:32,099
Mo knew they were into hunts,
and so he built one

668
00:27:32,101 --> 00:27:34,034
that would send them to places
where he could kill them.

669
00:27:34,036 --> 00:27:35,469
That's what we're
doing here is

670
00:27:35,471 --> 00:27:36,837
we're just sifting
through all the math

671
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:38,338
he's posted on his blog
over the years,

672
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,840
to see if we could
find his signature

673
00:27:39,842 --> 00:27:41,975
or something that
could identify him.

674
00:27:41,977 --> 00:27:45,279
If two people weren't dead,
we'd probably be having fun.

675
00:27:45,281 --> 00:27:46,747
But still, the
chances that he left

676
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:48,582
something like that
in his math...

677
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,784
If it's there, we'll find it.
In the meantime,

678
00:27:50,786 --> 00:27:52,186
we thought the
police should know

679
00:27:52,188 --> 00:27:53,687
who they're really
dealing with.

680
00:27:53,689 --> 00:27:55,389
<i>I've got to go meet someone</i>

681
00:27:55,391 --> 00:27:56,924
about my other case.

682
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:59,927
You're good to pass all this
along to Marcus? Okay.

683
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:03,030
I must say, I'm surprised you
didn't offer to stay and help.

684
00:28:03,032 --> 00:28:05,265
Mr. Ettinger makes
a compelling case with respect

685
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,067
to Mo Shellshocker's
viability as a suspect.

686
00:28:07,069 --> 00:28:09,002
Mo is a genius.

687
00:28:09,004 --> 00:28:10,637
We're talking off the charts.

688
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:12,139
Leibniz meets Euler meets Gauss.

689
00:28:12,141 --> 00:28:14,108
Huh.
He may have an ego,

690
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,110
but he's not gonna kill
anyone over a few comments.

691
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:18,312
So, while “The League of
Concerned Mathematician”"

692
00:28:18,314 --> 00:28:21,014
chases its tail up there, I
am gonna do the smart thing

693
00:28:21,016 --> 00:28:22,416
and get out of town.

694
00:28:22,418 --> 00:28:24,485
You can let me know
when it all blows over.

695
00:28:24,487 --> 00:28:26,386
You're not going
anywhere, Harlan.

696
00:28:26,388 --> 00:28:29,223
Or should I call you
Mo Shellshocker?

697
00:28:32,728 --> 00:28:34,661
Did you honestly think
I wouldn't recognize

698
00:28:34,663 --> 00:28:36,130
an anagram of my own name?

699
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:40,567
I knew I should've gone
with “Choker Hell Moss”"

700
00:28:40,569 --> 00:28:42,569
But I never thought
that you would see it, okay?

701
00:28:42,571 --> 00:28:44,104
Math is my thing, not yours.

702
00:28:44,106 --> 00:28:46,473
It's my name, Harlan;
that makes it my thing.

703
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,675
It was an homage.

704
00:28:48,677 --> 00:28:50,043
Explain.

705
00:28:50,045 --> 00:28:52,045
Every day, all over the world,

706
00:28:52,047 --> 00:28:54,348
math is used to trick people.

707
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,917
Data dredging to sell
pharmaceuticals.

708
00:28:56,919 --> 00:28:59,720
Publication bias
to justify wars.

709
00:28:59,722 --> 00:29:02,322
In the wrong hands, math can be
manipulated, abused.

710
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:05,425
And I decided to do
something about it.

711
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:09,596
You catch people
who murder other people.

712
00:29:09,598 --> 00:29:11,431
I catch people who murder math.

713
00:29:11,433 --> 00:29:14,568
According to this,
Mo is a wanted man.

714
00:29:17,606 --> 00:29:19,940
Harlan?

715
00:29:19,942 --> 00:29:23,110
The D.O.D. was working
on a new fighter.

716
00:29:23,112 --> 00:29:27,047
Only, I knew that the
performance stats were bogus.

717
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:29,116
A friend of mine found
the internal numbers,

718
00:29:29,118 --> 00:29:31,251
and I sort of published them.

719
00:29:31,253 --> 00:29:33,320
So you put classified
Department of Defense documents

720
00:29:33,322 --> 00:29:34,888
on the Internet.

721
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:36,623
Isn't that what
you would have done?

722
00:29:38,928 --> 00:29:41,562
Fine! I screwed up, okay?

723
00:29:41,564 --> 00:29:43,730
But, hey, that's what I do,
right? I screw up.

724
00:29:43,732 --> 00:29:46,233
If I didn't, then probably you
wouldn't have secretly fired me.

725
00:29:46,235 --> 00:29:47,968
Excuse me?

726
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,403
I know about Indira Patel!

727
00:29:51,006 --> 00:29:53,340
I know you replaced me.

728
00:29:55,144 --> 00:29:58,979
Kitty, I think
we could use some tea.

729
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:04,318
Just tell me.

730
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,253
Tell me what math I got wrong.

731
00:30:06,255 --> 00:30:09,356
Tell me why you didn't let me
make it up to you.

732
00:30:09,358 --> 00:30:12,926
It wasn't the maths, it was you.

733
00:30:14,763 --> 00:30:18,232
Your work was impeccable.

734
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:20,334
And for the most part,
I enjoyed our collaborations.

735
00:30:20,336 --> 00:30:24,838
B-But over time, you just...
you became quite... needy.

736
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,406
What are you talking about?

737
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:29,109
Y-You asked my advice
on-on social matters,

738
00:30:29,111 --> 00:30:32,512
and you even invited me
to a party.

739
00:30:32,514 --> 00:30:34,648
You were my friend.

740
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,416
I was your employer, Harlan.

741
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:37,918
A-And you were my consultant.

742
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,419
One of many.

743
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:43,757
I know that I'm a little
obsessed with what I do.

744
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:46,960
That has always made it hard
to make friends.

745
00:30:46,962 --> 00:30:50,664
And I used to feel pretty bad
about that, and then I met you.

746
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:52,566
And I thought to myself,

747
00:30:52,568 --> 00:30:55,903
hey, if it doesn't bother him,
why should I let it bother me?

748
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:03,810
I got a lot
out of the work that we did.

749
00:31:03,812 --> 00:31:06,146
A lot.

750
00:31:06,148 --> 00:31:11,218
But if someone like you thinks
that I'm a loser, then...

751
00:31:22,564 --> 00:31:24,965
Hey, are we still doing this?

752
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:26,366
Doing what?

753
00:31:26,368 --> 00:31:28,502
Talking about the case.

754
00:31:28,504 --> 00:31:30,070
You're just sitting there.

755
00:31:30,072 --> 00:31:32,105
I'm thinking.

756
00:31:32,107 --> 00:31:34,308
I suspect the silence
is exacerbated

757
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,143
by the nature
of our communication.

758
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:37,811
Yes. Well, I don't
live there anymore.

759
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,713
So, if you want
to talk shop at night,

760
00:31:39,715 --> 00:31:41,515
this is the best I can do.

761
00:31:41,517 --> 00:31:45,252
Keep asking myself:
what did the killer want?

762
00:31:45,254 --> 00:31:48,255
He went to great lengths to lure
brilliant mathematicians

763
00:31:48,257 --> 00:31:49,489
to their deaths.

764
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,525
Winnowed out
the less gifted

765
00:31:51,527 --> 00:31:54,061
by making his problems
more and more complicated.

766
00:31:54,063 --> 00:31:57,597
He had a type, but I still think
he's a serial killer

767
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:59,266
only in the most
technical sense.

768
00:31:59,268 --> 00:32:01,201
He tortured both his victims.

769
00:32:01,203 --> 00:32:02,936
But there's no sign
that he enjoyed it.

770
00:32:02,938 --> 00:32:04,538
The work was
utilitarian,

771
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,740
suggesting it was
less for pleasure

772
00:32:06,742 --> 00:32:10,043
and more for persuasion.

773
00:32:10,045 --> 00:32:11,945
He wanted something.

774
00:32:11,947 --> 00:32:13,714
But what?

775
00:32:13,716 --> 00:32:16,483
Maybe there's a connection
between Wallaczek and Lowenthal

776
00:32:16,485 --> 00:32:18,418
we haven't spotted yet.

777
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,220
Maybe they were working
on a project together,

778
00:32:20,222 --> 00:32:21,822
something that was worth
a lot of money.

779
00:32:21,824 --> 00:32:23,857
There's no way the killer
could have predicted

780
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:26,093
which competitors would make it
to the terminal stage.

781
00:32:26,095 --> 00:32:28,795
That part of the game
was beyond his control.

782
00:32:28,797 --> 00:32:30,664
If it weren't,
he would've been prepared

783
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:33,300
to dispose of a body
the size of Ike Wallaczek's.

784
00:32:33,302 --> 00:32:35,335
So, even if there were a
connection between the victims,

785
00:32:35,337 --> 00:32:37,070
the killer could not
have counted on them

786
00:32:37,072 --> 00:32:38,839
being lured into his trap.

787
00:32:38,841 --> 00:32:41,041
Certainly not
in sequence.

788
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:45,112
His game was, in many respects,
one of chance.

789
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:51,718
Suggesting he knows what
he wants, but not who has it.

790
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,888
Like he was on a puzzle hunt
of his own.

791
00:32:56,825 --> 00:32:58,859
I'm back.

792
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:05,665
I'll set up
downstairs, yeah?

793
00:33:09,138 --> 00:33:11,238
I've been thinking about
what you said earlier.

794
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,740
I've decided to engage her
one more time

795
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:15,609
with regards
to her recuperation.

796
00:33:17,112 --> 00:33:21,815
I doubt she'll listen,
but I'll keep you apprised.

797
00:33:25,954 --> 00:33:27,421
I've been thinking.

798
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:29,623
About?
You. Your history.

799
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:31,825
Your decision
not to seek help.

800
00:33:31,827 --> 00:33:34,594
I think it's
a mistake.

801
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,530
Oh?

802
00:33:36,532 --> 00:33:38,198
I've looked into a number
of support groups.

803
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,633
As you are well aware,

804
00:33:39,635 --> 00:33:41,701
I have benefited greatly
from similar settings.

805
00:33:41,703 --> 00:33:43,270
You have.

806
00:33:43,272 --> 00:33:44,638
The process, I find,

807
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,906
is not unlike
voiding one's bowels...

808
00:33:45,908 --> 00:33:47,808
I'll go.
What?

809
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:49,676
I'll go.
Just get me the details.

810
00:33:52,014 --> 00:33:55,182
I've been thinking, too-- about
your number-cruncher, Harlan.

811
00:33:55,184 --> 00:33:57,017
You think I was
too hard on him.

812
00:33:57,019 --> 00:33:58,685
You will have consultants
of your own one day.

813
00:33:58,687 --> 00:34:01,488
You'll see that they require
management and focus.

814
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:04,124
They are but keys on a keyboard,
and we're the typists.

815
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:06,159
You could've given him
a shoeing for all I care.

816
00:34:06,161 --> 00:34:07,828
No, I'm just saying that

817
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:10,030
some of the stuff he's got
up to, it's quite good.

818
00:34:10,032 --> 00:34:11,698
You should take a look.

819
00:34:13,368 --> 00:34:15,735
You may find a fellow typist.

820
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,076
Hello?

821
00:34:23,078 --> 00:34:25,312
Yeah, I
hear that you and some friends

822
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:27,848
are trying to identify
Mo Shellshocker.

823
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,649
That's right. Who is this?

824
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:32,719
His name is Harlan Emple.

825
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:34,020
You got a pen?

826
00:34:34,022 --> 00:34:36,456
I'll-I'll give you his address.

827
00:34:52,454 --> 00:34:54,020
Harlan.

828
00:34:54,022 --> 00:34:56,356
You can't take a hint, can you?

829
00:34:56,358 --> 00:34:57,657
I got your text messages.

830
00:34:57,659 --> 00:34:58,958
I don't want to see you
right now.

831
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,827
So if you came here
to apologize...

832
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:03,363
Actually, I came here
to spare you an agonizing death.

833
00:35:04,299 --> 00:35:05,832
Can I come in?

834
00:35:05,834 --> 00:35:08,301
I was puzzling earlier

835
00:35:08,303 --> 00:35:12,038
as to why the killer went
to such specific lengths.

836
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,606
What did he want?

837
00:35:13,608 --> 00:35:15,809
And then Watson,
quite by accident,

838
00:35:15,811 --> 00:35:17,410
she made a most
compelling analogy.

839
00:35:17,412 --> 00:35:20,080
She said it was as if he
was on a hunt of his own.

840
00:35:20,082 --> 00:35:22,615
Duh. He was hunting
mathematicians.

841
00:35:22,617 --> 00:35:23,783
No, he wasn't.

842
00:35:23,785 --> 00:35:25,151
He was hunting<i> a</i> mathematician.

843
00:35:25,153 --> 00:35:26,619
One.

844
00:35:26,621 --> 00:35:29,389
A man who had concealed
his identity not only

845
00:35:29,391 --> 00:35:31,191
from the mathematics
community at large,

846
00:35:31,193 --> 00:35:32,859
but also from the FBI.

847
00:35:32,861 --> 00:35:35,395
A “crusader,”
you might call him.

848
00:35:35,397 --> 00:35:36,763
Wait a minute.

849
00:35:36,765 --> 00:35:38,731
Are you saying that
this was all about me?

850
00:35:53,448 --> 00:35:56,449
<i> Unfortunately, emulating</i>
<i>the work of people like me</i>

851
00:35:56,451 --> 00:35:59,018
<i>is not without risks.</i>

852
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,320
Creates enemies.

853
00:36:00,322 --> 00:36:02,889
I knew it was the government.

854
00:36:02,891 --> 00:36:04,424
It was a lottery winner.

855
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,260
Little over a year ago,

856
00:36:07,262 --> 00:36:09,529
you started a series of blogs
where you exposed the flaws

857
00:36:09,531 --> 00:36:11,664
in certain scratch card
lottery games.

858
00:36:11,666 --> 00:36:13,766
Tickets like this one.

859
00:36:13,768 --> 00:36:15,802
I wrote about
baited hook games.

860
00:36:15,804 --> 00:36:17,971
Games where the numbers
are printed on the front.

861
00:36:17,973 --> 00:36:20,707
Scratch off the hidden numbers,
hope for a match.

862
00:36:20,709 --> 00:36:23,309
Only, you proved that with
careful mathematical analysis

863
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:25,512
of the visible numbers,
you could predict

864
00:36:25,514 --> 00:36:28,381
which tickets were winners
80% of the time.

865
00:36:28,383 --> 00:36:29,682
If you had exploited

866
00:36:29,684 --> 00:36:32,085
this flaw,
rather than exposing it,

867
00:36:32,087 --> 00:36:33,520
you could have made millions.

868
00:36:33,522 --> 00:36:36,022
Well... sure.
But that would been cheating.

869
00:36:36,024 --> 00:36:37,157
Right.

870
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:38,825
So imagine
for a moment

871
00:36:38,827 --> 00:36:41,060
that you are a less
honest mathematician.

872
00:36:41,062 --> 00:36:42,495
Right?

873
00:36:42,497 --> 00:36:44,063
You've been taking
advantage of these games

874
00:36:44,065 --> 00:36:47,967
for a couple of years to
amass a small fortune.

875
00:36:47,969 --> 00:36:49,502
And then “Mo"
comes along.

876
00:36:49,504 --> 00:36:51,971
He starts exposing
the broken games.

877
00:36:51,973 --> 00:36:54,340
State lottery commissions
shut them down.

878
00:36:54,342 --> 00:36:56,976
The exploitable
games dry up.

879
00:36:56,978 --> 00:37:00,613
Now, if you were a
psychopathic lottery cheat,

880
00:37:00,615 --> 00:37:02,582
how do you fix that?

881
00:37:02,584 --> 00:37:04,484
You kill Mo.

882
00:37:04,486 --> 00:37:07,253
<i>Unfortunately, Mo is elusive.</i>

883
00:37:07,255 --> 00:37:08,821
<i>Anonymous.</i>

884
00:37:08,823 --> 00:37:11,224
The only thing
he knew about him for sure

885
00:37:11,226 --> 00:37:14,394
was that he could not resist
a puzzle hunt.

886
00:37:14,396 --> 00:37:17,130
Now, if you were smart enough
to identify

887
00:37:17,132 --> 00:37:19,399
and take advantage of
broken lottery games...

888
00:37:19,401 --> 00:37:21,868
Then I'm smart enough
to design a puzzle hunt.

889
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:25,338
This plan was not
without its flaws.

890
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:28,775
Once a competitor
reached the terminal stage,

891
00:37:28,777 --> 00:37:32,745
the killer could not be certain
that he'd trapped Mo, could he?

892
00:37:32,747 --> 00:37:34,480
So he tortured them.

893
00:37:34,482 --> 00:37:37,083
I submit he forced them to
log on to Mo's Web site,

894
00:37:37,085 --> 00:37:39,686
and when they failed...

895
00:37:41,323 --> 00:37:42,755
After two murders,

896
00:37:42,757 --> 00:37:44,290
the game was compromised.

897
00:37:44,292 --> 00:37:46,192
So the killer devises
a Plan “B.”

898
00:37:46,194 --> 00:37:47,460
He tricks

899
00:37:47,462 --> 00:37:49,229
a group of his peers

900
00:37:49,231 --> 00:37:51,097
into helping search
for an alternative means

901
00:37:51,099 --> 00:37:53,032
of identifying Mo.

902
00:37:56,504 --> 00:37:58,438
You're talking about that guy.

903
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,906
The one with the penthouse.

904
00:37:59,908 --> 00:38:02,742
<i>Paul?</i>

905
00:38:02,744 --> 00:38:05,044
Lottery winners
are public record.

906
00:38:05,046 --> 00:38:07,814
So when I searched for
the names of repeat winners

907
00:38:07,816 --> 00:38:09,482
in the dates prior
to your posts...

908
00:38:09,484 --> 00:38:11,317
I can't believe
I drank his water.

909
00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:12,685
I called him.

910
00:38:12,687 --> 00:38:14,654
I identified you as Mo.

911
00:38:14,656 --> 00:38:16,122
And I gave him your address.

912
00:38:16,124 --> 00:38:17,590
You what?!

913
00:38:21,129 --> 00:38:23,062
Drop your weapon!

914
00:38:23,064 --> 00:38:24,597
<i>I did not, however, give him</i>

915
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:25,965
<i>the correct apartment number.</i>

916
00:38:25,967 --> 00:38:28,334
He was arrested
a little over an hour ago.

917
00:38:30,739 --> 00:38:31,871
Tried to call you to
tell you, but, um...

918
00:38:31,873 --> 00:38:33,539
But I was ignoring you.

919
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:35,008
Yes, you were ignoring me.

920
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,209
Look, you know

921
00:38:36,211 --> 00:38:37,377
that I'm still screwed, right?

922
00:38:37,379 --> 00:38:39,279
You told him that I'm Mo.

923
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:42,115
He's gonna tell the police,
they're gonna tell the FBI...

924
00:38:42,117 --> 00:38:43,516
The NYPD is under
the impression

925
00:38:43,518 --> 00:38:45,385
that I lied about
your connection to Mo

926
00:38:45,387 --> 00:38:47,920
in order to draw
Mr. Ettinger out.

927
00:38:47,922 --> 00:38:49,555
As far as the
FBI goes, well,

928
00:38:49,557 --> 00:38:51,958
I've got some associates
who have created a trail

929
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,860
which will
strongly suggest that Mo

930
00:38:53,862 --> 00:38:55,728
is a cyber-terrorist
I became aware of

931
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:58,197
whilst working for, um...

932
00:38:58,199 --> 00:38:59,766
queen and country.

933
00:38:59,768 --> 00:39:02,135
Your secret's
quite safe.

934
00:39:02,137 --> 00:39:03,903
Thanks.

935
00:39:06,508 --> 00:39:09,776
My reasons for preserving you
are entirely selfish, Harlan.

936
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:13,279
You are a tremendous asset.

937
00:39:13,281 --> 00:39:15,815
I have little doubt

938
00:39:15,817 --> 00:39:19,118
I will need your help again
in the future.

939
00:39:26,461 --> 00:39:28,528
Me or him?

940
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:29,996
You.

941
00:39:29,998 --> 00:39:31,798
I have an update on
that real estate flipper.

942
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,433
I thought you might
want to know.

943
00:39:39,274 --> 00:39:41,908
I tracked down the truck rental
receipts to get her name.

944
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,142
Valerie Cork.

945
00:39:43,144 --> 00:39:44,911
She's an art authenticator.

946
00:39:44,913 --> 00:39:46,779
And that crate you saw?

947
00:39:46,781 --> 00:39:48,414
There was
something called

948
00:39:48,416 --> 00:39:50,683
a scanning fluorescence
spectrometry machine inside.

949
00:39:50,685 --> 00:39:52,251
They're used...
To find paintings

950
00:39:52,253 --> 00:39:53,553
underneath other paintings.

951
00:39:53,555 --> 00:39:55,288
So it turns out
that the building

952
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:56,689
Chad Keswick was looking to buy

953
00:39:56,691 --> 00:39:59,025
was leased by the WPA
during the Depression.

954
00:39:59,027 --> 00:40:00,927
They commissioned a
mural for the lobby.

955
00:40:00,929 --> 00:40:03,329
The artist was a
notorious communist,

956
00:40:03,331 --> 00:40:05,365
so when the property passed
into private hands in the '50s,

957
00:40:05,367 --> 00:40:06,999
the new owners
had it painted over.

958
00:40:07,001 --> 00:40:08,735
But it was still there,
under the paint.

959
00:40:08,737 --> 00:40:11,037
A lost work by Diego Rivera.

960
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:13,473
It's worth ten times
the price of the building.

961
00:40:14,676 --> 00:40:17,043
I was hoping to leak
the truth to the<i> Times.</i>

962
00:40:18,113 --> 00:40:20,046
I promised you a cut of my fee.

963
00:40:20,048 --> 00:40:22,148
But I'm pretty sure
the mural's gonna end up

964
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:24,384
in the hands of
a historical trust.

965
00:40:24,386 --> 00:40:26,352
I'd feel obligated
to refund my client,

966
00:40:26,354 --> 00:40:28,388
which means you'd get
a cut of nothing.

967
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:31,457
That works for me.

968
00:40:31,459 --> 00:40:33,493
Okay.

969
00:40:35,463 --> 00:40:37,397
I think you should know

970
00:40:37,399 --> 00:40:39,732
that I am going
to a meeting tonight.

971
00:40:41,803 --> 00:40:45,505
One of those
support groups for...

972
00:40:45,507 --> 00:40:47,340
people like me.

973
00:40:47,342 --> 00:40:49,876
It was, uh, Sherlock's idea.

974
00:40:49,878 --> 00:40:51,644
That's great.

975
00:40:51,646 --> 00:40:53,446
I know you put him up to it.

976
00:40:53,448 --> 00:40:55,381
We talked.

977
00:40:57,552 --> 00:41:00,219
When he first approached me
in London,

978
00:41:00,221 --> 00:41:03,556
I was...

979
00:41:03,558 --> 00:41:05,558
in a bad way.

980
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,227
And I had been for a while.

981
00:41:08,229 --> 00:41:11,130
But then,
when he talked about

982
00:41:11,132 --> 00:41:12,365
the work that he did,

983
00:41:12,367 --> 00:41:16,035
about the things
that he saw in me...

984
00:41:18,406 --> 00:41:19,739
I want it.

985
00:41:19,741 --> 00:41:21,874
I want every bit
of what's he offered me,

986
00:41:21,876 --> 00:41:23,843
of what he offered you, but...

987
00:41:23,845 --> 00:41:26,212
if I've learned one thing
over the last few weeks,

988
00:41:26,214 --> 00:41:28,047
it's that he can't pull it off.

989
00:41:28,049 --> 00:41:29,682
Not by himself, anyway.

990
00:41:31,586 --> 00:41:34,153
And if I'm gonna get
what I want,

991
00:41:34,155 --> 00:41:37,690
then I'm going to need
your help, too.

992
00:41:40,361 --> 00:41:42,829
I still think
the meetings are bollocks,

993
00:41:42,831 --> 00:41:44,931
but you say they're important.

994
00:41:44,933 --> 00:41:47,967
They matter to you, so...

995
00:41:47,969 --> 00:41:49,735
What do you say, Watson?

996
00:41:49,737 --> 00:41:52,071
Will you help me?

997
00:41:56,277 --> 00:41:58,244
I don't know how it happened.

998
00:41:58,246 --> 00:42:01,547
It just... hit me.

999
00:42:01,549 --> 00:42:03,983
Like a truck, out of nowhere.

1000
00:42:04,853 --> 00:42:07,753
Work is good.

1001
00:42:07,755 --> 00:42:09,755
I have friends.

1002
00:42:09,757 --> 00:42:13,092
I'm in a
relationship.

1003
00:42:13,094 --> 00:42:16,896
Somewhere along
the way, somehow,

1004
00:42:16,898 --> 00:42:19,732
I stopped being a victim

1005
00:42:19,734 --> 00:42:22,602
and became a survivor.

1006
00:42:22,604 --> 00:42:25,705
So, I guess all I'm saying is,
there's hope.

1007
00:42:26,357 --> 00:42:31,686
Do the work. Love yourself.
There's hope.

00:00:03,422 --> 00:00:04,761
If you're looking for Sherlock,
he's downstairs.

3
00:00:04,785 --> 00:00:05,841
Okay.

4
00:00:05,842 --> 00:00:07,541
<i>His name is Harlan Emple.</i>

5
00:00:07,543 --> 00:00:09,176
<i>He is the Rachel P. Hanson</i>
<i>Professor</i>

6
00:00:09,178 --> 00:00:11,301
for Applied Mathematics
at Columbia University.

7
00:00:11,301 --> 00:00:14,502
What I don't get is
why he isn't wearing a shirt.

8
00:00:14,504 --> 00:00:17,372
He doesn't like anything to come
between him and the numbers.

9
00:00:17,374 --> 00:00:18,415
What is it?

10
00:00:18,438 --> 00:00:20,274
The answers to your questions
about Kitty.

11
00:00:20,276 --> 00:00:22,710
The truth is she was a
victim of a horrific crime.

12
00:00:22,712 --> 00:00:24,646
<i>After you left last night,</i>

13
00:00:24,648 --> 00:00:26,848
Sherlock gave me an envelope.

14
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,249
Sherlock keeps saying

15
00:00:28,251 --> 00:00:30,385
that I need to get
a better sense of you,

16
00:00:30,387 --> 00:00:33,021
and maybe that will give you
a better sense of me.

17
00:00:42,065 --> 00:00:43,065
It's open.

18
00:00:47,637 --> 00:00:49,003
It's nothing.

19
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:50,872
It's Sherlock and
one of his experts.

20
00:00:50,874 --> 00:00:52,006
Which one?

21
00:00:52,008 --> 00:00:53,241
Phillip something.

22
00:00:53,243 --> 00:00:54,575
Must be new.

23
00:00:54,577 --> 00:00:57,445
He's a knife-thrower.

24
00:00:57,447 --> 00:00:58,913
Why does Sherlock have
a knife-thrower?

25
00:00:58,915 --> 00:01:00,748
He got bored the other day,

26
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,185
started looking into this, uh,
circus accident from the '30s.

27
00:01:04,187 --> 00:01:07,922
The Great Galardo perforated one
of his assistants during an act,

28
00:01:07,924 --> 00:01:09,924
except Sherlock thinks
the blade was thrown

29
00:01:09,926 --> 00:01:11,492
by somebody in the stands,
not Galardo.

30
00:01:11,494 --> 00:01:15,096
Phillip, as far as I
can tell, disagrees.

31
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:18,900
It can't be done, okay?

32
00:01:18,902 --> 00:01:19,934
It was done.

33
00:01:19,936 --> 00:01:21,335
You're wrong.

34
00:01:21,337 --> 00:01:23,538
Nobody can chuck
a knife that far.

35
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,239
What's this?

36
00:01:25,241 --> 00:01:26,207
You're...

37
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:27,209
Not here.

38
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,509
I'm not here.

39
00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:29,711
Remember that, okay?

40
00:01:29,713 --> 00:01:31,279
Oh, yes. Heaven
forfend your work

41
00:01:31,281 --> 00:01:33,247
with me should endanger
your precious day job.

42
00:01:33,249 --> 00:01:35,116
You throw knives?

43
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,252
You know, it was supposed
to be just you here.

44
00:01:38,254 --> 00:01:41,355
Phillip is arguably the greatest
knife-thrower in the world.

45
00:01:41,357 --> 00:01:42,790
Has been for decades.

46
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:43,925
Only, there's little money

47
00:01:43,927 --> 00:01:45,193
to be made
in the impalement arts.

48
00:01:45,195 --> 00:01:46,494
So, as a youth, he turned

49
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,563
to what you Americans
term “football”"

50
00:01:48,565 --> 00:01:50,131
Is this a joke?

51
00:01:53,837 --> 00:01:55,002
Phillip, head
and heart.

52
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:56,904
Come on.
Head and heart.

53
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:06,814
Can I go?

54
00:02:06,816 --> 00:02:09,484
Yeah.

55
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,489
15 years he spent throwing
that misshapen ball around.

56
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:16,057
15 years.

57
00:02:16,059 --> 00:02:18,259
When I think of the acclaim
he could have brought

58
00:02:18,261 --> 00:02:20,828
to competitive blade slinging.

59
00:02:27,237 --> 00:02:29,036
You're following me,
Watson.

60
00:02:29,038 --> 00:02:30,338
I don't like it.

61
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,740
I want you to help
me with something.

62
00:02:32,742 --> 00:02:33,908
This is Chad Keswick.

63
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,976
He buys distressed
buildings,

64
00:02:34,978 --> 00:02:36,210
paints, spackles,

65
00:02:36,212 --> 00:02:37,645
and then flips them
for quick money.

66
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:39,180
Who'd he kill?
No one.

67
00:02:39,182 --> 00:02:41,315
I was hired by one of
his rivals to find out

68
00:02:41,317 --> 00:02:43,017
why he's been circling
this old office building

69
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:44,218
in Jamaica, Queens.

70
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,586
She wants to know
why he thinks

71
00:02:45,588 --> 00:02:47,355
the building is
a good investment.

72
00:02:47,357 --> 00:02:49,590
Is there a crime in there,
something worth investigating?

73
00:02:49,592 --> 00:02:50,925
Well, I've been
shadowing Keswick,

74
00:02:50,927 --> 00:02:52,593
but yesterday I think
he noticed me.

75
00:02:52,595 --> 00:02:54,595
I want to switch
up the tail.

76
00:02:54,597 --> 00:02:57,231
You followed me for over
a week before I noticed you.

77
00:02:57,233 --> 00:02:59,033
Help me out, and I'll
cut you in on my fee.

78
00:02:59,035 --> 00:03:02,003
I don't work for you,
I work for Sherlock.

79
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:03,437
I worked for him, too.

80
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,773
And, in my experience,
he was always supportive

81
00:03:05,775 --> 00:03:07,942
of taking on work
outside the partnership.

82
00:03:07,944 --> 00:03:10,912
Sorry, it's not my cup of tea.

00:05:14,518 --> 00:05:15,984
Well, of course
I was agitated.

105
00:05:15,986 --> 00:05:18,754
I had just found
a dead guy in mothballs!

106
00:05:18,756 --> 00:05:21,790
And did I mention that I have
not slept in almost two days?

107
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:23,358
Because of the math game.

108
00:05:24,762 --> 00:05:26,195
Can I borrow those?

109
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:31,100
This...

110
00:05:31,102 --> 00:05:33,302
is Belphegor's Prime, okay?

111
00:05:33,304 --> 00:05:35,304
It's a numeric palindrome.

112
00:05:35,306 --> 00:05:40,776
It's 666 bookended by 13 zeroes
and then bracketed with ones.

113
00:05:40,778 --> 00:05:43,846
Named for the demon Belphegor
who was a prince of hell.

114
00:05:43,848 --> 00:05:46,448
The first clue for the hunt
started making the rounds

115
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,883
a few months ago.

116
00:05:47,885 --> 00:05:49,651
It was a JPEG with two numbers
hidden in it.

117
00:05:49,653 --> 00:05:51,453
You divide those numbers
by Belphegor's Prime,

118
00:05:51,455 --> 00:05:54,890
and you get the GPS coordinates
for a restroom at the Bronx Zoo.

119
00:05:54,892 --> 00:05:56,959
You go to the restroom,
you find a phone number.

120
00:05:56,961 --> 00:05:58,927
You send a text to the number,
you get the next clue.

121
00:05:58,929 --> 00:05:59,962
Which is another math problem.

122
00:05:59,964 --> 00:06:00,929
Exactly.

123
00:06:00,931 --> 00:06:02,397
Only, this one is harder.

124
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,099
And that's how it works.

125
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:05,934
You know, but for
each one that you solve,

126
00:06:05,936 --> 00:06:08,103
you get a new set
of GPS coordinates.

127
00:06:08,105 --> 00:06:11,473
And that means that you've
completed a stage, or a portal.

128
00:06:11,475 --> 00:06:13,509
And last night,
I was on Portal Ten.

129
00:06:13,511 --> 00:06:15,711
And...

130
00:06:17,014 --> 00:06:18,313
You know what?

131
00:06:18,315 --> 00:06:20,015
I want to talk
to Sherlock and Joan.

132
00:06:20,017 --> 00:06:21,917
Look, Mr. Emple...
No, I'm sorry.

133
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,019
I told the police down
at the factory that I know them.

134
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:25,287
Isn't that the whole reason

135
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:26,922
that I was brought here
to this squad?

136
00:06:26,924 --> 00:06:30,392
I-I am not saying another word
until they are here.

137
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:35,264
Harlan Emple is
indeed an acquaintance.

138
00:06:35,266 --> 00:06:37,733
He is, in point of fact,
one of my “irregulars.”

139
00:06:37,735 --> 00:06:38,801
One of your what?

140
00:06:38,803 --> 00:06:40,302
Irregulars.

141
00:06:40,304 --> 00:06:41,770
I'm your consultant, Captain;
they are mine.

142
00:06:41,772 --> 00:06:43,572
They're a handful
of experts I turn to

143
00:06:43,574 --> 00:06:46,108
when I encounter problems which
are beyond my pool of knowledge.

144
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,810
Harlan is
a brilliant mathematician.

145
00:06:47,812 --> 00:06:49,778
And on the handful of occasions
I have tackled a case

146
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,046
which pertained
to mathematics...

147
00:06:51,048 --> 00:06:53,182
He helped you out.
Well, the good news

148
00:06:53,184 --> 00:06:56,018
for him is the preliminary
autopsy report just came in

149
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,252
before you got here.

150
00:06:57,254 --> 00:06:59,021
And the M.E. puts
the time of death

151
00:06:59,023 --> 00:07:00,989
between 4:00 and
6:00 p.m. last night.

152
00:07:00,991 --> 00:07:02,124
Mr. Emple was teaching

153
00:07:02,126 --> 00:07:03,358
a class at Columbia.

154
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,394
So the victim is
yet to be identified?

155
00:07:05,396 --> 00:07:07,663
No I.D., no phone.

156
00:07:07,665 --> 00:07:09,865
First detective on the scene
liked it for a mob hit,

157
00:07:09,867 --> 00:07:11,500
so while we're
running the prints,

158
00:07:11,502 --> 00:07:13,602
he's showing the vic's
face around OCID.

159
00:07:13,604 --> 00:07:16,839
Marcus here was about to walk
the scene with Mr. Emple.

160
00:07:16,841 --> 00:07:18,774
You're here now;
you might as well tag along.

161
00:07:18,776 --> 00:07:21,009
Actually, Captain,
I'm quite busy today.

162
00:07:21,011 --> 00:07:22,978
This is a John Doe,
and we got nothing.

163
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,247
And, like you just said,
you're my consultant.

164
00:07:25,249 --> 00:07:26,748
So, go consult.

165
00:07:29,787 --> 00:07:30,986
Watson.

166
00:07:30,988 --> 00:07:32,588
Um, he's your friend.

167
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,523
Actually, Kitty is
otherwise engaged,

168
00:07:34,525 --> 00:07:37,426
and he did actually help both
of us with a case last year.

169
00:07:37,428 --> 00:07:38,493
Did he not?

170
00:07:40,865 --> 00:07:44,099
Have I told you
how good it is to see you?

171
00:07:44,101 --> 00:07:45,367
Yes, you have.
Three times.

172
00:07:45,369 --> 00:07:46,468
Well, it is.

173
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,636
Hey, lousy circumstances.

174
00:07:47,638 --> 00:07:49,371
But, uh, hey...

175
00:07:49,373 --> 00:07:51,740
I heard from your boss that you
just, uh, got back from London.

176
00:07:51,742 --> 00:07:53,308
Were you working
a case or...?

177
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,576
No, I moved back there.

178
00:07:54,578 --> 00:07:55,677
You mean<i> moved,</i> moved?

179
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:56,845
Is there another
definition?

180
00:07:56,847 --> 00:07:58,513
I was there for
eight months,

181
00:07:58,515 --> 00:08:00,883
and had a change of heart
and returned to New York.

182
00:08:00,885 --> 00:08:02,517
So, you moved to London,
and you didn't, uh...

183
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,086
You know what?
Doesn't even matter.

184
00:08:04,088 --> 00:08:05,387
The point is you're back!

185
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:07,389
Mr. Emple.
Uh, duty calls.

186
00:08:07,391 --> 00:08:09,024
Yeah.

187
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:18,634
It's interesting.

188
00:08:18,636 --> 00:08:20,068
Mothballs are interesting?

189
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,070
They were taken from
that cabinet over there.

190
00:08:22,072 --> 00:08:25,941
Obviously, to cover the smell
of John Doe's decay.

191
00:08:25,943 --> 00:08:28,043
The killer didn't
bring them with him.

192
00:08:28,045 --> 00:08:31,179
Perhaps leaving the body here
was not part of his plan, hmm?

193
00:08:32,983 --> 00:08:36,018
Doe was shot in the foot
first and then the knee.

194
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,453
Either those were
two really bad misses or...

195
00:08:38,455 --> 00:08:41,256
Or the killer was torturing him.

196
00:08:41,258 --> 00:08:43,892
This doesn't seem like anything
you can't handle on your own.

197
00:08:43,894 --> 00:08:45,994
So you want to tell me why you
really asked me to come here?

198
00:08:45,996 --> 00:08:48,363
“This doesn't seem like anything
you can't handle on your own.”

199
00:08:48,365 --> 00:08:49,765
That's funny.

200
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:51,566
That's exactly what
I would have said

201
00:08:51,568 --> 00:08:53,602
had I been present when you
asked Kitty for her assistance

202
00:08:53,604 --> 00:08:54,937
with your tawdry side job.

203
00:08:54,939 --> 00:08:57,372
“Tawdry”?
I wanted you to know I approve.

204
00:08:57,374 --> 00:08:59,007
Of what?

205
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:01,376
Your agenda
with regards to Kitty.

206
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:03,078
Several days ago,
I gave you her file.

207
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,913
And then you show up at
the brownstone yesterday,

208
00:09:04,915 --> 00:09:06,515
and you invite her
into an investigation.

209
00:09:06,517 --> 00:09:08,183
Coincidence? No, I think not.

210
00:09:08,185 --> 00:09:11,320
You feel for her.
And now you wish to engage.

211
00:09:11,322 --> 00:09:13,956
It's not an outcome
I would have predicted, no.

212
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,458
But it is one
I approve of, yeah.

213
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,193
She could learn
a great deal from you,

214
00:09:18,195 --> 00:09:20,228
especially with regards
to how to get the most

215
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,864
from my tutelage.

216
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:25,734
So, I've already dispatched her
to, uh, follow your Mr. Keswick.

217
00:09:25,736 --> 00:09:27,836
But that's not
what I actually...

218
00:09:27,838 --> 00:09:29,404
Harlan!

219
00:09:30,741 --> 00:09:33,075
You came here to retrieve
a phone number, did you not?

220
00:09:33,077 --> 00:09:34,609
You would send a text,
and then receive

221
00:09:34,611 --> 00:09:36,845
the next clue in the game
that you were playing.

222
00:09:36,847 --> 00:09:38,747
Yeah, but I didn't find it.

223
00:09:38,749 --> 00:09:40,048
Not that I kept looking

224
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,250
after the dead guy
fell out of the locker.

225
00:09:42,252 --> 00:09:44,052
Yeah, CSU didn't find
any number either.

226
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:46,154
Probably because
it's under that paint.

227
00:09:46,156 --> 00:09:48,190
It's fresh.

228
00:09:48,192 --> 00:09:49,891
Applied in the last

229
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:52,694
24 hours.

230
00:09:52,696 --> 00:09:54,696
Right after John Doe's murder,
I'd wager.

231
00:09:54,698 --> 00:09:57,099
You don't think
this was a mob hit?

232
00:09:57,101 --> 00:09:59,101
Doe and the killer were
playing the game, too.

233
00:09:59,103 --> 00:10:01,203
The killer shot Doe and
then covered up the number

234
00:10:01,205 --> 00:10:02,704
so no one else could use it.

235
00:10:02,706 --> 00:10:04,806
What's the prize
in your little contest?

236
00:10:04,808 --> 00:10:07,576
Well, I'm doing it
mostly for the math.

237
00:10:07,578 --> 00:10:11,480
But, uh, $1,707,071.

238
00:10:11,482 --> 00:10:13,882
It's another
palindromic prime.

239
00:10:13,884 --> 00:10:17,152
Did I not mention the
money at the station?

240
00:10:17,154 --> 00:10:18,587
Who the hell can afford

241
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:20,655
that kind of payout
for a puzzle hunt?

242
00:10:20,657 --> 00:10:22,124
Well, most people
think it's CAML.

243
00:10:22,126 --> 00:10:24,593
The Center for Applied
Mathematics and Logic.

244
00:10:24,595 --> 00:10:26,094
It's located
in Ramapo...

245
00:10:26,096 --> 00:10:27,729
Wait, most people
“think” it's them?

246
00:10:27,731 --> 00:10:29,331
Well, hunts like these,

247
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,266
the organizers are
almost always anonymous.

248
00:10:31,268 --> 00:10:32,401
It's S.O.P.

249
00:10:32,403 --> 00:10:34,302
What about the
contestants?

250
00:10:34,304 --> 00:10:37,005
Is anonymity
also S.O.P.?

251
00:10:37,007 --> 00:10:39,207
For the most part, yeah.

252
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:43,078
But, guys, math peeps
are my peeps, okay?

253
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,314
It's, uh, like
a community, sort of.

254
00:10:46,316 --> 00:10:48,984
I can think of ten
or 12 other people

255
00:10:48,986 --> 00:10:50,018
who were probably competing.

256
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,186
Would that help?

257
00:10:53,157 --> 00:10:55,223
No.

258
00:10:55,225 --> 00:10:58,026
I'm sorry, I don't know him.

259
00:10:58,028 --> 00:11:00,862
But you admit you were
competing in Belphegor's Prime.

260
00:11:00,864 --> 00:11:02,197
I do.

261
00:11:04,835 --> 00:11:05,934
Pepe!

262
00:11:08,172 --> 00:11:10,439
Sorry. He doesn't
like strangers.

263
00:11:12,109 --> 00:11:14,443
Give him one of these.

264
00:11:14,445 --> 00:11:16,111
Get on his good side.

265
00:11:24,288 --> 00:11:26,354
What are you doing?

266
00:11:28,225 --> 00:11:30,725
I'm just verifying that
you've been lying to us.

267
00:11:30,727 --> 00:11:33,895
You did know the
dead man, did you not?

268
00:11:33,897 --> 00:11:36,998
I reviewed his personal
effects at the morgue earlier.

269
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,034
The coroner reported finding
crumbs in one of his pockets.

270
00:11:39,036 --> 00:11:40,036
I tasted one.

271
00:11:40,037 --> 00:11:41,269
Why would you...?

272
00:11:41,271 --> 00:11:42,771
At first, I thought
they were from

273
00:11:42,773 --> 00:11:44,439
a particularly rancid
brand of cheese,

274
00:11:44,441 --> 00:11:47,609
but, no... they're from
one of Pepe's treats.

275
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:49,277
Homemade?

276
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,481
Harlan was able to give us
the names of nine other people

277
00:11:52,483 --> 00:11:54,149
he believed to be
other competitors.

278
00:11:54,151 --> 00:11:55,984
Our colleagues are
investigating them as we speak,

279
00:11:55,986 --> 00:11:57,919
but I'll quite happily
recommend that the NYPD

280
00:11:57,921 --> 00:12:00,222
focus its attention
entirely on you.

281
00:12:04,128 --> 00:12:06,428
His name was Ike Walaczek.

282
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,231
In another lifetime,
he was my boyfriend.

283
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:10,866
And what of
this lifetime?

284
00:12:10,868 --> 00:12:12,701
We were working together.

285
00:12:12,703 --> 00:12:14,769
On Belphegor's.
What?!

286
00:12:14,771 --> 00:12:16,705
He was a numerical analyst
at the Tory Foundation.

287
00:12:16,707 --> 00:12:17,873
I work mostly in combinatorics.

288
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,307
I thought we would make
a good team.

289
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:20,742
But there aren't
supposed to be teams.

290
00:12:20,744 --> 00:12:22,711
Not in a puzzle hunt.
It's bad form.

291
00:12:22,713 --> 00:12:23,713
Harlan...

292
00:12:23,714 --> 00:12:25,514
I'm just saying...

293
00:12:25,516 --> 00:12:27,315
My husband
wouldn't understand,

294
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:30,385
so I decided I wouldn't tell him
until after we won the money.

295
00:12:30,387 --> 00:12:33,121
A team-- so that's how
you got there before me.

296
00:12:33,123 --> 00:12:34,489
I wasn't there.

297
00:12:34,491 --> 00:12:36,258
Tom and I were out of town
until this morning.

298
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,126
His cousin
was getting married in Hawaii.

299
00:12:38,128 --> 00:12:40,662
That's why Ike went
to the coordinates by himself.

300
00:12:40,664 --> 00:12:42,097
Because I couldn't.

301
00:12:44,268 --> 00:12:46,601
These are pictures I took.

302
00:12:46,603 --> 00:12:49,337
Check the dates.

303
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:51,506
You gave the police
nine other names?

304
00:12:51,508 --> 00:12:53,408
People you thought
were competing?

305
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,776
I've got 16.

306
00:12:54,778 --> 00:12:56,311
And I know they were competing.

307
00:12:58,448 --> 00:13:01,249
He talked to her
outside the Jamaica property

308
00:13:01,251 --> 00:13:05,720
for about 20 minutes,
and then this truck rolled up.

309
00:13:05,722 --> 00:13:07,822
Any idea what's
inside the crate?

310
00:13:07,824 --> 00:13:09,024
Nope.

311
00:13:09,026 --> 00:13:10,392
I can't identify
the woman either.

312
00:13:10,394 --> 00:13:12,260
Everything about her
said money though.

313
00:13:12,262 --> 00:13:15,363
She, Keswick
and the mystery box

314
00:13:15,365 --> 00:13:17,732
stayed inside the building
for about three hours,

315
00:13:17,734 --> 00:13:20,001
and then off they went.

316
00:13:20,904 --> 00:13:22,170
Good.

317
00:13:22,172 --> 00:13:23,872
Okay.

318
00:13:23,874 --> 00:13:26,074
You know where
to send the check.

319
00:13:26,076 --> 00:13:30,145
You haven't asked me about
the file Sherlock gave me.

320
00:13:30,147 --> 00:13:32,080
Why would I?

321
00:13:32,082 --> 00:13:36,184
You said it would give me
a better sense of you-- it did.

322
00:13:37,588 --> 00:13:40,155
That's why you asked
for my help.

323
00:13:40,157 --> 00:13:41,990
Because you felt sorry for me.

324
00:13:41,992 --> 00:13:44,226
No.

325
00:13:44,228 --> 00:13:46,194
You just don't seem interested
in anything

326
00:13:46,196 --> 00:13:48,063
outside of becoming
a detective.

327
00:13:48,065 --> 00:13:50,999
There she is.

328
00:13:51,001 --> 00:13:53,301
The old counselor.

329
00:13:53,303 --> 00:13:55,637
Who used to hold
Sherlock's hand.

330
00:13:57,608 --> 00:13:59,741
Everything that you read,

331
00:13:59,743 --> 00:14:02,510
everything that happened to me,
that's all it is.

332
00:14:02,512 --> 00:14:04,646
It's just something
that happened.

333
00:14:04,648 --> 00:14:08,116
And it's all
in the past now.

334
00:14:08,118 --> 00:14:10,685
So let's just
leave it there, shall we?

335
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:24,667
Hello.

336
00:14:24,668 --> 00:14:26,001
You've had sex.

337
00:14:26,003 --> 00:14:27,202
Excuse me?

338
00:14:27,204 --> 00:14:28,503
I can hear it
in your voice.

339
00:14:28,505 --> 00:14:29,771
You've joined paunches.

340
00:14:29,773 --> 00:14:30,972
Good for you, Watson.

341
00:14:30,974 --> 00:14:32,807
As you know, I think
the act of love

342
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:34,676
can be quite conducive to...
What do you want?

343
00:14:34,678 --> 00:14:36,911
Merely to apprise you
of a new development

344
00:14:36,913 --> 00:14:38,280
in the murder of
Ike Walaczek.

345
00:14:38,282 --> 00:14:40,115
As I informed
you yesterday,

346
00:14:40,117 --> 00:14:42,284
Harlan and I were given
a new list of competitors.

347
00:14:42,286 --> 00:14:45,320
One name leapt out:
Byron Lowenthal.

348
00:14:45,322 --> 00:14:48,156
He's a statistician at the
Public Utilities Commission

349
00:14:48,158 --> 00:14:50,425
and a diagnosed
paranoid schizophrenic.

350
00:14:50,427 --> 00:14:52,160
He's been hospitalized
for becoming violent

351
00:14:52,162 --> 00:14:53,728
on no fewer
than three occasions.

352
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,964
Certainly sounds like
it could be our guy.

353
00:14:55,966 --> 00:14:59,367
Unfortunately, Mr. Lowenthal had
another break earlier this year.

354
00:14:59,369 --> 00:15:02,137
He's been staying in
a transient hotel ever since.

355
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:04,239
Detective Bell and I
are going to speak with him.

356
00:15:04,241 --> 00:15:05,307
You want me to meet you?

357
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:06,875
Oh, no, we're already here.

358
00:15:06,877 --> 00:15:08,410
Anyway, now that I know
that you've enjoyed coitus

359
00:15:08,412 --> 00:15:09,778
and could enjoy more
in the near future...

360
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,846
When you're done,
we need to talk.

361
00:15:14,718 --> 00:15:16,818
Byron Lowenthal,
you in there?

362
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,053
Who is it?

363
00:15:18,055 --> 00:15:19,754
It's Detective Bell, NYPD.

364
00:15:19,756 --> 00:15:22,257
My colleague and I would like
to ask you some questions.

365
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:24,592
Let me
get some pants on.

366
00:15:37,341 --> 00:15:40,008
S-Sorry, I just... I, um...

367
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,310
I-I thought I heard
Mr. Lowenthal retr...

368
00:16:19,154 --> 00:16:21,267
You guys got lucky.

369
00:16:21,268 --> 00:16:22,868
Well, luck had little
to do with it, actually.

370
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,536
I... I heard Mr. Lowenthal

371
00:16:24,538 --> 00:16:27,039
pulling a heavy object off
a shelf, placing it on his bed,

372
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,041
and the sound of
the zipper indicated

373
00:16:29,043 --> 00:16:30,976
that it was
a large gun case.

374
00:16:30,978 --> 00:16:33,579
Looks like he was sane enough
to do math, but not much else.

375
00:16:33,581 --> 00:16:34,747
Plus, he was
pretty hopped up.

376
00:16:34,749 --> 00:16:36,448
Caffeine pills,
energy drinks,

377
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,251
pretty much every legal
stimulant you can buy.

378
00:16:39,253 --> 00:16:40,853
Plus a few illegal ones.

379
00:16:40,855 --> 00:16:42,821
Hmm. Obviously, he was
keeping himself awake

380
00:16:42,823 --> 00:16:44,490
so he could work on
Belphegor's.

381
00:16:44,492 --> 00:16:47,392
This... is obvious to you?

382
00:16:47,394 --> 00:16:48,961
I confess the maths
are beyond me,

383
00:16:48,963 --> 00:16:51,130
but I took the liberty of
sending pictures of what

384
00:16:51,132 --> 00:16:52,865
appear to be Mr. Lowenthal's
most recent scribbles

385
00:16:52,867 --> 00:16:54,166
to Harlan Emple,
and he's confirmed

386
00:16:54,168 --> 00:16:55,667
they are part of the contest.

387
00:16:55,669 --> 00:16:56,969
With your permission,
I'd like copies of these

388
00:16:56,971 --> 00:16:58,837
sent to my home
so he can review them.

389
00:16:58,839 --> 00:16:59,972
What for?

390
00:16:59,974 --> 00:17:01,073
If Byron Lowenthal

391
00:17:01,075 --> 00:17:02,441
did kill Ike Walaczek,

392
00:17:02,443 --> 00:17:04,109
then he used
and obscured a phone number,

393
00:17:04,111 --> 00:17:05,878
which would have yielded
the next problem.

394
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,379
That problem's solution

395
00:17:07,381 --> 00:17:08,714
would be GPS coordinates.

396
00:17:08,716 --> 00:17:10,415
If he's recorded them
in his books...

397
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:12,551
Your pal will be able to tell us
where he's headed next.

398
00:17:12,553 --> 00:17:14,853
I'll get our guys to give you

399
00:17:14,855 --> 00:17:16,388
whatever you need.

400
00:17:17,258 --> 00:17:18,991
Scans are still coming through,

401
00:17:18,993 --> 00:17:21,260
but I've put what we've got
so far up on the wall.

402
00:17:21,262 --> 00:17:23,262
Sherlock said that
you prefer it that way.

403
00:17:23,264 --> 00:17:25,030
Picked it up from him,
actually.

404
00:17:25,032 --> 00:17:28,600
Makes me feel like I'm really
inside of the problem.

405
00:17:30,704 --> 00:17:33,372
I'll, uh, let you know
if I need anything.

406
00:17:34,275 --> 00:17:35,974
Oh, I work without a shirt.

407
00:17:35,976 --> 00:17:38,911
Sometimes makes me feel
closer to the numbers.

408
00:17:38,913 --> 00:17:42,147
You'll need to, uh,
check the printer in the study

409
00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:43,615
for more pages.

410
00:17:43,617 --> 00:17:45,417
Uh, this is nice,
you know?

411
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:47,452
Meeting another member
of the team.

412
00:17:47,454 --> 00:17:48,654
You know, Team Sherlock.

413
00:17:48,656 --> 00:17:50,656
You help him, I help him...

414
00:17:51,926 --> 00:17:53,559
Obviously, you haven't
tackled a case

415
00:17:53,561 --> 00:17:55,093
with high-order math since
you started working with him,

416
00:17:55,095 --> 00:17:57,729
or we would've...

417
00:17:57,731 --> 00:17:59,031
What?

418
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:00,232
What?

419
00:18:00,234 --> 00:18:01,834
Wait...

420
00:18:01,836 --> 00:18:04,002
have you worked a case
with high-order math?

421
00:18:04,805 --> 00:18:06,238
You have, haven't you?

422
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,840
Does it matter?

423
00:18:07,842 --> 00:18:09,842
Of course it...

424
00:18:09,844 --> 00:18:11,443
Oh, my God.

425
00:18:11,445 --> 00:18:13,278
Did he fire me?

426
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,980
All I know
is that back in London,

427
00:18:14,982 --> 00:18:16,982
we worked a case that involved
Fibonacci spirals...

428
00:18:16,984 --> 00:18:18,483
He fired me.

429
00:18:18,485 --> 00:18:21,386
...and he called some woman
named Indira Patel.

430
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,856
She's at Berkeley.

431
00:18:23,858 --> 00:18:25,624
I'm three time zones closer!

432
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:27,125
You're here now.

433
00:18:27,127 --> 00:18:29,428
Sure, because I found
a dead body.

434
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,531
I have to go; I have to run
some errands for Sherlock.

435
00:18:35,936 --> 00:18:37,903
I-I don't know
what was in the crate,

436
00:18:37,905 --> 00:18:39,271
but the stenciling on
the side indicates

437
00:18:39,273 --> 00:18:40,772
it came from one of
the SUNY schools.

438
00:18:40,774 --> 00:18:42,908
I put another detective
on Keswick...

439
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:45,177
Don't kill me, I had to
use your razor to shave.

440
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:47,179
I...

441
00:18:47,181 --> 00:18:49,147
You must be Andrew.

442
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:50,515
Sherlock Holmes.

443
00:18:50,517 --> 00:18:52,551
Sorry.

444
00:18:52,553 --> 00:18:55,487
Joan said you were coming;
I... I forgot.

445
00:18:55,489 --> 00:18:57,122
It's not how
I wanted to meet you.

446
00:18:57,124 --> 00:18:58,891
She said you can tell
a lot about people

447
00:18:58,893 --> 00:19:00,192
just by looking at them.

448
00:19:00,194 --> 00:19:02,261
I swear, I...
usually wear pants.

449
00:19:02,263 --> 00:19:03,729
Well, in my experience,
most people

450
00:19:03,731 --> 00:19:05,264
need only be concerned
I won't notice

451
00:19:05,266 --> 00:19:06,498
anything worth remarking upon.

452
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:10,535
Watson seems adequately sexed.

453
00:19:11,939 --> 00:19:13,672
Hey.

454
00:19:13,674 --> 00:19:15,674
I was just introducing myself.

455
00:19:17,945 --> 00:19:20,379
I've got that thing.
I'll see you tonight.

456
00:19:20,381 --> 00:19:21,580
Okay.

457
00:19:27,855 --> 00:19:30,188
Your home, Watson...

458
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,823
it's utterly pleasant.

459
00:19:31,825 --> 00:19:33,692
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

460
00:19:33,694 --> 00:19:35,394
When you told me
you wanted a life of your own,

461
00:19:35,396 --> 00:19:36,595
I didn't realize
that you meant you wanted

462
00:19:36,597 --> 00:19:38,030
the same life everyone else has.

463
00:19:38,032 --> 00:19:39,464
But at any rate,
none of my business, is it?

464
00:19:39,466 --> 00:19:41,233
It's not.
And I didn't ask you here

465
00:19:41,235 --> 00:19:42,634
to talk about my apartment.

466
00:19:42,636 --> 00:19:44,970
No, you asked me here
to discuss Kitty.

467
00:19:44,972 --> 00:19:46,471
If she were not
the topic of conversation,

468
00:19:46,473 --> 00:19:48,941
then you wouldn't have
invited me to your home,

469
00:19:48,943 --> 00:19:50,776
where there's no chance
she'll be present.

470
00:19:52,346 --> 00:19:53,946
She disappointed you
in some way.

471
00:19:53,948 --> 00:19:55,247
Skills not up to snuff?

472
00:19:55,249 --> 00:19:57,316
Please remember
she is a novice.

473
00:19:57,318 --> 00:19:58,850
Actually, she did a great job.

474
00:19:58,852 --> 00:20:00,285
But I have some concerns.

475
00:20:00,287 --> 00:20:01,954
I thought we could
talk about them.

476
00:20:03,757 --> 00:20:04,923
You think that
Kitty needs help

477
00:20:04,925 --> 00:20:06,091
above and beyond
my mentorship.

478
00:20:06,093 --> 00:20:07,392
You read the same
file I did.

479
00:20:07,394 --> 00:20:08,894
She's a rape victim.

480
00:20:08,896 --> 00:20:11,296
She was kept and tortured.

481
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,899
Mm.

482
00:20:16,136 --> 00:20:19,171
You know me, so surely you know

483
00:20:19,173 --> 00:20:22,874
I've broached the subject of
a support group meeting before.

484
00:20:22,876 --> 00:20:25,010
Even offered
to pay for therapy.

485
00:20:25,012 --> 00:20:26,812
She's not interested, I know.

486
00:20:26,814 --> 00:20:28,447
Just as you also know

487
00:20:28,449 --> 00:20:30,749
someone with a problem
can't be forced to get help.

488
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:32,551
They have to want it.

489
00:20:32,553 --> 00:20:34,786
What Kitty wants
is to be a detective.

490
00:20:36,523 --> 00:20:38,490
I am taking pains
to try and channel

491
00:20:38,492 --> 00:20:40,592
her residual feelings
into her work.

492
00:20:42,329 --> 00:20:44,463
Well, that works out
great for you.

493
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:48,400
You told me that
you took on a partner

494
00:20:48,402 --> 00:20:50,635
because you wanted to replicate
what you and I had.

495
00:20:50,637 --> 00:20:52,637
That you thought it helped
with your recovery.

496
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:54,539
You think I would
try and take advantage

497
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,208
of the victim of a trauma?

498
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,910
Of course not, but there is
a conflict of interest here.

499
00:20:58,912 --> 00:21:02,447
She needs what she needs,
but you need what you need, too.

500
00:21:06,053 --> 00:21:10,055
It's-it's good that you're
in her life now, Watson.

501
00:21:10,057 --> 00:21:12,524
I mean,
it's commonly believed that, um,

502
00:21:12,526 --> 00:21:16,228
a child benefits mostly from
the presence of two parents.

503
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,164
He-- or she, in this case--
can absorb certain qualities

504
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,466
from the father--
clear-eyed view of the world,

505
00:21:21,468 --> 00:21:23,168
capacity of
rational thought, etcetera.

506
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,170
They can also absorb certain
qualities from the mother.

507
00:21:25,172 --> 00:21:27,105
Excuse me, but I am not
Kitty's mother,

508
00:21:27,107 --> 00:21:28,807
and she sure as hell
is not our child.

509
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:30,942
You brought her here;
she looks up to you.

510
00:21:30,944 --> 00:21:32,944
She says that she doesn't
need help-- fine--

511
00:21:32,946 --> 00:21:34,579
but you know better.

512
00:21:34,581 --> 00:21:37,082
And you're gonna have to be
the one that tells her.

513
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,620
It's Harlan.

514
00:21:41,622 --> 00:21:44,523
Making progress with the maths.

515
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,660
We thought
that Byron and Ike

516
00:21:48,662 --> 00:21:50,462
arrived at Portal Ten
simultaneously.

517
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,664
That would've meant that they
were doing all the same math

518
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,032
at essentially
the same time.

519
00:21:54,034 --> 00:21:56,001
Only, the math
you found at Byron's place

520
00:21:56,003 --> 00:21:57,003
says that's wrong.

521
00:21:57,004 --> 00:21:58,470
He was one step behind Ike.

522
00:21:58,472 --> 00:22:00,705
Are you proposing he did
not kill Mr. Walaczek?

523
00:22:00,707 --> 00:22:03,175
I don't know, but that's
not the weirdest part.

524
00:22:03,177 --> 00:22:04,810
Byron was obsessive.

525
00:22:04,812 --> 00:22:06,211
He time-stamped
almost everything he did.

526
00:22:06,213 --> 00:22:09,047
He only solved
the Portal Nine problem,

527
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:11,316
the same problem that sent me
to that old factory last night.

528
00:22:11,318 --> 00:22:12,884
But get this--

529
00:22:12,886 --> 00:22:14,686
he wasn't given
the same problem as me.

530
00:22:14,688 --> 00:22:16,655
And so it would've yielded
GPS coordinates

531
00:22:16,657 --> 00:22:18,323
for an entirely
different location.

532
00:22:18,325 --> 00:22:21,760
The person in charge of
the game changed the clue

533
00:22:21,762 --> 00:22:23,328
after the police
found Ike's body.

534
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:25,964
Well, he had to, right?

535
00:22:25,966 --> 00:22:27,899
If he hadn't, he would be
sending other competitors

536
00:22:27,901 --> 00:22:29,101
to an active crime scene.

537
00:22:29,103 --> 00:22:30,402
The important thing is

538
00:22:30,404 --> 00:22:31,536
I figured out the coordinates

539
00:22:31,538 --> 00:22:32,771
to the second location.

540
00:22:32,773 --> 00:22:35,540
I know where Byron went.

541
00:22:35,542 --> 00:22:36,842
What are you doing?

542
00:22:36,844 --> 00:22:38,410
You're saying he
time-stamped everything.

543
00:22:38,412 --> 00:22:40,345
I'm looking at the time
he received his clues.

544
00:22:40,347 --> 00:22:42,647
It's all there, to the second,
but what does that have to do...

545
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:44,149
What if you hadn't
found a body?

546
00:22:44,151 --> 00:22:46,118
If the game had
proceeded as planned,

547
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,486
what were you meant
to do there?

548
00:22:47,488 --> 00:22:49,354
I would have sent a text
to the phone number,

549
00:22:49,356 --> 00:22:51,523
the one that the killer painted
over, and then I would have

550
00:22:51,525 --> 00:22:52,891
gotten a message back
with the next problem.

551
00:22:52,893 --> 00:22:54,559
There's an extra
step in there.

552
00:22:54,561 --> 00:22:56,428
Why all this rigmarole with
phone numbers and texts?

553
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,064
Why not just post the problem
itself at the factory?

554
00:22:59,066 --> 00:23:02,100
I don't know, it's just the way
the game is played.

555
00:23:02,102 --> 00:23:04,102
They're for an old
industrial area in Queens.

556
00:23:04,104 --> 00:23:06,805
You're welcome
for finding your suspect.

557
00:23:06,807 --> 00:23:09,207
If I'm right, Harlan,
what you've found...

558
00:23:09,209 --> 00:23:11,109
is the site of
another murder.

559
00:23:11,111 --> 00:23:13,245
Byron Lowenthal's.

560
00:23:15,983 --> 00:23:18,216
You were right,
Lowenthal's dead.

561
00:23:18,218 --> 00:23:20,952
He was shot in the foot,
then the knee.

562
00:23:20,954 --> 00:23:22,821
Just like
Ike Wallaczek.

563
00:23:22,823 --> 00:23:26,391
I'm, uh, gonna look
over here now.

564
00:23:26,393 --> 00:23:29,427
Well, we think the perp
was pulling the body

565
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:31,429
to a car that was parked
over there.

566
00:23:31,431 --> 00:23:34,065
Then he just
left him here.

567
00:23:34,067 --> 00:23:35,901
Probably afraid
he'd been spotted.

568
00:23:35,903 --> 00:23:38,803
There's a lot
of homeless in the area.

569
00:23:41,441 --> 00:23:43,008
Question is:

570
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:45,010
how'd you know
Lowenthal was the next victim

571
00:23:45,012 --> 00:23:46,511
and not the killer?

572
00:23:49,316 --> 00:23:51,750
Well, that's
quite simple, really.

573
00:23:51,752 --> 00:23:54,352
The game is directing
its players to remote locales,

574
00:23:54,354 --> 00:23:56,788
and then instructing them
to send a text message

575
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,256
indicating their presence.

576
00:23:58,258 --> 00:24:00,125
I suspect the killer wanted
to remove the body

577
00:24:00,127 --> 00:24:02,928
so he could keep this new
location “in play,” so to speak.

578
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:05,130
Still missing the “simple” part.

579
00:24:05,132 --> 00:24:06,698
The late Mr. Lowenthal

580
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,366
received his final clue

581
00:24:08,368 --> 00:24:10,235
after Harlan discovered
Ike Wallaczek's body,

582
00:24:10,237 --> 00:24:12,737
but before news of the killing
had reached the media.

583
00:24:12,739 --> 00:24:14,439
That means the
game's designer

584
00:24:14,441 --> 00:24:16,408
knew the location
had been compromised.

585
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,577
And the only way
that he could have known that,

586
00:24:18,579 --> 00:24:20,111
at the time that he knew it,

587
00:24:20,113 --> 00:24:21,880
was if he, himself,
was the killer.

588
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,917
Belphegor's Prime is not
a treasure hunt.

589
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,619
It's a trap.

590
00:24:40,696 --> 00:24:42,196
Better?

591
00:24:42,198 --> 00:24:44,665
False alarm.

592
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:47,668
But I still feel
a little queasy.

593
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,273
This new dead guy--

594
00:24:52,275 --> 00:24:54,875
your friend said that he was
tortured, too, right?

595
00:24:54,877 --> 00:24:57,244
Right before the killer tried
to abscond with his corpse.

596
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:59,213
I assume
he intended to take

597
00:24:59,215 --> 00:25:02,383
Ike Wallaczek away with him
as well, only Ike was too large.

598
00:25:02,385 --> 00:25:04,685
A speedy mothballing
was the best he could do.

599
00:25:04,687 --> 00:25:07,221
So, just to recap,

600
00:25:07,223 --> 00:25:09,657
I've spent the last
few months of my life

601
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:13,360
playing a game that was
designed to kill me.

602
00:25:13,362 --> 00:25:15,629
Got to be a metaphor
in there somewhere, right?

603
00:25:15,631 --> 00:25:18,966
I think the word you're
looking for is “moral.”

604
00:25:18,968 --> 00:25:21,902
There is a moral in there:
games are for idiots.

605
00:25:24,707 --> 00:25:26,473
Breaking news from Ramapo.

606
00:25:26,475 --> 00:25:29,443
Kitty reports the Center for
Applied Mathematics and Logic

607
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,912
is not the sponsor
of Belphegor's Prime.

608
00:25:31,914 --> 00:25:34,148
Then it's got to be
a serial killer, right?

609
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,716
Someone who's obsessed
with mathematicians?

610
00:25:35,718 --> 00:25:37,284
Mm.

611
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,920
Perhaps he was bullied
by mathematicians as a child.

612
00:25:39,922 --> 00:25:42,056
Or mathematicians
killed his parents.

613
00:25:42,058 --> 00:25:43,657
I'm being serious.

614
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:45,726
Serial killers who devise
elaborate death traps

615
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,461
are the stuff of pulp fiction.

616
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:49,229
And besides, with respect
to these murders,

617
00:25:49,231 --> 00:25:51,165
there are none
of the elaborations

618
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:53,767
which mark that sort of culprit.

619
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:55,970
If anything, I would describe
the work as businesslike.

620
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:58,172
Then it's the government.

621
00:25:58,174 --> 00:26:01,241
I mean, the-the game was some
sort of test to weed out people

622
00:26:01,243 --> 00:26:03,243
who could weaponize math.

623
00:26:03,245 --> 00:26:05,179
The American intelligence
apparatus may be clod-like,

624
00:26:05,181 --> 00:26:07,014
but I think they would
do a better job

625
00:26:07,016 --> 00:26:08,749
of disposing of two bodies,
don't you?

626
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:11,785
Watson?

627
00:26:11,787 --> 00:26:13,621
I just heard
from one of the suspects

628
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:14,922
Marcus and I talked to
yesterday,

629
00:26:14,924 --> 00:26:16,290
another puzzle-hunter.

630
00:26:16,292 --> 00:26:18,525
Tell me he confessed
to the murders.

631
00:26:18,527 --> 00:26:20,427
We ruled him out right away,
but he heard about

632
00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:22,329
Byron Lowenthal's murder on
the news and wanted me to know

633
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:25,165
he's at a friend's place,
some guy named Paul.

634
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,934
That is fascinating.

635
00:26:26,936 --> 00:26:28,369
Actually, it might be.

636
00:26:28,371 --> 00:26:31,038
Paul is positive he knows
who the killer is.

637
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,807
I know the guards
are a bit much,

638
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:35,509
but I wanted everyone
to feel safe.

639
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:38,178
And, besides,
math has been good to me.

640
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,279
Commodities.

641
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:40,848
So, you and your friends,

642
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:43,150
you were competitors
in Belphegor's Prime?

643
00:26:43,152 --> 00:26:45,352
Most of us. Some of the others
are just here for the math.

644
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,121
You said you could
identify the killer.

645
00:26:47,123 --> 00:26:49,323
I can, sort of.

646
00:26:52,061 --> 00:26:54,194
“Mo Shellshocker.”

647
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:56,930
It's a pseudonym,
obviously, but I'm telling you,

648
00:26:56,932 --> 00:26:58,365
this is the guy
you're looking for.

649
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,600
I've heard of him.

650
00:26:59,602 --> 00:27:01,335
He uses his blog
to expose bad math.

651
00:27:01,337 --> 00:27:03,837
Corrupt economists, biased
pollsters, that sort of thing.

652
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:05,572
He's actually
sort of a crusader.

653
00:27:05,574 --> 00:27:06,574
He's a murderer.

654
00:27:06,575 --> 00:27:09,143
How can you be
so sure?

655
00:27:09,145 --> 00:27:10,744
When he isn't crusading,
he's competing in puzzle hunts.

656
00:27:10,746 --> 00:27:11,812
A few months ago,

657
00:27:11,814 --> 00:27:13,080
he claimed to
have solved

658
00:27:13,082 --> 00:27:14,815
Cicada 3301 two
years in a row.

659
00:27:14,817 --> 00:27:17,484
Some people called BS,
including...

660
00:27:17,486 --> 00:27:20,120
Ike Wallaczek
and Byron Lowenthal.

661
00:27:20,122 --> 00:27:21,221
“WallaCheckYourMath,”

662
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:22,489
“ByLow2020.”

663
00:27:22,491 --> 00:27:23,757
Those are their
online handles.

664
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:25,392
Their friends
will confirm it.

665
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,528
A flame war does not
a murderer make.

666
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:30,097
The stuff these guys were
slinging at each other was ugly.

667
00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:32,099
Mo knew they were into hunts,
and so he built one

668
00:27:32,101 --> 00:27:34,034
that would send them to places
where he could kill them.

669
00:27:34,036 --> 00:27:35,469
That's what we're
doing here is

670
00:27:35,471 --> 00:27:36,837
we're just sifting
through all the math

671
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:38,338
he's posted on his blog
over the years,

672
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,840
to see if we could
find his signature

673
00:27:39,842 --> 00:27:41,975
or something that
could identify him.

674
00:27:41,977 --> 00:27:45,279
If two people weren't dead,
we'd probably be having fun.

675
00:27:45,281 --> 00:27:46,747
But still, the
chances that he left

676
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:48,582
something like that
in his math...

677
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,784
If it's there, we'll find it.
In the meantime,

678
00:27:50,786 --> 00:27:52,186
we thought the
police should know

679
00:27:52,188 --> 00:27:53,687
who they're really
dealing with.

680
00:27:53,689 --> 00:27:55,389
<i>I've got to go meet someone</i>

681
00:27:55,391 --> 00:27:56,924
about my other case.

682
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:59,927
You're good to pass all this
along to Marcus? Okay.

683
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:03,030
I must say, I'm surprised you
didn't offer to stay and help.

684
00:28:03,032 --> 00:28:05,265
Mr. Ettinger makes
a compelling case with respect

685
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,067
to Mo Shellshocker's
viability as a suspect.

686
00:28:07,069 --> 00:28:09,002
Mo is a genius.

687
00:28:09,004 --> 00:28:10,637
We're talking off the charts.

688
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:12,139
Leibniz meets Euler meets Gauss.

689
00:28:12,141 --> 00:28:14,108
Huh.
He may have an ego,

690
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,110
but he's not gonna kill
anyone over a few comments.

691
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:18,312
So, while “The League of
Concerned Mathematician”"

692
00:28:18,314 --> 00:28:21,014
chases its tail up there, I
am gonna do the smart thing

693
00:28:21,016 --> 00:28:22,416
and get out of town.

694
00:28:22,418 --> 00:28:24,485
You can let me know
when it all blows over.

695
00:28:24,487 --> 00:28:26,386
You're not going
anywhere, Harlan.

696
00:28:26,388 --> 00:28:29,223
Or should I call you
Mo Shellshocker?

697
00:28:32,728 --> 00:28:34,661
Did you honestly think
I wouldn't recognize

698
00:28:34,663 --> 00:28:36,130
an anagram of my own name?

699
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:40,567
I knew I should've gone
with “Choker Hell Moss”"

700
00:28:40,569 --> 00:28:42,569
But I never thought
that you would see it, okay?

701
00:28:42,571 --> 00:28:44,104
Math is my thing, not yours.

702
00:28:44,106 --> 00:28:46,473
It's my name, Harlan;
that makes it my thing.

703
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,675
It was an homage.

704
00:28:48,677 --> 00:28:50,043
Explain.

705
00:28:50,045 --> 00:28:52,045
Every day, all over the world,

706
00:28:52,047 --> 00:28:54,348
math is used to trick people.

707
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,917
Data dredging to sell
pharmaceuticals.

708
00:28:56,919 --> 00:28:59,720
Publication bias
to justify wars.

709
00:28:59,722 --> 00:29:02,322
In the wrong hands, math can be
manipulated, abused.

710
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:05,425
And I decided to do
something about it.

711
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:09,596
You catch people
who murder other people.

712
00:29:09,598 --> 00:29:11,431
I catch people who murder math.

713
00:29:11,433 --> 00:29:14,568
According to this,
Mo is a wanted man.

714
00:29:17,606 --> 00:29:19,940
Harlan?

715
00:29:19,942 --> 00:29:23,110
The D.O.D. was working
on a new fighter.

716
00:29:23,112 --> 00:29:27,047
Only, I knew that the
performance stats were bogus.

717
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:29,116
A friend of mine found
the internal numbers,

718
00:29:29,118 --> 00:29:31,251
and I sort of published them.

719
00:29:31,253 --> 00:29:33,320
So you put classified
Department of Defense documents

720
00:29:33,322 --> 00:29:34,888
on the Internet.

721
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:36,623
Isn't that what
you would have done?

722
00:29:38,928 --> 00:29:41,562
Fine! I screwed up, okay?

723
00:29:41,564 --> 00:29:43,730
But, hey, that's what I do,
right? I screw up.

724
00:29:43,732 --> 00:29:46,233
If I didn't, then probably you
wouldn't have secretly fired me.

725
00:29:46,235 --> 00:29:47,968
Excuse me?

726
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,403
I know about Indira Patel!

727
00:29:51,006 --> 00:29:53,340
I know you replaced me.

728
00:29:55,144 --> 00:29:58,979
Kitty, I think
we could use some tea.

729
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:04,318
Just tell me.

730
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,253
Tell me what math I got wrong.

731
00:30:06,255 --> 00:30:09,356
Tell me why you didn't let me
make it up to you.

732
00:30:09,358 --> 00:30:12,926
It wasn't the maths, it was you.

733
00:30:14,763 --> 00:30:18,232
Your work was impeccable.

734
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:20,334
And for the most part,
I enjoyed our collaborations.

735
00:30:20,336 --> 00:30:24,838
B-But over time, you just...
you became quite... needy.

736
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,406
What are you talking about?

737
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:29,109
Y-You asked my advice
on-on social matters,

738
00:30:29,111 --> 00:30:32,512
and you even invited me
to a party.

739
00:30:32,514 --> 00:30:34,648
You were my friend.

740
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,416
I was your employer, Harlan.

741
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:37,918
A-And you were my consultant.

742
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,419
One of many.

743
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:43,757
I know that I'm a little
obsessed with what I do.

744
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:46,960
That has always made it hard
to make friends.

745
00:30:46,962 --> 00:30:50,664
And I used to feel pretty bad
about that, and then I met you.

746
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:52,566
And I thought to myself,

747
00:30:52,568 --> 00:30:55,903
hey, if it doesn't bother him,
why should I let it bother me?

748
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:03,810
I got a lot
out of the work that we did.

749
00:31:03,812 --> 00:31:06,146
A lot.

750
00:31:06,148 --> 00:31:11,218
But if someone like you thinks
that I'm a loser, then...

751
00:31:22,564 --> 00:31:24,965
Hey, are we still doing this?

752
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:26,366
Doing what?

753
00:31:26,368 --> 00:31:28,502
Talking about the case.

754
00:31:28,504 --> 00:31:30,070
You're just sitting there.

755
00:31:30,072 --> 00:31:32,105
I'm thinking.

756
00:31:32,107 --> 00:31:34,308
I suspect the silence
is exacerbated

757
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,143
by the nature
of our communication.

758
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:37,811
Yes. Well, I don't
live there anymore.

759
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,713
So, if you want
to talk shop at night,

760
00:31:39,715 --> 00:31:41,515
this is the best I can do.

761
00:31:41,517 --> 00:31:45,252
Keep asking myself:
what did the killer want?

762
00:31:45,254 --> 00:31:48,255
He went to great lengths to lure
brilliant mathematicians

763
00:31:48,257 --> 00:31:49,489
to their deaths.

764
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,525
Winnowed out
the less gifted

765
00:31:51,527 --> 00:31:54,061
by making his problems
more and more complicated.

766
00:31:54,063 --> 00:31:57,597
He had a type, but I still think
he's a serial killer

767
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:59,266
only in the most
technical sense.

768
00:31:59,268 --> 00:32:01,201
He tortured both his victims.

769
00:32:01,203 --> 00:32:02,936
But there's no sign
that he enjoyed it.

770
00:32:02,938 --> 00:32:04,538
The work was
utilitarian,

771
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,740
suggesting it was
less for pleasure

772
00:32:06,742 --> 00:32:10,043
and more for persuasion.

773
00:32:10,045 --> 00:32:11,945
He wanted something.

774
00:32:11,947 --> 00:32:13,714
But what?

775
00:32:13,716 --> 00:32:16,483
Maybe there's a connection
between Wallaczek and Lowenthal

776
00:32:16,485 --> 00:32:18,418
we haven't spotted yet.

777
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,220
Maybe they were working
on a project together,

778
00:32:20,222 --> 00:32:21,822
something that was worth
a lot of money.

779
00:32:21,824 --> 00:32:23,857
There's no way the killer
could have predicted

780
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:26,093
which competitors would make it
to the terminal stage.

781
00:32:26,095 --> 00:32:28,795
That part of the game
was beyond his control.

782
00:32:28,797 --> 00:32:30,664
If it weren't,
he would've been prepared

783
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:33,300
to dispose of a body
the size of Ike Wallaczek's.

784
00:32:33,302 --> 00:32:35,335
So, even if there were a
connection between the victims,

785
00:32:35,337 --> 00:32:37,070
the killer could not
have counted on them

786
00:32:37,072 --> 00:32:38,839
being lured into his trap.

787
00:32:38,841 --> 00:32:41,041
Certainly not
in sequence.

788
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:45,112
His game was, in many respects,
one of chance.

789
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:51,718
Suggesting he knows what
he wants, but not who has it.

790
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,888
Like he was on a puzzle hunt
of his own.

791
00:32:56,825 --> 00:32:58,859
I'm back.

792
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:05,665
I'll set up
downstairs, yeah?

793
00:33:09,138 --> 00:33:11,238
I've been thinking about
what you said earlier.

794
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,740
I've decided to engage her
one more time

795
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:15,609
with regards
to her recuperation.

796
00:33:17,112 --> 00:33:21,815
I doubt she'll listen,
but I'll keep you apprised.

797
00:33:25,954 --> 00:33:27,421
I've been thinking.

798
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:29,623
About?
You. Your history.

799
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:31,825
Your decision
not to seek help.

800
00:33:31,827 --> 00:33:34,594
I think it's
a mistake.

801
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,530
Oh?

802
00:33:36,532 --> 00:33:38,198
I've looked into a number
of support groups.

803
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,633
As you are well aware,

804
00:33:39,635 --> 00:33:41,701
I have benefited greatly
from similar settings.

805
00:33:41,703 --> 00:33:43,270
You have.

806
00:33:43,272 --> 00:33:44,638
The process, I find,

807
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,906
is not unlike
voiding one's bowels...

808
00:33:45,908 --> 00:33:47,808
I'll go.
What?

809
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:49,676
I'll go.
Just get me the details.

810
00:33:52,014 --> 00:33:55,182
I've been thinking, too-- about
your number-cruncher, Harlan.

811
00:33:55,184 --> 00:33:57,017
You think I was
too hard on him.

812
00:33:57,019 --> 00:33:58,685
You will have consultants
of your own one day.

813
00:33:58,687 --> 00:34:01,488
You'll see that they require
management and focus.

814
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:04,124
They are but keys on a keyboard,
and we're the typists.

815
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:06,159
You could've given him
a shoeing for all I care.

816
00:34:06,161 --> 00:34:07,828
No, I'm just saying that

817
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:10,030
some of the stuff he's got
up to, it's quite good.

818
00:34:10,032 --> 00:34:11,698
You should take a look.

819
00:34:13,368 --> 00:34:15,735
You may find a fellow typist.

820
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,076
Hello?

821
00:34:23,078 --> 00:34:25,312
Yeah, I
hear that you and some friends

822
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:27,848
are trying to identify
Mo Shellshocker.

823
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,649
That's right. Who is this?

824
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:32,719
His name is Harlan Emple.

825
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:34,020
You got a pen?

826
00:34:34,022 --> 00:34:36,456
I'll-I'll give you his address.

827
00:34:52,454 --> 00:34:54,020
Harlan.

828
00:34:54,022 --> 00:34:56,356
You can't take a hint, can you?

829
00:34:56,358 --> 00:34:57,657
I got your text messages.

830
00:34:57,659 --> 00:34:58,958
I don't want to see you
right now.

831
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,827
So if you came here
to apologize...

832
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:03,363
Actually, I came here
to spare you an agonizing death.

833
00:35:04,299 --> 00:35:05,832
Can I come in?

834
00:35:05,834 --> 00:35:08,301
I was puzzling earlier

835
00:35:08,303 --> 00:35:12,038
as to why the killer went
to such specific lengths.

836
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,606
What did he want?

837
00:35:13,608 --> 00:35:15,809
And then Watson,
quite by accident,

838
00:35:15,811 --> 00:35:17,410
she made a most
compelling analogy.

839
00:35:17,412 --> 00:35:20,080
She said it was as if he
was on a hunt of his own.

840
00:35:20,082 --> 00:35:22,615
Duh. He was hunting
mathematicians.

841
00:35:22,617 --> 00:35:23,783
No, he wasn't.

842
00:35:23,785 --> 00:35:25,151
He was hunting<i> a</i> mathematician.

843
00:35:25,153 --> 00:35:26,619
One.

844
00:35:26,621 --> 00:35:29,389
A man who had concealed
his identity not only

845
00:35:29,391 --> 00:35:31,191
from the mathematics
community at large,

846
00:35:31,193 --> 00:35:32,859
but also from the FBI.

847
00:35:32,861 --> 00:35:35,395
A “crusader,”
you might call him.

848
00:35:35,397 --> 00:35:36,763
Wait a minute.

849
00:35:36,765 --> 00:35:38,731
Are you saying that
this was all about me?

850
00:35:53,448 --> 00:35:56,449
<i> Unfortunately, emulating</i>
<i>the work of people like me</i>

851
00:35:56,451 --> 00:35:59,018
<i>is not without risks.</i>

852
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,320
Creates enemies.

853
00:36:00,322 --> 00:36:02,889
I knew it was the government.

854
00:36:02,891 --> 00:36:04,424
It was a lottery winner.

855
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,260
Little over a year ago,

856
00:36:07,262 --> 00:36:09,529
you started a series of blogs
where you exposed the flaws

857
00:36:09,531 --> 00:36:11,664
in certain scratch card
lottery games.

858
00:36:11,666 --> 00:36:13,766
Tickets like this one.

859
00:36:13,768 --> 00:36:15,802
I wrote about
baited hook games.

860
00:36:15,804 --> 00:36:17,971
Games where the numbers
are printed on the front.

861
00:36:17,973 --> 00:36:20,707
Scratch off the hidden numbers,
hope for a match.

862
00:36:20,709 --> 00:36:23,309
Only, you proved that with
careful mathematical analysis

863
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:25,512
of the visible numbers,
you could predict

864
00:36:25,514 --> 00:36:28,381
which tickets were winners
80% of the time.

865
00:36:28,383 --> 00:36:29,682
If you had exploited

866
00:36:29,684 --> 00:36:32,085
this flaw,
rather than exposing it,

867
00:36:32,087 --> 00:36:33,520
you could have made millions.

868
00:36:33,522 --> 00:36:36,022
Well... sure.
But that would been cheating.

869
00:36:36,024 --> 00:36:37,157
Right.

870
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:38,825
So imagine
for a moment

871
00:36:38,827 --> 00:36:41,060
that you are a less
honest mathematician.

872
00:36:41,062 --> 00:36:42,495
Right?

873
00:36:42,497 --> 00:36:44,063
You've been taking
advantage of these games

874
00:36:44,065 --> 00:36:47,967
for a couple of years to
amass a small fortune.

875
00:36:47,969 --> 00:36:49,502
And then “Mo"
comes along.

876
00:36:49,504 --> 00:36:51,971
He starts exposing
the broken games.

877
00:36:51,973 --> 00:36:54,340
State lottery commissions
shut them down.

878
00:36:54,342 --> 00:36:56,976
The exploitable
games dry up.

879
00:36:56,978 --> 00:37:00,613
Now, if you were a
psychopathic lottery cheat,

880
00:37:00,615 --> 00:37:02,582
how do you fix that?

881
00:37:02,584 --> 00:37:04,484
You kill Mo.

882
00:37:04,486 --> 00:37:07,253
<i>Unfortunately, Mo is elusive.</i>

883
00:37:07,255 --> 00:37:08,821
<i>Anonymous.</i>

884
00:37:08,823 --> 00:37:11,224
The only thing
he knew about him for sure

885
00:37:11,226 --> 00:37:14,394
was that he could not resist
a puzzle hunt.

886
00:37:14,396 --> 00:37:17,130
Now, if you were smart enough
to identify

887
00:37:17,132 --> 00:37:19,399
and take advantage of
broken lottery games...

888
00:37:19,401 --> 00:37:21,868
Then I'm smart enough
to design a puzzle hunt.

889
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:25,338
This plan was not
without its flaws.

890
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:28,775
Once a competitor
reached the terminal stage,

891
00:37:28,777 --> 00:37:32,745
the killer could not be certain
that he'd trapped Mo, could he?

892
00:37:32,747 --> 00:37:34,480
So he tortured them.

893
00:37:34,482 --> 00:37:37,083
I submit he forced them to
log on to Mo's Web site,

894
00:37:37,085 --> 00:37:39,686
and when they failed...

895
00:37:41,323 --> 00:37:42,755
After two murders,

896
00:37:42,757 --> 00:37:44,290
the game was compromised.

897
00:37:44,292 --> 00:37:46,192
So the killer devises
a Plan “B.”

898
00:37:46,194 --> 00:37:47,460
He tricks

899
00:37:47,462 --> 00:37:49,229
a group of his peers

900
00:37:49,231 --> 00:37:51,097
into helping search
for an alternative means

901
00:37:51,099 --> 00:37:53,032
of identifying Mo.

902
00:37:56,504 --> 00:37:58,438
You're talking about that guy.

903
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,906
The one with the penthouse.

904
00:37:59,908 --> 00:38:02,742
<i>Paul?</i>

905
00:38:02,744 --> 00:38:05,044
Lottery winners
are public record.

906
00:38:05,046 --> 00:38:07,814
So when I searched for
the names of repeat winners

907
00:38:07,816 --> 00:38:09,482
in the dates prior
to your posts...

908
00:38:09,484 --> 00:38:11,317
I can't believe
I drank his water.

909
00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:12,685
I called him.

910
00:38:12,687 --> 00:38:14,654
I identified you as Mo.

911
00:38:14,656 --> 00:38:16,122
And I gave him your address.

912
00:38:16,124 --> 00:38:17,590
You what?!

913
00:38:21,129 --> 00:38:23,062
Drop your weapon!

914
00:38:23,064 --> 00:38:24,597
<i>I did not, however, give him</i>

915
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:25,965
<i>the correct apartment number.</i>

916
00:38:25,967 --> 00:38:28,334
He was arrested
a little over an hour ago.

917
00:38:30,739 --> 00:38:31,871
Tried to call you to
tell you, but, um...

918
00:38:31,873 --> 00:38:33,539
But I was ignoring you.

919
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:35,008
Yes, you were ignoring me.

920
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,209
Look, you know

921
00:38:36,211 --> 00:38:37,377
that I'm still screwed, right?

922
00:38:37,379 --> 00:38:39,279
You told him that I'm Mo.

923
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:42,115
He's gonna tell the police,
they're gonna tell the FBI...

924
00:38:42,117 --> 00:38:43,516
The NYPD is under
the impression

925
00:38:43,518 --> 00:38:45,385
that I lied about
your connection to Mo

926
00:38:45,387 --> 00:38:47,920
in order to draw
Mr. Ettinger out.

927
00:38:47,922 --> 00:38:49,555
As far as the
FBI goes, well,

928
00:38:49,557 --> 00:38:51,958
I've got some associates
who have created a trail

929
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,860
which will
strongly suggest that Mo

930
00:38:53,862 --> 00:38:55,728
is a cyber-terrorist
I became aware of

931
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:58,197
whilst working for, um...

932
00:38:58,199 --> 00:38:59,766
queen and country.

933
00:38:59,768 --> 00:39:02,135
Your secret's
quite safe.

934
00:39:02,137 --> 00:39:03,903
Thanks.

935
00:39:06,508 --> 00:39:09,776
My reasons for preserving you
are entirely selfish, Harlan.

936
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:13,279
You are a tremendous asset.

937
00:39:13,281 --> 00:39:15,815
I have little doubt

938
00:39:15,817 --> 00:39:19,118
I will need your help again
in the future.

939
00:39:26,461 --> 00:39:28,528
Me or him?

940
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:29,996
You.

941
00:39:29,998 --> 00:39:31,798
I have an update on
that real estate flipper.

942
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,433
I thought you might
want to know.

943
00:39:39,274 --> 00:39:41,908
I tracked down the truck rental
receipts to get her name.

944
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,142
Valerie Cork.

945
00:39:43,144 --> 00:39:44,911
She's an art authenticator.

946
00:39:44,913 --> 00:39:46,779
And that crate you saw?

947
00:39:46,781 --> 00:39:48,414
There was
something called

948
00:39:48,416 --> 00:39:50,683
a scanning fluorescence
spectrometry machine inside.

949
00:39:50,685 --> 00:39:52,251
They're used...
To find paintings

950
00:39:52,253 --> 00:39:53,553
underneath other paintings.

951
00:39:53,555 --> 00:39:55,288
So it turns out
that the building

952
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:56,689
Chad Keswick was looking to buy

953
00:39:56,691 --> 00:39:59,025
was leased by the WPA
during the Depression.

954
00:39:59,027 --> 00:40:00,927
They commissioned a
mural for the lobby.

955
00:40:00,929 --> 00:40:03,329
The artist was a
notorious communist,

956
00:40:03,331 --> 00:40:05,365
so when the property passed
into private hands in the '50s,

957
00:40:05,367 --> 00:40:06,999
the new owners
had it painted over.

958
00:40:07,001 --> 00:40:08,735
But it was still there,
under the paint.

959
00:40:08,737 --> 00:40:11,037
A lost work by Diego Rivera.

960
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:13,473
It's worth ten times
the price of the building.

961
00:40:14,676 --> 00:40:17,043
I was hoping to leak
the truth to the<i> Times.</i>

962
00:40:18,113 --> 00:40:20,046
I promised you a cut of my fee.

963
00:40:20,048 --> 00:40:22,148
But I'm pretty sure
the mural's gonna end up

964
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:24,384
in the hands of
a historical trust.

965
00:40:24,386 --> 00:40:26,352
I'd feel obligated
to refund my client,

966
00:40:26,354 --> 00:40:28,388
which means you'd get
a cut of nothing.

967
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:31,457
That works for me.

968
00:40:31,459 --> 00:40:33,493
Okay.

969
00:40:35,463 --> 00:40:37,397
I think you should know

970
00:40:37,399 --> 00:40:39,732
that I am going
to a meeting tonight.

971
00:40:41,803 --> 00:40:45,505
One of those
support groups for...

972
00:40:45,507 --> 00:40:47,340
people like me.

973
00:40:47,342 --> 00:40:49,876
It was, uh, Sherlock's idea.

974
00:40:49,878 --> 00:40:51,644
That's great.

975
00:40:51,646 --> 00:40:53,446
I know you put him up to it.

976
00:40:53,448 --> 00:40:55,381
We talked.

977
00:40:57,552 --> 00:41:00,219
When he first approached me
in London,

978
00:41:00,221 --> 00:41:03,556
I was...

979
00:41:03,558 --> 00:41:05,558
in a bad way.

980
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,227
And I had been for a while.

981
00:41:08,229 --> 00:41:11,130
But then,
when he talked about

982
00:41:11,132 --> 00:41:12,365
the work that he did,

983
00:41:12,367 --> 00:41:16,035
about the things
that he saw in me...

984
00:41:18,406 --> 00:41:19,739
I want it.

985
00:41:19,741 --> 00:41:21,874
I want every bit
of what's he offered me,

986
00:41:21,876 --> 00:41:23,843
of what he offered you, but...

987
00:41:23,845 --> 00:41:26,212
if I've learned one thing
over the last few weeks,

988
00:41:26,214 --> 00:41:28,047
it's that he can't pull it off.

989
00:41:28,049 --> 00:41:29,682
Not by himself, anyway.

990
00:41:31,586 --> 00:41:34,153
And if I'm gonna get
what I want,

991
00:41:34,155 --> 00:41:37,690
then I'm going to need
your help, too.

992
00:41:40,361 --> 00:41:42,829
I still think
the meetings are bollocks,

993
00:41:42,831 --> 00:41:44,931
but you say they're important.

994
00:41:44,933 --> 00:41:47,967
They matter to you, so...

995
00:41:47,969 --> 00:41:49,735
What do you say, Watson?

996
00:41:49,737 --> 00:41:52,071
Will you help me?

997
00:41:56,277 --> 00:41:58,244
I don't know how it happened.

998
00:41:58,246 --> 00:42:01,547
It just... hit me.

999
00:42:01,549 --> 00:42:03,983
Like a truck, out of nowhere.

1000
00:42:04,853 --> 00:42:07,753
Work is good.

1001
00:42:07,755 --> 00:42:09,755
I have friends.

1002
00:42:09,757 --> 00:42:13,092
I'm in a
relationship.

1003
00:42:13,094 --> 00:42:16,896
Somewhere along
the way, somehow,

1004
00:42:16,898 --> 00:42:19,732
I stopped being a victim

1005
00:42:19,734 --> 00:42:22,602
and became a survivor.

1006
00:42:22,604 --> 00:42:25,705
So, I guess all I'm saying is,
there's hope.

1007
00:42:26,357 --> 00:42:31,686
Do the work. Love yourself.
There's hope.

If you're looking for Sherlock,
he's downstairs.

3
00:00:04,785 --> 00:00:05,841
Okay.

4
00:00:05,842 --> 00:00:07,541
<i>His name is Harlan Emple.</i>

5
00:00:07,543 --> 00:00:09,176
<i>He is the Rachel P. Hanson</i>
<i>Professor</i>

6
00:00:09,178 --> 00:00:11,301
for Applied Mathematics
at Columbia University.

7
00:00:11,301 --> 00:00:14,502
What I don't get is
why he isn't wearing a shirt.

8
00:00:14,504 --> 00:00:17,372
He doesn't like anything to come
between him and the numbers.

9
00:00:17,374 --> 00:00:18,415
What is it?

10
00:00:18,438 --> 00:00:20,274
The answers to your questions
about Kitty.

11
00:00:20,276 --> 00:00:22,710
The truth is she was a
victim of a horrific crime.

12
00:00:22,712 --> 00:00:24,646
<i>After you left last night,</i>

13
00:00:24,648 --> 00:00:26,848
Sherlock gave me an envelope.

14
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,249
Sherlock keeps saying

15
00:00:28,251 --> 00:00:30,385
that I need to get
a better sense of you,

16
00:00:30,387 --> 00:00:33,021
and maybe that will give you
a better sense of me.

17
00:00:42,065 --> 00:00:43,065
It's open.

18
00:00:47,637 --> 00:00:49,003
It's nothing.

19
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:50,872
It's Sherlock and
one of his experts.

20
00:00:50,874 --> 00:00:52,006
Which one?

21
00:00:52,008 --> 00:00:53,241
Phillip something.

22
00:00:53,243 --> 00:00:54,575
Must be new.

23
00:00:54,577 --> 00:00:57,445
He's a knife-thrower.

24
00:00:57,447 --> 00:00:58,913
Why does Sherlock have
a knife-thrower?

25
00:00:58,915 --> 00:01:00,748
He got bored the other day,

26
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,185
started looking into this, uh,
circus accident from the '30s.

27
00:01:04,187 --> 00:01:07,922
The Great Galardo perforated one
of his assistants during an act,

28
00:01:07,924 --> 00:01:09,924
except Sherlock thinks
the blade was thrown

29
00:01:09,926 --> 00:01:11,492
by somebody in the stands,
not Galardo.

30
00:01:11,494 --> 00:01:15,096
Phillip, as far as I
can tell, disagrees.

31
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:18,900
It can't be done, okay?

32
00:01:18,902 --> 00:01:19,934
It was done.

33
00:01:19,936 --> 00:01:21,335
You're wrong.

34
00:01:21,337 --> 00:01:23,538
Nobody can chuck
a knife that far.

35
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,239
What's this?

36
00:01:25,241 --> 00:01:26,207
You're...

37
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:27,209
Not here.

38
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,509
I'm not here.

39
00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:29,711
Remember that, okay?

40
00:01:29,713 --> 00:01:31,279
Oh, yes. Heaven
forfend your work

41
00:01:31,281 --> 00:01:33,247
with me should endanger
your precious day job.

42
00:01:33,249 --> 00:01:35,116
You throw knives?

43
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,252
You know, it was supposed
to be just you here.

44
00:01:38,254 --> 00:01:41,355
Phillip is arguably the greatest
knife-thrower in the world.

45
00:01:41,357 --> 00:01:42,790
Has been for decades.

46
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:43,925
Only, there's little money

47
00:01:43,927 --> 00:01:45,193
to be made
in the impalement arts.

48
00:01:45,195 --> 00:01:46,494
So, as a youth, he turned

49
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,563
to what you Americans
term “football”"

50
00:01:48,565 --> 00:01:50,131
Is this a joke?

51
00:01:53,837 --> 00:01:55,002
Phillip, head
and heart.

52
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:56,904
Come on.
Head and heart.

53
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:06,814
Can I go?

54
00:02:06,816 --> 00:02:09,484
Yeah.

55
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,489
15 years he spent throwing
that misshapen ball around.

56
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:16,057
15 years.

57
00:02:16,059 --> 00:02:18,259
When I think of the acclaim
he could have brought

58
00:02:18,261 --> 00:02:20,828
to competitive blade slinging.

59
00:02:27,237 --> 00:02:29,036
You're following me,
Watson.

60
00:02:29,038 --> 00:02:30,338
I don't like it.

61
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,740
I want you to help
me with something.

62
00:02:32,742 --> 00:02:33,908
This is Chad Keswick.

63
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,976
He buys distressed
buildings,

64
00:02:34,978 --> 00:02:36,210
paints, spackles,

65
00:02:36,212 --> 00:02:37,645
and then flips them
for quick money.

66
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:39,180
Who'd he kill?
No one.

67
00:02:39,182 --> 00:02:41,315
I was hired by one of
his rivals to find out

68
00:02:41,317 --> 00:02:43,017
why he's been circling
this old office building

69
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:44,218
in Jamaica, Queens.

70
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,586
She wants to know
why he thinks

71
00:02:45,588 --> 00:02:47,355
the building is
a good investment.

72
00:02:47,357 --> 00:02:49,590
Is there a crime in there,
something worth investigating?

73
00:02:49,592 --> 00:02:50,925
Well, I've been
shadowing Keswick,

74
00:02:50,927 --> 00:02:52,593
but yesterday I think
he noticed me.

75
00:02:52,595 --> 00:02:54,595
I want to switch
up the tail.

76
00:02:54,597 --> 00:02:57,231
You followed me for over
a week before I noticed you.

77
00:02:57,233 --> 00:02:59,033
Help me out, and I'll
cut you in on my fee.

78
00:02:59,035 --> 00:03:02,003
I don't work for you,
I work for Sherlock.

79
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:03,437
I worked for him, too.

80
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,773
And, in my experience,
he was always supportive

81
00:03:05,775 --> 00:03:07,942
of taking on work
outside the partnership.

82
00:03:07,944 --> 00:03:10,912
Sorry, it's not my cup of tea.

83
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:33,034
Hello, Portal Ten.

84
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,247

Belphegor's Prime.

They're math games.

Math-- maybe you've heard of it.

I've got some math for you.

96

One dead guy

found in the same
deserted factory.

98
00:05:02,106 --> 00:05:06,108
I was not “found” there;
I am the one who called 911.

99
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,310
I was waiting there
for the police.

100
00:05:08,312 --> 00:05:09,745
Mr. Emple,

101
00:05:09,747 --> 00:05:11,613
we're just trying
to do our jobs, all right?

102
00:05:11,615 --> 00:05:13,048
First officers
on the scene described you

103
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,516
as “extremely agitated.”

104
00:05:14,518 --> 00:05:15,984
Well, of course
I was agitated.

105
00:05:15,986 --> 00:05:18,754
I had just found
a dead guy in mothballs!

106
00:05:18,756 --> 00:05:21,790
And did I mention that I have
not slept in almost two days?

107
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:23,358
Because of the math game.

108
00:05:24,762 --> 00:05:26,195
Can I borrow those?

109
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:31,100
This...

110
00:05:31,102 --> 00:05:33,302
is Belphegor's Prime, okay?

111
00:05:33,304 --> 00:05:35,304
It's a numeric palindrome.

112
00:05:35,306 --> 00:05:40,776
It's 666 bookended by 13 zeroes
and then bracketed with ones.

113
00:05:40,778 --> 00:05:43,846
Named for the demon Belphegor
who was a prince of hell.

114
00:05:43,848 --> 00:05:46,448
The first clue for the hunt
started making the rounds

115
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,883
a few months ago.

116
00:05:47,885 --> 00:05:49,651
It was a JPEG with two numbers
hidden in it.

117
00:05:49,653 --> 00:05:51,453
You divide those numbers
by Belphegor's Prime,

118
00:05:51,455 --> 00:05:54,890
and you get the GPS coordinates
for a restroom at the Bronx Zoo.

119
00:05:54,892 --> 00:05:56,959
You go to the restroom,
you find a phone number.

120
00:05:56,961 --> 00:05:58,927
You send a text to the number,
you get the next clue.

121
00:05:58,929 --> 00:05:59,962
Which is another math problem.

122
00:05:59,964 --> 00:06:00,929
Exactly.

123
00:06:00,931 --> 00:06:02,397
Only, this one is harder.

124
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,099
And that's how it works.

125
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:05,934
You know, but for
each one that you solve,

126
00:06:05,936 --> 00:06:08,103
you get a new set
of GPS coordinates.

127
00:06:08,105 --> 00:06:11,473
And that means that you've
completed a stage, or a portal.

128
00:06:11,475 --> 00:06:13,509
And last night,
I was on Portal Ten.

129
00:06:13,511 --> 00:06:15,711
And...

130
00:06:17,014 --> 00:06:18,313
You know what?

131
00:06:18,315 --> 00:06:20,015
I want to talk
to Sherlock and Joan.

132
00:06:20,017 --> 00:06:21,917
Look, Mr. Emple...
No, I'm sorry.

133
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,019
I told the police down
at the factory that I know them.

134
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:25,287
Isn't that the whole reason

135
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:26,922
that I was brought here
to this squad?

136
00:06:26,924 --> 00:06:30,392
I-I am not saying another word
until they are here.

137
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:35,264
Harlan Emple is
indeed an acquaintance.

138
00:06:35,266 --> 00:06:37,733
He is, in point of fact,
one of my “irregulars.”

139
00:06:37,735 --> 00:06:38,801
One of your what?

140
00:06:38,803 --> 00:06:40,302
Irregulars.

141
00:06:40,304 --> 00:06:41,770
I'm your consultant, Captain;
they are mine.

142
00:06:41,772 --> 00:06:43,572
They're a handful
of experts I turn to

143
00:06:43,574 --> 00:06:46,108
when I encounter problems which
are beyond my pool of knowledge.

144
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,810
Harlan is
a brilliant mathematician.

145
00:06:47,812 --> 00:06:49,778
And on the handful of occasions
I have tackled a case

146
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,046
which pertained
to mathematics...

147
00:06:51,048 --> 00:06:53,182
He helped you out.
Well, the good news

148
00:06:53,184 --> 00:06:56,018
for him is the preliminary
autopsy report just came in

149
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,252
before you got here.

150
00:06:57,254 --> 00:06:59,021
And the M.E. puts
the time of death

151
00:06:59,023 --> 00:07:00,989
between 4:00 and
6:00 p.m. last night.

152
00:07:00,991 --> 00:07:02,124
Mr. Emple was teaching

153
00:07:02,126 --> 00:07:03,358
a class at Columbia.

154
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,394
So the victim is
yet to be identified?

155
00:07:05,396 --> 00:07:07,663
No I.D., no phone.

156
00:07:07,665 --> 00:07:09,865
First detective on the scene
liked it for a mob hit,

157
00:07:09,867 --> 00:07:11,500
so while we're
running the prints,

158
00:07:11,502 --> 00:07:13,602
he's showing the vic's
face around OCID.

159
00:07:13,604 --> 00:07:16,839
Marcus here was about to walk
the scene with Mr. Emple.

160
00:07:16,841 --> 00:07:18,774
You're here now;
you might as well tag along.

161
00:07:18,776 --> 00:07:21,009
Actually, Captain,
I'm quite busy today.

162
00:07:21,011 --> 00:07:22,978
This is a John Doe,
and we got nothing.

163
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,247
And, like you just said,
you're my consultant.

164
00:07:25,249 --> 00:07:26,748
So, go consult.

165
00:07:29,787 --> 00:07:30,986
Watson.

166
00:07:30,988 --> 00:07:32,588
Um, he's your friend.

167
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,523
Actually, Kitty is
otherwise engaged,

168
00:07:34,525 --> 00:07:37,426
and he did actually help both
of us with a case last year.

169
00:07:37,428 --> 00:07:38,493
Did he not?

170
00:07:40,865 --> 00:07:44,099
Have I told you
how good it is to see you?

171
00:07:44,101 --> 00:07:45,367
Yes, you have.
Three times.

172
00:07:45,369 --> 00:07:46,468
Well, it is.

173
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,636
Hey, lousy circumstances.

174
00:07:47,638 --> 00:07:49,371
But, uh, hey...

175
00:07:49,373 --> 00:07:51,740
I heard from your boss that you
just, uh, got back from London.

176
00:07:51,742 --> 00:07:53,308
Were you working
a case or...?

177
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,576
No, I moved back there.

178
00:07:54,578 --> 00:07:55,677
You mean<i> moved,</i> moved?

179
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:56,845
Is there another
definition?

180
00:07:56,847 --> 00:07:58,513
I was there for
eight months,

181
00:07:58,515 --> 00:08:00,883
and had a change of heart
and returned to New York.

182
00:08:00,885 --> 00:08:02,517
So, you moved to London,
and you didn't, uh...

183
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,086
You know what?
Doesn't even matter.

184
00:08:04,088 --> 00:08:05,387
The point is you're back!

185
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:07,389
Mr. Emple.
Uh, duty calls.

186
00:08:07,391 --> 00:08:09,024
Yeah.

187
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:18,634
It's interesting.

188
00:08:18,636 --> 00:08:20,068
Mothballs are interesting?

189
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,070
They were taken from
that cabinet over there.

190
00:08:22,072 --> 00:08:25,941
Obviously, to cover the smell
of John Doe's decay.

191
00:08:25,943 --> 00:08:28,043
The killer didn't
bring them with him.

192
00:08:28,045 --> 00:08:31,179
Perhaps leaving the body here
was not part of his plan, hmm?

193
00:08:32,983 --> 00:08:36,018
Doe was shot in the foot
first and then the knee.

194
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,453
Either those were
two really bad misses or...

195
00:08:38,455 --> 00:08:41,256
Or the killer was torturing him.

196
00:08:41,258 --> 00:08:43,892
This doesn't seem like anything
you can't handle on your own.

197
00:08:43,894 --> 00:08:45,994
So you want to tell me why you
really asked me to come here?

198
00:08:45,996 --> 00:08:48,363
“This doesn't seem like anything
you can't handle on your own.”

199
00:08:48,365 --> 00:08:49,765
That's funny.

200
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:51,566
That's exactly what
I would have said

201
00:08:51,568 --> 00:08:53,602
had I been present when you
asked Kitty for her assistance

202
00:08:53,604 --> 00:08:54,937
with your tawdry side job.

203
00:08:54,939 --> 00:08:57,372
“Tawdry”?
I wanted you to know I approve.

204
00:08:57,374 --> 00:08:59,007
Of what?

205
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:01,376
Your agenda
with regards to Kitty.

206
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:03,078
Several days ago,
I gave you her file.

207
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,913
And then you show up at
the brownstone yesterday,

208
00:09:04,915 --> 00:09:06,515
and you invite her
into an investigation.

209
00:09:06,517 --> 00:09:08,183
Coincidence? No, I think not.

210
00:09:08,185 --> 00:09:11,320
You feel for her.
And now you wish to engage.

211
00:09:11,322 --> 00:09:13,956
It's not an outcome
I would have predicted, no.

212
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,458
But it is one
I approve of, yeah.

213
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,193
She could learn
a great deal from you,

214
00:09:18,195 --> 00:09:20,228
especially with regards
to how to get the most

215
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,864
from my tutelage.

216
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:25,734
So, I've already dispatched her
to, uh, follow your Mr. Keswick.

217
00:09:25,736 --> 00:09:27,836
But that's not
what I actually...

218
00:09:27,838 --> 00:09:29,404
Harlan!

219
00:09:30,741 --> 00:09:33,075
You came here to retrieve
a phone number, did you not?

220
00:09:33,077 --> 00:09:34,609
You would send a text,
and then receive

221
00:09:34,611 --> 00:09:36,845
the next clue in the game
that you were playing.

222
00:09:36,847 --> 00:09:38,747
Yeah, but I didn't find it.

223
00:09:38,749 --> 00:09:40,048
Not that I kept looking

224
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,250
after the dead guy
fell out of the locker.

225
00:09:42,252 --> 00:09:44,052
Yeah, CSU didn't find
any number either.

226
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:46,154
Probably because
it's under that paint.

227
00:09:46,156 --> 00:09:48,190
It's fresh.

228
00:09:48,192 --> 00:09:49,891
Applied in the last

229
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:52,694
24 hours.

230
00:09:52,696 --> 00:09:54,696
Right after John Doe's murder,
I'd wager.

231
00:09:54,698 --> 00:09:57,099
You don't think
this was a mob hit?

232
00:09:57,101 --> 00:09:59,101
Doe and the killer were
playing the game, too.

233
00:09:59,103 --> 00:10:01,203
The killer shot Doe and
then covered up the number

234
00:10:01,205 --> 00:10:02,704
so no one else could use it.

235
00:10:02,706 --> 00:10:04,806
What's the prize
in your little contest?

236
00:10:04,808 --> 00:10:07,576
Well, I'm doing it
mostly for the math.

237
00:10:07,578 --> 00:10:11,480
But, uh, $1,707,071.

238
00:10:11,482 --> 00:10:13,882
It's another
palindromic prime.

239
00:10:13,884 --> 00:10:17,152
Did I not mention the
money at the station?

240
00:10:17,154 --> 00:10:18,587
Who the hell can afford

241
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:20,655
that kind of payout
for a puzzle hunt?

242
00:10:20,657 --> 00:10:22,124
Well, most people
think it's CAML.

243
00:10:22,126 --> 00:10:24,593
The Center for Applied
Mathematics and Logic.

244
00:10:24,595 --> 00:10:26,094
It's located
in Ramapo...

245
00:10:26,096 --> 00:10:27,729
Wait, most people
“think” it's them?

246
00:10:27,731 --> 00:10:29,331
Well, hunts like these,

247
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,266
the organizers are
almost always anonymous.

248
00:10:31,268 --> 00:10:32,401
It's S.O.P.

249
00:10:32,403 --> 00:10:34,302
What about the
contestants?

250
00:10:34,304 --> 00:10:37,005
Is anonymity
also S.O.P.?

251
00:10:37,007 --> 00:10:39,207
For the most part, yeah.

252
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:43,078
But, guys, math peeps
are my peeps, okay?

253
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,314
It's, uh, like
a community, sort of.

254
00:10:46,316 --> 00:10:48,984
I can think of ten
or 12 other people

255
00:10:48,986 --> 00:10:50,018
who were probably competing.

256
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,186
Would that help?

257
00:10:53,157 --> 00:10:55,223
No.

258
00:10:55,225 --> 00:10:58,026
I'm sorry, I don't know him.

259
00:10:58,028 --> 00:11:00,862
But you admit you were
competing in Belphegor's Prime.

260
00:11:00,864 --> 00:11:02,197
I do.

261
00:11:04,835 --> 00:11:05,934
Pepe!

262
00:11:08,172 --> 00:11:10,439
Sorry. He doesn't
like strangers.

263
00:11:12,109 --> 00:11:14,443
Give him one of these.

264
00:11:14,445 --> 00:11:16,111
Get on his good side.

265
00:11:24,288 --> 00:11:26,354
What are you doing?

266
00:11:28,225 --> 00:11:30,725
I'm just verifying that
you've been lying to us.

267
00:11:30,727 --> 00:11:33,895
You did know the
dead man, did you not?

268
00:11:33,897 --> 00:11:36,998
I reviewed his personal
effects at the morgue earlier.

269
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,034
The coroner reported finding
crumbs in one of his pockets.

270
00:11:39,036 --> 00:11:40,036
I tasted one.

271
00:11:40,037 --> 00:11:41,269
Why would you...?

272
00:11:41,271 --> 00:11:42,771
At first, I thought
they were from

273
00:11:42,773 --> 00:11:44,439
a particularly rancid
brand of cheese,

274
00:11:44,441 --> 00:11:47,609
but, no... they're from
one of Pepe's treats.

275
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:49,277
Homemade?

276
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,481
Harlan was able to give us
the names of nine other people

277
00:11:52,483 --> 00:11:54,149
he believed to be
other competitors.

278
00:11:54,151 --> 00:11:55,984
Our colleagues are
investigating them as we speak,

279
00:11:55,986 --> 00:11:57,919
but I'll quite happily
recommend that the NYPD

280
00:11:57,921 --> 00:12:00,222
focus its attention
entirely on you.

281
00:12:04,128 --> 00:12:06,428
His name was Ike Walaczek.

282
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,231
In another lifetime,
he was my boyfriend.

283
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:10,866
And what of
this lifetime?

284
00:12:10,868 --> 00:12:12,701
We were working together.

285
00:12:12,703 --> 00:12:14,769
On Belphegor's.
What?!

286
00:12:14,771 --> 00:12:16,705
He was a numerical analyst
at the Tory Foundation.

287
00:12:16,707 --> 00:12:17,873
I work mostly in combinatorics.

288
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,307
I thought we would make
a good team.

289
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:20,742
But there aren't
supposed to be teams.

290
00:12:20,744 --> 00:12:22,711
Not in a puzzle hunt.
It's bad form.

291
00:12:22,713 --> 00:12:23,713
Harlan...

292
00:12:23,714 --> 00:12:25,514
I'm just saying...

293
00:12:25,516 --> 00:12:27,315
My husband
wouldn't understand,

294
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:30,385
so I decided I wouldn't tell him
until after we won the money.

295
00:12:30,387 --> 00:12:33,121
A team-- so that's how
you got there before me.

296
00:12:33,123 --> 00:12:34,489
I wasn't there.

297
00:12:34,491 --> 00:12:36,258
Tom and I were out of town
until this morning.

298
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,126
His cousin
was getting married in Hawaii.

299
00:12:38,128 --> 00:12:40,662
That's why Ike went
to the coordinates by himself.

300
00:12:40,664 --> 00:12:42,097
Because I couldn't.

301
00:12:44,268 --> 00:12:46,601
These are pictures I took.

302
00:12:46,603 --> 00:12:49,337
Check the dates.

303
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:51,506
You gave the police
nine other names?

304
00:12:51,508 --> 00:12:53,408
People you thought
were competing?

305
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,776
I've got 16.

306
00:12:54,778 --> 00:12:56,311
And I know they were competing.

307
00:12:58,448 --> 00:13:01,249
He talked to her
outside the Jamaica property

308
00:13:01,251 --> 00:13:05,720
for about 20 minutes,
and then this truck rolled up.

309
00:13:05,722 --> 00:13:07,822
Any idea what's
inside the crate?

310
00:13:07,824 --> 00:13:09,024
Nope.

311
00:13:09,026 --> 00:13:10,392
I can't identify
the woman either.

312
00:13:10,394 --> 00:13:12,260
Everything about her
said money though.

313
00:13:12,262 --> 00:13:15,363
She, Keswick
and the mystery box

314
00:13:15,365 --> 00:13:17,732
stayed inside the building
for about three hours,

315
00:13:17,734 --> 00:13:20,001
and then off they went.

316
00:13:20,904 --> 00:13:22,170
Good.

317
00:13:22,172 --> 00:13:23,872
Okay.

318
00:13:23,874 --> 00:13:26,074
You know where
to send the check.

319
00:13:26,076 --> 00:13:30,145
You haven't asked me about
the file Sherlock gave me.

320
00:13:30,147 --> 00:13:32,080
Why would I?

321
00:13:32,082 --> 00:13:36,184
You said it would give me
a better sense of you-- it did.

322
00:13:37,588 --> 00:13:40,155
That's why you asked
for my help.

323
00:13:40,157 --> 00:13:41,990
Because you felt sorry for me.

324
00:13:41,992 --> 00:13:44,226
No.

325
00:13:44,228 --> 00:13:46,194
You just don't seem interested
in anything

326
00:13:46,196 --> 00:13:48,063
outside of becoming
a detective.

327
00:13:48,065 --> 00:13:50,999
There she is.

328
00:13:51,001 --> 00:13:53,301
The old counselor.

329
00:13:53,303 --> 00:13:55,637
Who used to hold
Sherlock's hand.

330
00:13:57,608 --> 00:13:59,741
Everything that you read,

331
00:13:59,743 --> 00:14:02,510
everything that happened to me,
that's all it is.

332
00:14:02,512 --> 00:14:04,646
It's just something
that happened.

333
00:14:04,648 --> 00:14:08,116
And it's all
in the past now.

334
00:14:08,118 --> 00:14:10,685
So let's just
leave it there, shall we?

335
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:24,667
Hello.

336
00:14:24,668 --> 00:14:26,001
You've had sex.

337
00:14:26,003 --> 00:14:27,202
Excuse me?

338
00:14:27,204 --> 00:14:28,503
I can hear it
in your voice.

339
00:14:28,505 --> 00:14:29,771
You've joined paunches.

340
00:14:29,773 --> 00:14:30,972
Good for you, Watson.

341
00:14:30,974 --> 00:14:32,807
As you know, I think
the act of love

342
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:34,676
can be quite conducive to...
What do you want?

343
00:14:34,678 --> 00:14:36,911
Merely to apprise you
of a new development

344
00:14:36,913 --> 00:14:38,280
in the murder of
Ike Walaczek.

345
00:14:38,282 --> 00:14:40,115
As I informed
you yesterday,

346
00:14:40,117 --> 00:14:42,284
Harlan and I were given
a new list of competitors.

347
00:14:42,286 --> 00:14:45,320
One name leapt out:
Byron Lowenthal.

348
00:14:45,322 --> 00:14:48,156
He's a statistician at the
Public Utilities Commission

349
00:14:48,158 --> 00:14:50,425
and a diagnosed
paranoid schizophrenic.

350
00:14:50,427 --> 00:14:52,160
He's been hospitalized
for becoming violent

351
00:14:52,162 --> 00:14:53,728
on no fewer
than three occasions.

352
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,964
Certainly sounds like
it could be our guy.

353
00:14:55,966 --> 00:14:59,367
Unfortunately, Mr. Lowenthal had
another break earlier this year.

354
00:14:59,369 --> 00:15:02,137
He's been staying in
a transient hotel ever since.

355
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:04,239
Detective Bell and I
are going to speak with him.

356
00:15:04,241 --> 00:15:05,307
You want me to meet you?

357
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:06,875
Oh, no, we're already here.

358
00:15:06,877 --> 00:15:08,410
Anyway, now that I know
that you've enjoyed coitus

359
00:15:08,412 --> 00:15:09,778
and could enjoy more
in the near future...

360
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,846
When you're done,
we need to talk.

361
00:15:14,718 --> 00:15:16,818
Byron Lowenthal,
you in there?

362
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,053
Who is it?

363
00:15:18,055 --> 00:15:19,754
It's Detective Bell, NYPD.

364
00:15:19,756 --> 00:15:22,257
My colleague and I would like
to ask you some questions.

365
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:24,592
Let me
get some pants on.

366
00:15:37,341 --> 00:15:40,008
S-Sorry, I just... I, um...

367
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,310
I-I thought I heard
Mr. Lowenthal retr...

368
00:16:19,154 --> 00:16:21,267
You guys got lucky.

369
00:16:21,268 --> 00:16:22,868
Well, luck had little
to do with it, actually.

370
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,536
I... I heard Mr. Lowenthal

371
00:16:24,538 --> 00:16:27,039
pulling a heavy object off
a shelf, placing it on his bed,

372
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,041
and the sound of
the zipper indicated

373
00:16:29,043 --> 00:16:30,976
that it was
a large gun case.

374
00:16:30,978 --> 00:16:33,579
Looks like he was sane enough
to do math, but not much else.

375
00:16:33,581 --> 00:16:34,747
Plus, he was
pretty hopped up.

376
00:16:34,749 --> 00:16:36,448
Caffeine pills,
energy drinks,

377
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,251
pretty much every legal
stimulant you can buy.

378
00:16:39,253 --> 00:16:40,853
Plus a few illegal ones.

379
00:16:40,855 --> 00:16:42,821
Hmm. Obviously, he was
keeping himself awake

380
00:16:42,823 --> 00:16:44,490
so he could work on
Belphegor's.

381
00:16:44,492 --> 00:16:47,392
This... is obvious to you?

382
00:16:47,394 --> 00:16:48,961
I confess the maths
are beyond me,

383
00:16:48,963 --> 00:16:51,130
but I took the liberty of
sending pictures of what

384
00:16:51,132 --> 00:16:52,865
appear to be Mr. Lowenthal's
most recent scribbles

385
00:16:52,867 --> 00:16:54,166
to Harlan Emple,
and he's confirmed

386
00:16:54,168 --> 00:16:55,667
they are part of the contest.

387
00:16:55,669 --> 00:16:56,969
With your permission,
I'd like copies of these

388
00:16:56,971 --> 00:16:58,837
sent to my home
so he can review them.

389
00:16:58,839 --> 00:16:59,972
What for?

390
00:16:59,974 --> 00:17:01,073
If Byron Lowenthal

391
00:17:01,075 --> 00:17:02,441
did kill Ike Walaczek,

392
00:17:02,443 --> 00:17:04,109
then he used
and obscured a phone number,

393
00:17:04,111 --> 00:17:05,878
which would have yielded
the next problem.

394
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,379
That problem's solution

395
00:17:07,381 --> 00:17:08,714
would be GPS coordinates.

396
00:17:08,716 --> 00:17:10,415
If he's recorded them
in his books...

397
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:12,551
Your pal will be able to tell us
where he's headed next.

398
00:17:12,553 --> 00:17:14,853
I'll get our guys to give you

399
00:17:14,855 --> 00:17:16,388
whatever you need.

400
00:17:17,258 --> 00:17:18,991
Scans are still coming through,

401
00:17:18,993 --> 00:17:21,260
but I've put what we've got
so far up on the wall.

402
00:17:21,262 --> 00:17:23,262
Sherlock said that
you prefer it that way.

403
00:17:23,264 --> 00:17:25,030
Picked it up from him,
actually.

404
00:17:25,032 --> 00:17:28,600
Makes me feel like I'm really
inside of the problem.

405
00:17:30,704 --> 00:17:33,372
I'll, uh, let you know
if I need anything.

406
00:17:34,275 --> 00:17:35,974
Oh, I work without a shirt.

407
00:17:35,976 --> 00:17:38,911
Sometimes makes me feel
closer to the numbers.

408
00:17:38,913 --> 00:17:42,147
You'll need to, uh,
check the printer in the study

409
00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:43,615
for more pages.

410
00:17:43,617 --> 00:17:45,417
Uh, this is nice,
you know?

411
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:47,452
Meeting another member
of the team.

412
00:17:47,454 --> 00:17:48,654
You know, Team Sherlock.

413
00:17:48,656 --> 00:17:50,656
You help him, I help him...

414
00:17:51,926 --> 00:17:53,559
Obviously, you haven't
tackled a case

415
00:17:53,561 --> 00:17:55,093
with high-order math since
you started working with him,

416
00:17:55,095 --> 00:17:57,729
or we would've...

417
00:17:57,731 --> 00:17:59,031
What?

418
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:00,232
What?

419
00:18:00,234 --> 00:18:01,834
Wait...

420
00:18:01,836 --> 00:18:04,002
have you worked a case
with high-order math?

421
00:18:04,805 --> 00:18:06,238
You have, haven't you?

422
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,840
Does it matter?

423
00:18:07,842 --> 00:18:09,842
Of course it...

424
00:18:09,844 --> 00:18:11,443
Oh, my God.

425
00:18:11,445 --> 00:18:13,278
Did he fire me?

426
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,980
All I know
is that back in London,

427
00:18:14,982 --> 00:18:16,982
we worked a case that involved
Fibonacci spirals...

428
00:18:16,984 --> 00:18:18,483
He fired me.

429
00:18:18,485 --> 00:18:21,386
...and he called some woman
named Indira Patel.

430
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,856
She's at Berkeley.

431
00:18:23,858 --> 00:18:25,624
I'm three time zones closer!

432
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:27,125
You're here now.

433
00:18:27,127 --> 00:18:29,428
Sure, because I found
a dead body.

434
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,531
I have to go; I have to run
some errands for Sherlock.

435
00:18:35,936 --> 00:18:37,903
I-I don't know
what was in the crate,

436
00:18:37,905 --> 00:18:39,271
but the stenciling on
the side indicates

437
00:18:39,273 --> 00:18:40,772
it came from one of
the SUNY schools.

438
00:18:40,774 --> 00:18:42,908
I put another detective
on Keswick...

439
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:45,177
Don't kill me, I had to
use your razor to shave.

440
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:47,179
I...

441
00:18:47,181 --> 00:18:49,147
You must be Andrew.

442
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:50,515
Sherlock Holmes.

443
00:18:50,517 --> 00:18:52,551
Sorry.

444
00:18:52,553 --> 00:18:55,487
Joan said you were coming;
I... I forgot.

445
00:18:55,489 --> 00:18:57,122
It's not how
I wanted to meet you.

446
00:18:57,124 --> 00:18:58,891
She said you can tell
a lot about people

447
00:18:58,893 --> 00:19:00,192
just by looking at them.

448
00:19:00,194 --> 00:19:02,261
I swear, I...
usually wear pants.

449
00:19:02,263 --> 00:19:03,729
Well, in my experience,
most people

450
00:19:03,731 --> 00:19:05,264
need only be concerned
I won't notice

451
00:19:05,266 --> 00:19:06,498
anything worth remarking upon.

452
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:10,535
Watson seems adequately sexed.

453
00:19:11,939 --> 00:19:13,672
Hey.

454
00:19:13,674 --> 00:19:15,674
I was just introducing myself.

455
00:19:17,945 --> 00:19:20,379
I've got that thing.
I'll see you tonight.

456
00:19:20,381 --> 00:19:21,580
Okay.

457
00:19:27,855 --> 00:19:30,188
Your home, Watson...

458
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,823
it's utterly pleasant.

459
00:19:31,825 --> 00:19:33,692
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

460
00:19:33,694 --> 00:19:35,394
When you told me
you wanted a life of your own,

461
00:19:35,396 --> 00:19:36,595
I didn't realize
that you meant you wanted

462
00:19:36,597 --> 00:19:38,030
the same life everyone else has.

463
00:19:38,032 --> 00:19:39,464
But at any rate,
none of my business, is it?

464
00:19:39,466 --> 00:19:41,233
It's not.
And I didn't ask you here

465
00:19:41,235 --> 00:19:42,634
to talk about my apartment.

466
00:19:42,636 --> 00:19:44,970
No, you asked me here
to discuss Kitty.

467
00:19:44,972 --> 00:19:46,471
If she were not
the topic of conversation,

468
00:19:46,473 --> 00:19:48,941
then you wouldn't have
invited me to your home,

469
00:19:48,943 --> 00:19:50,776
where there's no chance
she'll be present.

470
00:19:52,346 --> 00:19:53,946
She disappointed you
in some way.

471
00:19:53,948 --> 00:19:55,247
Skills not up to snuff?

472
00:19:55,249 --> 00:19:57,316
Please remember
she is a novice.

473
00:19:57,318 --> 00:19:58,850
Actually, she did a great job.

474
00:19:58,852 --> 00:20:00,285
But I have some concerns.

475
00:20:00,287 --> 00:20:01,954
I thought we could
talk about them.

476
00:20:03,757 --> 00:20:04,923
You think that
Kitty needs help

477
00:20:04,925 --> 00:20:06,091
above and beyond
my mentorship.

478
00:20:06,093 --> 00:20:07,392
You read the same
file I did.

479
00:20:07,394 --> 00:20:08,894
She's a rape victim.

480
00:20:08,896 --> 00:20:11,296
She was kept and tortured.

481
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,899
Mm.

482
00:20:16,136 --> 00:20:19,171
You know me, so surely you know

483
00:20:19,173 --> 00:20:22,874
I've broached the subject of
a support group meeting before.

484
00:20:22,876 --> 00:20:25,010
Even offered
to pay for therapy.

485
00:20:25,012 --> 00:20:26,812
She's not interested, I know.

486
00:20:26,814 --> 00:20:28,447
Just as you also know

487
00:20:28,449 --> 00:20:30,749
someone with a problem
can't be forced to get help.

488
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:32,551
They have to want it.

489
00:20:32,553 --> 00:20:34,786
What Kitty wants
is to be a detective.

490
00:20:36,523 --> 00:20:38,490
I am taking pains
to try and channel

491
00:20:38,492 --> 00:20:40,592
her residual feelings
into her work.

492
00:20:42,329 --> 00:20:44,463
Well, that works out
great for you.

493
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:48,400
You told me that
you took on a partner

494
00:20:48,402 --> 00:20:50,635
because you wanted to replicate
what you and I had.

495
00:20:50,637 --> 00:20:52,637
That you thought it helped
with your recovery.

496
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:54,539
You think I would
try and take advantage

497
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,208
of the victim of a trauma?

498
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,910
Of course not, but there is
a conflict of interest here.

499
00:20:58,912 --> 00:21:02,447
She needs what she needs,
but you need what you need, too.

500
00:21:06,053 --> 00:21:10,055
It's-it's good that you're
in her life now, Watson.

501
00:21:10,057 --> 00:21:12,524
I mean,
it's commonly believed that, um,

502
00:21:12,526 --> 00:21:16,228
a child benefits mostly from
the presence of two parents.

503
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,164
He-- or she, in this case--
can absorb certain qualities

504
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,466
from the father--
clear-eyed view of the world,

505
00:21:21,468 --> 00:21:23,168
capacity of
rational thought, etcetera.

506
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,170
They can also absorb certain
qualities from the mother.

507
00:21:25,172 --> 00:21:27,105
Excuse me, but I am not
Kitty's mother,

508
00:21:27,107 --> 00:21:28,807
and she sure as hell
is not our child.

509
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:30,942
You brought her here;
she looks up to you.

510
00:21:30,944 --> 00:21:32,944
She says that she doesn't
need help-- fine--

511
00:21:32,946 --> 00:21:34,579
but you know better.

512
00:21:34,581 --> 00:21:37,082
And you're gonna have to be
the one that tells her.

513
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,620
It's Harlan.

514
00:21:41,622 --> 00:21:44,523
Making progress with the maths.

515
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,660
We thought
that Byron and Ike

516
00:21:48,662 --> 00:21:50,462
arrived at Portal Ten
simultaneously.

517
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,664
That would've meant that they
were doing all the same math

518
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,032
at essentially
the same time.

519
00:21:54,034 --> 00:21:56,001
Only, the math
you found at Byron's place

520
00:21:56,003 --> 00:21:57,003
says that's wrong.

521
00:21:57,004 --> 00:21:58,470
He was one step behind Ike.

522
00:21:58,472 --> 00:22:00,705
Are you proposing he did
not kill Mr. Walaczek?

523
00:22:00,707 --> 00:22:03,175
I don't know, but that's
not the weirdest part.

524
00:22:03,177 --> 00:22:04,810
Byron was obsessive.

525
00:22:04,812 --> 00:22:06,211
He time-stamped
almost everything he did.

526
00:22:06,213 --> 00:22:09,047
He only solved
the Portal Nine problem,

527
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:11,316
the same problem that sent me
to that old factory last night.

528
00:22:11,318 --> 00:22:12,884
But get this--

529
00:22:12,886 --> 00:22:14,686
he wasn't given
the same problem as me.

530
00:22:14,688 --> 00:22:16,655
And so it would've yielded
GPS coordinates

531
00:22:16,657 --> 00:22:18,323
for an entirely
different location.

532
00:22:18,325 --> 00:22:21,760
The person in charge of
the game changed the clue

533
00:22:21,762 --> 00:22:23,328
after the police
found Ike's body.

534
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:25,964
Well, he had to, right?

535
00:22:25,966 --> 00:22:27,899
If he hadn't, he would be
sending other competitors

536
00:22:27,901 --> 00:22:29,101
to an active crime scene.

537
00:22:29,103 --> 00:22:30,402
The important thing is

538
00:22:30,404 --> 00:22:31,536
I figured out the coordinates

539
00:22:31,538 --> 00:22:32,771
to the second location.

540
00:22:32,773 --> 00:22:35,540
I know where Byron went.

541
00:22:35,542 --> 00:22:36,842
What are you doing?

542
00:22:36,844 --> 00:22:38,410
You're saying he
time-stamped everything.

543
00:22:38,412 --> 00:22:40,345
I'm looking at the time
he received his clues.

544
00:22:40,347 --> 00:22:42,647
It's all there, to the second,
but what does that have to do...

545
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:44,149
What if you hadn't
found a body?

546
00:22:44,151 --> 00:22:46,118
If the game had
proceeded as planned,

547
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,486
what were you meant
to do there?

548
00:22:47,488 --> 00:22:49,354
I would have sent a text
to the phone number,

549
00:22:49,356 --> 00:22:51,523
the one that the killer painted
over, and then I would have

550
00:22:51,525 --> 00:22:52,891
gotten a message back
with the next problem.

551
00:22:52,893 --> 00:22:54,559
There's an extra
step in there.

552
00:22:54,561 --> 00:22:56,428
Why all this rigmarole with
phone numbers and texts?

553
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,064
Why not just post the problem
itself at the factory?

554
00:22:59,066 --> 00:23:02,100
I don't know, it's just the way
the game is played.

555
00:23:02,102 --> 00:23:04,102
They're for an old
industrial area in Queens.

556
00:23:04,104 --> 00:23:06,805
You're welcome
for finding your suspect.

557
00:23:06,807 --> 00:23:09,207
If I'm right, Harlan,
what you've found...

558
00:23:09,209 --> 00:23:11,109
is the site of
another murder.

559
00:23:11,111 --> 00:23:13,245
Byron Lowenthal's.

560
00:23:15,983 --> 00:23:18,216
You were right,
Lowenthal's dead.

561
00:23:18,218 --> 00:23:20,952
He was shot in the foot,
then the knee.

562
00:23:20,954 --> 00:23:22,821
Just like
Ike Wallaczek.

563
00:23:22,823 --> 00:23:26,391
I'm, uh, gonna look
over here now.

564
00:23:26,393 --> 00:23:29,427
Well, we think the perp
was pulling the body

565
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:31,429
to a car that was parked
over there.

566
00:23:31,431 --> 00:23:34,065
Then he just
left him here.

567
00:23:34,067 --> 00:23:35,901
Probably afraid
he'd been spotted.

568
00:23:35,903 --> 00:23:38,803
There's a lot
of homeless in the area.

569
00:23:41,441 --> 00:23:43,008
Question is:

570
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:45,010
how'd you know
Lowenthal was the next victim

571
00:23:45,012 --> 00:23:46,511
and not the killer?

572
00:23:49,316 --> 00:23:51,750
Well, that's
quite simple, really.

573
00:23:51,752 --> 00:23:54,352
The game is directing
its players to remote locales,

574
00:23:54,354 --> 00:23:56,788
and then instructing them
to send a text message

575
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,256
indicating their presence.

576
00:23:58,258 --> 00:24:00,125
I suspect the killer wanted
to remove the body

577
00:24:00,127 --> 00:24:02,928
so he could keep this new
location “in play,” so to speak.

578
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:05,130
Still missing the “simple” part.

579
00:24:05,132 --> 00:24:06,698
The late Mr. Lowenthal

580
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,366
received his final clue

581
00:24:08,368 --> 00:24:10,235
after Harlan discovered
Ike Wallaczek's body,

582
00:24:10,237 --> 00:24:12,737
but before news of the killing
had reached the media.

583
00:24:12,739 --> 00:24:14,439
That means the
game's designer

584
00:24:14,441 --> 00:24:16,408
knew the location
had been compromised.

585
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,577
And the only way
that he could have known that,

586
00:24:18,579 --> 00:24:20,111
at the time that he knew it,

587
00:24:20,113 --> 00:24:21,880
was if he, himself,
was the killer.

588
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,917
Belphegor's Prime is not
a treasure hunt.

589
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,619
It's a trap.

590
00:24:40,696 --> 00:24:42,196
Better?

591
00:24:42,198 --> 00:24:44,665
False alarm.

592
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:47,668
But I still feel
a little queasy.

593
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,273
This new dead guy--

594
00:24:52,275 --> 00:24:54,875
your friend said that he was
tortured, too, right?

595
00:24:54,877 --> 00:24:57,244
Right before the killer tried
to abscond with his corpse.

596
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:59,213
I assume
he intended to take

597
00:24:59,215 --> 00:25:02,383
Ike Wallaczek away with him
as well, only Ike was too large.

598
00:25:02,385 --> 00:25:04,685
A speedy mothballing
was the best he could do.

599
00:25:04,687 --> 00:25:07,221
So, just to recap,

600
00:25:07,223 --> 00:25:09,657
I've spent the last
few months of my life

601
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:13,360
playing a game that was
designed to kill me.

602
00:25:13,362 --> 00:25:15,629
Got to be a metaphor
in there somewhere, right?

603
00:25:15,631 --> 00:25:18,966
I think the word you're
looking for is “moral.”

604
00:25:18,968 --> 00:25:21,902
There is a moral in there:
games are for idiots.

605
00:25:24,707 --> 00:25:26,473
Breaking news from Ramapo.

606
00:25:26,475 --> 00:25:29,443
Kitty reports the Center for
Applied Mathematics and Logic

607
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,912
is not the sponsor
of Belphegor's Prime.

608
00:25:31,914 --> 00:25:34,148
Then it's got to be
a serial killer, right?

609
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,716
Someone who's obsessed
with mathematicians?

610
00:25:35,718 --> 00:25:37,284
Mm.

611
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,920
Perhaps he was bullied
by mathematicians as a child.

612
00:25:39,922 --> 00:25:42,056
Or mathematicians
killed his parents.

613
00:25:42,058 --> 00:25:43,657
I'm being serious.

614
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:45,726
Serial killers who devise
elaborate death traps

615
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,461
are the stuff of pulp fiction.

616
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:49,229
And besides, with respect
to these murders,

617
00:25:49,231 --> 00:25:51,165
there are none
of the elaborations

618
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:53,767
which mark that sort of culprit.

619
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:55,970
If anything, I would describe
the work as businesslike.

620
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:58,172
Then it's the government.

621
00:25:58,174 --> 00:26:01,241
I mean, the-the game was some
sort of test to weed out people

622
00:26:01,243 --> 00:26:03,243
who could weaponize math.

623
00:26:03,245 --> 00:26:05,179
The American intelligence
apparatus may be clod-like,

624
00:26:05,181 --> 00:26:07,014
but I think they would
do a better job

625
00:26:07,016 --> 00:26:08,749
of disposing of two bodies,
don't you?

626
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:11,785
Watson?

627
00:26:11,787 --> 00:26:13,621
I just heard
from one of the suspects

628
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:14,922
Marcus and I talked to
yesterday,

629
00:26:14,924 --> 00:26:16,290
another puzzle-hunter.

630
00:26:16,292 --> 00:26:18,525
Tell me he confessed
to the murders.

631
00:26:18,527 --> 00:26:20,427
We ruled him out right away,
but he heard about

632
00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:22,329
Byron Lowenthal's murder on
the news and wanted me to know

633
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:25,165
he's at a friend's place,
some guy named Paul.

634
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,934
That is fascinating.

635
00:26:26,936 --> 00:26:28,369
Actually, it might be.

636
00:26:28,371 --> 00:26:31,038
Paul is positive he knows
who the killer is.

637
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,807
I know the guards
are a bit much,

638
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:35,509
but I wanted everyone
to feel safe.

639
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:38,178
And, besides,
math has been good to me.

640
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,279
Commodities.

641
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:40,848
So, you and your friends,

642
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:43,150
you were competitors
in Belphegor's Prime?

643
00:26:43,152 --> 00:26:45,352
Most of us. Some of the others
are just here for the math.

644
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,121
You said you could
identify the killer.

645
00:26:47,123 --> 00:26:49,323
I can, sort of.

646
00:26:52,061 --> 00:26:54,194
“Mo Shellshocker.”

647
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:56,930
It's a pseudonym,
obviously, but I'm telling you,

648
00:26:56,932 --> 00:26:58,365
this is the guy
you're looking for.

649
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,600
I've heard of him.

650
00:26:59,602 --> 00:27:01,335
He uses his blog
to expose bad math.

651
00:27:01,337 --> 00:27:03,837
Corrupt economists, biased
pollsters, that sort of thing.

652
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:05,572
He's actually
sort of a crusader.

653
00:27:05,574 --> 00:27:06,574
He's a murderer.

654
00:27:06,575 --> 00:27:09,143
How can you be
so sure?

655
00:27:09,145 --> 00:27:10,744
When he isn't crusading,
he's competing in puzzle hunts.

656
00:27:10,746 --> 00:27:11,812
A few months ago,

657
00:27:11,814 --> 00:27:13,080
he claimed to
have solved

658
00:27:13,082 --> 00:27:14,815
Cicada 3301 two
years in a row.

659
00:27:14,817 --> 00:27:17,484
Some people called BS,
including...

660
00:27:17,486 --> 00:27:20,120
Ike Wallaczek
and Byron Lowenthal.

661
00:27:20,122 --> 00:27:21,221
“WallaCheckYourMath,”

662
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:22,489
“ByLow2020.”

663
00:27:22,491 --> 00:27:23,757
Those are their
online handles.

664
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:25,392
Their friends
will confirm it.

665
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,528
A flame war does not
a murderer make.

666
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:30,097
The stuff these guys were
slinging at each other was ugly.

667
00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:32,099
Mo knew they were into hunts,
and so he built one

668
00:27:32,101 --> 00:27:34,034
that would send them to places
where he could kill them.

669
00:27:34,036 --> 00:27:35,469
That's what we're
doing here is

670
00:27:35,471 --> 00:27:36,837
we're just sifting
through all the math

671
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:38,338
he's posted on his blog
over the years,

672
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,840
to see if we could
find his signature

673
00:27:39,842 --> 00:27:41,975
or something that
could identify him.

674
00:27:41,977 --> 00:27:45,279
If two people weren't dead,
we'd probably be having fun.

675
00:27:45,281 --> 00:27:46,747
But still, the
chances that he left

676
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:48,582
something like that
in his math...

677
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,784
If it's there, we'll find it.
In the meantime,

678
00:27:50,786 --> 00:27:52,186
we thought the
police should know

679
00:27:52,188 --> 00:27:53,687
who they're really
dealing with.

680
00:27:53,689 --> 00:27:55,389
<i>I've got to go meet someone</i>

681
00:27:55,391 --> 00:27:56,924
about my other case.

682
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:59,927
You're good to pass all this
along to Marcus? Okay.

683
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:03,030
I must say, I'm surprised you
didn't offer to stay and help.

684
00:28:03,032 --> 00:28:05,265
Mr. Ettinger makes
a compelling case with respect

685
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,067
to Mo Shellshocker's
viability as a suspect.

686
00:28:07,069 --> 00:28:09,002
Mo is a genius.

687
00:28:09,004 --> 00:28:10,637
We're talking off the charts.

688
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:12,139
Leibniz meets Euler meets Gauss.

689
00:28:12,141 --> 00:28:14,108
Huh.
He may have an ego,

690
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,110
but he's not gonna kill
anyone over a few comments.

691
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:18,312
So, while “The League of
Concerned Mathematician”"

692
00:28:18,314 --> 00:28:21,014
chases its tail up there, I
am gonna do the smart thing

693
00:28:21,016 --> 00:28:22,416
and get out of town.

694
00:28:22,418 --> 00:28:24,485
You can let me know
when it all blows over.

695
00:28:24,487 --> 00:28:26,386
You're not going
anywhere, Harlan.

696
00:28:26,388 --> 00:28:29,223
Or should I call you
Mo Shellshocker?

697
00:28:32,728 --> 00:28:34,661
Did you honestly think
I wouldn't recognize

698
00:28:34,663 --> 00:28:36,130
an anagram of my own name?

699
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:40,567
I knew I should've gone
with “Choker Hell Moss”"

700
00:28:40,569 --> 00:28:42,569
But I never thought
that you would see it, okay?

701
00:28:42,571 --> 00:28:44,104
Math is my thing, not yours.

702
00:28:44,106 --> 00:28:46,473
It's my name, Harlan;
that makes it my thing.

703
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,675
It was an homage.

704
00:28:48,677 --> 00:28:50,043
Explain.

705
00:28:50,045 --> 00:28:52,045
Every day, all over the world,

706
00:28:52,047 --> 00:28:54,348
math is used to trick people.

707
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,917
Data dredging to sell
pharmaceuticals.

708
00:28:56,919 --> 00:28:59,720
Publication bias
to justify wars.

709
00:28:59,722 --> 00:29:02,322
In the wrong hands, math can be
manipulated, abused.

710
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:05,425
And I decided to do
something about it.

711
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:09,596
You catch people
who murder other people.

712
00:29:09,598 --> 00:29:11,431
I catch people who murder math.

713
00:29:11,433 --> 00:29:14,568
According to this,
Mo is a wanted man.

714
00:29:17,606 --> 00:29:19,940
Harlan?

715
00:29:19,942 --> 00:29:23,110
The D.O.D. was working
on a new fighter.

716
00:29:23,112 --> 00:29:27,047
Only, I knew that the
performance stats were bogus.

717
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:29,116
A friend of mine found
the internal numbers,

718
00:29:29,118 --> 00:29:31,251
and I sort of published them.

719
00:29:31,253 --> 00:29:33,320
So you put classified
Department of Defense documents

720
00:29:33,322 --> 00:29:34,888
on the Internet.

721
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:36,623
Isn't that what
you would have done?

722
00:29:38,928 --> 00:29:41,562
Fine! I screwed up, okay?

723
00:29:41,564 --> 00:29:43,730
But, hey, that's what I do,
right? I screw up.

724
00:29:43,732 --> 00:29:46,233
If I didn't, then probably you
wouldn't have secretly fired me.

725
00:29:46,235 --> 00:29:47,968
Excuse me?

726
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,403
I know about Indira Patel!

727
00:29:51,006 --> 00:29:53,340
I know you replaced me.

728
00:29:55,144 --> 00:29:58,979
Kitty, I think
we could use some tea.

729
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:04,318
Just tell me.

730
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,253
Tell me what math I got wrong.

731
00:30:06,255 --> 00:30:09,356
Tell me why you didn't let me
make it up to you.

732
00:30:09,358 --> 00:30:12,926
It wasn't the maths, it was you.

733
00:30:14,763 --> 00:30:18,232
Your work was impeccable.

734
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:20,334
And for the most part,
I enjoyed our collaborations.

735
00:30:20,336 --> 00:30:24,838
B-But over time, you just...
you became quite... needy.

736
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,406
What are you talking about?

737
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:29,109
Y-You asked my advice
on-on social matters,

738
00:30:29,111 --> 00:30:32,512
and you even invited me
to a party.

739
00:30:32,514 --> 00:30:34,648
You were my friend.

740
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,416
I was your employer, Harlan.

741
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:37,918
A-And you were my consultant.

742
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,419
One of many.

743
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:43,757
I know that I'm a little
obsessed with what I do.

744
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:46,960
That has always made it hard
to make friends.

745
00:30:46,962 --> 00:30:50,664
And I used to feel pretty bad
about that, and then I met you.

746
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:52,566
And I thought to myself,

747
00:30:52,568 --> 00:30:55,903
hey, if it doesn't bother him,
why should I let it bother me?

748
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:03,810
I got a lot
out of the work that we did.

749
00:31:03,812 --> 00:31:06,146
A lot.

750
00:31:06,148 --> 00:31:11,218
But if someone like you thinks
that I'm a loser, then...

751
00:31:22,564 --> 00:31:24,965
Hey, are we still doing this?

752
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:26,366
Doing what?

753
00:31:26,368 --> 00:31:28,502
Talking about the case.

754
00:31:28,504 --> 00:31:30,070
You're just sitting there.

755
00:31:30,072 --> 00:31:32,105
I'm thinking.

756
00:31:32,107 --> 00:31:34,308
I suspect the silence
is exacerbated

757
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,143
by the nature
of our communication.

758
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:37,811
Yes. Well, I don't
live there anymore.

759
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,713
So, if you want
to talk shop at night,

760
00:31:39,715 --> 00:31:41,515
this is the best I can do.

761
00:31:41,517 --> 00:31:45,252
Keep asking myself:
what did the killer want?

762
00:31:45,254 --> 00:31:48,255
He went to great lengths to lure
brilliant mathematicians

763
00:31:48,257 --> 00:31:49,489
to their deaths.

764
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,525
Winnowed out
the less gifted

765
00:31:51,527 --> 00:31:54,061
by making his problems
more and more complicated.

766
00:31:54,063 --> 00:31:57,597
He had a type, but I still think
he's a serial killer

767
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:59,266
only in the most
technical sense.

768
00:31:59,268 --> 00:32:01,201
He tortured both his victims.

769
00:32:01,203 --> 00:32:02,936
But there's no sign
that he enjoyed it.

770
00:32:02,938 --> 00:32:04,538
The work was
utilitarian,

771
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,740
suggesting it was
less for pleasure

772
00:32:06,742 --> 00:32:10,043
and more for persuasion.

773
00:32:10,045 --> 00:32:11,945
He wanted something.

774
00:32:11,947 --> 00:32:13,714
But what?

775
00:32:13,716 --> 00:32:16,483
Maybe there's a connection
between Wallaczek and Lowenthal

776
00:32:16,485 --> 00:32:18,418
we haven't spotted yet.

777
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,220
Maybe they were working
on a project together,

778
00:32:20,222 --> 00:32:21,822
something that was worth
a lot of money.

779
00:32:21,824 --> 00:32:23,857
There's no way the killer
could have predicted

780
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:26,093
which competitors would make it
to the terminal stage.

781
00:32:26,095 --> 00:32:28,795
That part of the game
was beyond his control.

782
00:32:28,797 --> 00:32:30,664
If it weren't,
he would've been prepared

783
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:33,300
to dispose of a body
the size of Ike Wallaczek's.

784
00:32:33,302 --> 00:32:35,335
So, even if there were a
connection between the victims,

785
00:32:35,337 --> 00:32:37,070
the killer could not
have counted on them

786
00:32:37,072 --> 00:32:38,839
being lured into his trap.

787
00:32:38,841 --> 00:32:41,041
Certainly not
in sequence.

788
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:45,112
His game was, in many respects,
one of chance.

789
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:51,718
Suggesting he knows what
he wants, but not who has it.

790
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,888
Like he was on a puzzle hunt
of his own.

791
00:32:56,825 --> 00:32:58,859
I'm back.

792
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:05,665
I'll set up
downstairs, yeah?

793
00:33:09,138 --> 00:33:11,238
I've been thinking about
what you said earlier.

794
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,740
I've decided to engage her
one more time

795
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:15,609
with regards
to her recuperation.

796
00:33:17,112 --> 00:33:21,815
I doubt she'll listen,
but I'll keep you apprised.

797
00:33:25,954 --> 00:33:27,421
I've been thinking.

798
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:29,623
About?
You. Your history.

799
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:31,825
Your decision
not to seek help.

800
00:33:31,827 --> 00:33:34,594
I think it's
a mistake.

801
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,530
Oh?

802
00:33:36,532 --> 00:33:38,198
I've looked into a number
of support groups.

803
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,633
As you are well aware,

804
00:33:39,635 --> 00:33:41,701
I have benefited greatly
from similar settings.

805
00:33:41,703 --> 00:33:43,270
You have.

806
00:33:43,272 --> 00:33:44,638
The process, I find,

807
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,906
is not unlike
voiding one's bowels...

808
00:33:45,908 --> 00:33:47,808
I'll go.
What?

809
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:49,676
I'll go.
Just get me the details.

810
00:33:52,014 --> 00:33:55,182
I've been thinking, too-- about
your number-cruncher, Harlan.

811
00:33:55,184 --> 00:33:57,017
You think I was
too hard on him.

812
00:33:57,019 --> 00:33:58,685
You will have consultants
of your own one day.

813
00:33:58,687 --> 00:34:01,488
You'll see that they require
management and focus.

814
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:04,124
They are but keys on a keyboard,
and we're the typists.

815
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:06,159
You could've given him
a shoeing for all I care.

816
00:34:06,161 --> 00:34:07,828
No, I'm just saying that

817
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:10,030
some of the stuff he's got
up to, it's quite good.

818
00:34:10,032 --> 00:34:11,698
You should take a look.

819
00:34:13,368 --> 00:34:15,735
You may find a fellow typist.

820
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,076
Hello?

821
00:34:23,078 --> 00:34:25,312
Yeah, I
hear that you and some friends

822
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:27,848
are trying to identify
Mo Shellshocker.

823
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,649
That's right. Who is this?

824
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:32,719
His name is Harlan Emple.

825
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:34,020
You got a pen?

826
00:34:34,022 --> 00:34:36,456
I'll-I'll give you his address.

827
00:34:52,454 --> 00:34:54,020
Harlan.

828
00:34:54,022 --> 00:34:56,356
You can't take a hint, can you?

829
00:34:56,358 --> 00:34:57,657
I got your text messages.

830
00:34:57,659 --> 00:34:58,958
I don't want to see you
right now.

831
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,827
So if you came here
to apologize...

832
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:03,363
Actually, I came here
to spare you an agonizing death.

833
00:35:04,299 --> 00:35:05,832
Can I come in?

834
00:35:05,834 --> 00:35:08,301
I was puzzling earlier

835
00:35:08,303 --> 00:35:12,038
as to why the killer went
to such specific lengths.

836
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,606
What did he want?

837
00:35:13,608 --> 00:35:15,809
And then Watson,
quite by accident,

838
00:35:15,811 --> 00:35:17,410
she made a most
compelling analogy.

839
00:35:17,412 --> 00:35:20,080
She said it was as if he
was on a hunt of his own.

840
00:35:20,082 --> 00:35:22,615
Duh. He was hunting
mathematicians.

841
00:35:22,617 --> 00:35:23,783
No, he wasn't.

842
00:35:23,785 --> 00:35:25,151
He was hunting<i> a</i> mathematician.

843
00:35:25,153 --> 00:35:26,619
One.

844
00:35:26,621 --> 00:35:29,389
A man who had concealed
his identity not only

845
00:35:29,391 --> 00:35:31,191
from the mathematics
community at large,

846
00:35:31,193 --> 00:35:32,859
but also from the FBI.

847
00:35:32,861 --> 00:35:35,395
A “crusader,”
you might call him.

848
00:35:35,397 --> 00:35:36,763
Wait a minute.

849
00:35:36,765 --> 00:35:38,731
Are you saying that
this was all about me?

850
00:35:53,448 --> 00:35:56,449
<i> Unfortunately, emulating</i>
<i>the work of people like me</i>

851
00:35:56,451 --> 00:35:59,018
<i>is not without risks.</i>

852
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,320
Creates enemies.

853
00:36:00,322 --> 00:36:02,889
I knew it was the government.

854
00:36:02,891 --> 00:36:04,424
It was a lottery winner.

855
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,260
Little over a year ago,

856
00:36:07,262 --> 00:36:09,529
you started a series of blogs
where you exposed the flaws

857
00:36:09,531 --> 00:36:11,664
in certain scratch card
lottery games.

858
00:36:11,666 --> 00:36:13,766
Tickets like this one.

859
00:36:13,768 --> 00:36:15,802
I wrote about
baited hook games.

860
00:36:15,804 --> 00:36:17,971
Games where the numbers
are printed on the front.

861
00:36:17,973 --> 00:36:20,707
Scratch off the hidden numbers,
hope for a match.

862
00:36:20,709 --> 00:36:23,309
Only, you proved that with
careful mathematical analysis

863
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:25,512
of the visible numbers,
you could predict

864
00:36:25,514 --> 00:36:28,381
which tickets were winners
80% of the time.

865
00:36:28,383 --> 00:36:29,682
If you had exploited

866
00:36:29,684 --> 00:36:32,085
this flaw,
rather than exposing it,

867
00:36:32,087 --> 00:36:33,520
you could have made millions.

868
00:36:33,522 --> 00:36:36,022
Well... sure.
But that would been cheating.

869
00:36:36,024 --> 00:36:37,157
Right.

870
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:38,825
So imagine
for a moment

871
00:36:38,827 --> 00:36:41,060
that you are a less
honest mathematician.

872
00:36:41,062 --> 00:36:42,495
Right?

873
00:36:42,497 --> 00:36:44,063
You've been taking
advantage of these games

874
00:36:44,065 --> 00:36:47,967
for a couple of years to
amass a small fortune.

875
00:36:47,969 --> 00:36:49,502
And then “Mo"
comes along.

876
00:36:49,504 --> 00:36:51,971
He starts exposing
the broken games.

877
00:36:51,973 --> 00:36:54,340
State lottery commissions
shut them down.

878
00:36:54,342 --> 00:36:56,976
The exploitable
games dry up.

879
00:36:56,978 --> 00:37:00,613
Now, if you were a
psychopathic lottery cheat,

880
00:37:00,615 --> 00:37:02,582
how do you fix that?

881
00:37:02,584 --> 00:37:04,484
You kill Mo.

882
00:37:04,486 --> 00:37:07,253
<i>Unfortunately, Mo is elusive.</i>

883
00:37:07,255 --> 00:37:08,821
<i>Anonymous.</i>

884
00:37:08,823 --> 00:37:11,224
The only thing
he knew about him for sure

885
00:37:11,226 --> 00:37:14,394
was that he could not resist
a puzzle hunt.

886
00:37:14,396 --> 00:37:17,130
Now, if you were smart enough
to identify

887
00:37:17,132 --> 00:37:19,399
and take advantage of
broken lottery games...

888
00:37:19,401 --> 00:37:21,868
Then I'm smart enough
to design a puzzle hunt.

889
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:25,338
This plan was not
without its flaws.

890
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:28,775
Once a competitor
reached the terminal stage,

891
00:37:28,777 --> 00:37:32,745
the killer could not be certain
that he'd trapped Mo, could he?

892
00:37:32,747 --> 00:37:34,480
So he tortured them.

893
00:37:34,482 --> 00:37:37,083
I submit he forced them to
log on to Mo's Web site,

894
00:37:37,085 --> 00:37:39,686
and when they failed...

895
00:37:41,323 --> 00:37:42,755
After two murders,

896
00:37:42,757 --> 00:37:44,290
the game was compromised.

897
00:37:44,292 --> 00:37:46,192
So the killer devises
a Plan “B.”

898
00:37:46,194 --> 00:37:47,460
He tricks

899
00:37:47,462 --> 00:37:49,229
a group of his peers

900
00:37:49,231 --> 00:37:51,097
into helping search
for an alternative means

901
00:37:51,099 --> 00:37:53,032
of identifying Mo.

902
00:37:56,504 --> 00:37:58,438
You're talking about that guy.

903
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,906
The one with the penthouse.

904
00:37:59,908 --> 00:38:02,742
<i>Paul?</i>

905
00:38:02,744 --> 00:38:05,044
Lottery winners
are public record.

906
00:38:05,046 --> 00:38:07,814
So when I searched for
the names of repeat winners

907
00:38:07,816 --> 00:38:09,482
in the dates prior
to your posts...

908
00:38:09,484 --> 00:38:11,317
I can't believe
I drank his water.

909
00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:12,685
I called him.

910
00:38:12,687 --> 00:38:14,654
I identified you as Mo.

911
00:38:14,656 --> 00:38:16,122
And I gave him your address.

912
00:38:16,124 --> 00:38:17,590
You what?!

913
00:38:21,129 --> 00:38:23,062
Drop your weapon!

914
00:38:23,064 --> 00:38:24,597
<i>I did not, however, give him</i>

915
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:25,965
<i>the correct apartment number.</i>

916
00:38:25,967 --> 00:38:28,334
He was arrested
a little over an hour ago.

917
00:38:30,739 --> 00:38:31,871
Tried to call you to
tell you, but, um...

918
00:38:31,873 --> 00:38:33,539
But I was ignoring you.

919
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:35,008
Yes, you were ignoring me.

920
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,209
Look, you know

921
00:38:36,211 --> 00:38:37,377
that I'm still screwed, right?

922
00:38:37,379 --> 00:38:39,279
You told him that I'm Mo.

923
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:42,115
He's gonna tell the police,
they're gonna tell the FBI...

924
00:38:42,117 --> 00:38:43,516
The NYPD is under
the impression

925
00:38:43,518 --> 00:38:45,385
that I lied about
your connection to Mo

926
00:38:45,387 --> 00:38:47,920
in order to draw
Mr. Ettinger out.

927
00:38:47,922 --> 00:38:49,555
As far as the
FBI goes, well,

928
00:38:49,557 --> 00:38:51,958
I've got some associates
who have created a trail

929
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,860
which will
strongly suggest that Mo

930
00:38:53,862 --> 00:38:55,728
is a cyber-terrorist
I became aware of

931
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:58,197
whilst working for, um...

932
00:38:58,199 --> 00:38:59,766
queen and country.

933
00:38:59,768 --> 00:39:02,135
Your secret's
quite safe.

934
00:39:02,137 --> 00:39:03,903
Thanks.

935
00:39:06,508 --> 00:39:09,776
My reasons for preserving you
are entirely selfish, Harlan.

936
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:13,279
You are a tremendous asset.

937
00:39:13,281 --> 00:39:15,815
I have little doubt

938
00:39:15,817 --> 00:39:19,118
I will need your help again
in the future.

939
00:39:26,461 --> 00:39:28,528
Me or him?

940
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:29,996
You.

941
00:39:29,998 --> 00:39:31,798
I have an update on
that real estate flipper.

942
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,433
I thought you might
want to know.

943
00:39:39,274 --> 00:39:41,908
I tracked down the truck rental
receipts to get her name.

944
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,142
Valerie Cork.

945
00:39:43,144 --> 00:39:44,911
She's an art authenticator.

946
00:39:44,913 --> 00:39:46,779
And that crate you saw?

947
00:39:46,781 --> 00:39:48,414
There was
something called

948
00:39:48,416 --> 00:39:50,683
a scanning fluorescence
spectrometry machine inside.

949
00:39:50,685 --> 00:39:52,251
They're used...
To find paintings

950
00:39:52,253 --> 00:39:53,553
underneath other paintings.

951
00:39:53,555 --> 00:39:55,288
So it turns out
that the building

952
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:56,689
Chad Keswick was looking to buy

953
00:39:56,691 --> 00:39:59,025
was leased by the WPA
during the Depression.

954
00:39:59,027 --> 00:40:00,927
They commissioned a
mural for the lobby.

955
00:40:00,929 --> 00:40:03,329
The artist was a
notorious communist,

956
00:40:03,331 --> 00:40:05,365
so when the property passed
into private hands in the '50s,

957
00:40:05,367 --> 00:40:06,999
the new owners
had it painted over.

958
00:40:07,001 --> 00:40:08,735
But it was still there,
under the paint.

959
00:40:08,737 --> 00:40:11,037
A lost work by Diego Rivera.

960
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:13,473
It's worth ten times
the price of the building.

961
00:40:14,676 --> 00:40:17,043
I was hoping to leak
the truth to the<i> Times.</i>

962
00:40:18,113 --> 00:40:20,046
I promised you a cut of my fee.

963
00:40:20,048 --> 00:40:22,148
But I'm pretty sure
the mural's gonna end up

964
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:24,384
in the hands of
a historical trust.

965
00:40:24,386 --> 00:40:26,352
I'd feel obligated
to refund my client,

966
00:40:26,354 --> 00:40:28,388
which means you'd get
a cut of nothing.

967
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:31,457
That works for me.

968
00:40:31,459 --> 00:40:33,493
Okay.

969
00:40:35,463 --> 00:40:37,397
I think you should know

970
00:40:37,399 --> 00:40:39,732
that I am going
to a meeting tonight.

971
00:40:41,803 --> 00:40:45,505
One of those
support groups for...

972
00:40:45,507 --> 00:40:47,340
people like me.

973
00:40:47,342 --> 00:40:49,876
It was, uh, Sherlock's idea.

974
00:40:49,878 --> 00:40:51,644
That's great.

975
00:40:51,646 --> 00:40:53,446
I know you put him up to it.

976
00:40:53,448 --> 00:40:55,381
We talked.

977
00:40:57,552 --> 00:41:00,219
When he first approached me
in London,

978
00:41:00,221 --> 00:41:03,556
I was...

979
00:41:03,558 --> 00:41:05,558
in a bad way.

980
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,227
And I had been for a while.

981
00:41:08,229 --> 00:41:11,130
But then,
when he talked about

982
00:41:11,132 --> 00:41:12,365
the work that he did,

983
00:41:12,367 --> 00:41:16,035
about the things
that he saw in me...

984
00:41:18,406 --> 00:41:19,739
I want it.

985
00:41:19,741 --> 00:41:21,874
I want every bit
of what's he offered me,

986
00:41:21,876 --> 00:41:23,843
of what he offered you, but...

987
00:41:23,845 --> 00:41:26,212
if I've learned one thing
over the last few weeks,

988
00:41:26,214 --> 00:41:28,047
it's that he can't pull it off.

989
00:41:28,049 --> 00:41:29,682
Not by himself, anyway.

990
00:41:31,586 --> 00:41:34,153
And if I'm gonna get
what I want,

991
00:41:34,155 --> 00:41:37,690
then I'm going to need
your help, too.

992
00:41:40,361 --> 00:41:42,829
I still think
the meetings are bollocks,

993
00:41:42,831 --> 00:41:44,931
but you say they're important.

994
00:41:44,933 --> 00:41:47,967
They matter to you, so...

995
00:41:47,969 --> 00:41:49,735
What do you say, Watson?

996
00:41:49,737 --> 00:41:52,071
Will you help me?

997
00:41:56,277 --> 00:41:58,244
I don't know how it happened.

998
00:41:58,246 --> 00:42:01,547
It just... hit me.

999
00:42:01,549 --> 00:42:03,983
Like a truck, out of nowhere.

1000
00:42:04,853 --> 00:42:07,753
Work is good.

1001
00:42:07,755 --> 00:42:09,755
I have friends.

1002
00:42:09,757 --> 00:42:13,092
I'm in a
relationship.

1003
00:42:13,094 --> 00:42:16,896
Somewhere along
the way, somehow,

1004
00:42:16,898 --> 00:42:19,732
I stopped being a victim

1005
00:42:19,734 --> 00:42:22,602
and became a survivor.

1006
00:42:22,604 --> 00:42:25,705
So, I guess all I'm saying is,
there's hope.

1007
00:42:26,357 --> 00:42:31,686
Do the work. Love yourself.
There's hope.

00:00:11,301 --> 00:00:14,502
What I don't get is
why he isn't wearing a shirt.

8
00:00:14,504 --> 00:00:17,372
He doesn't like anything to come
between him and the numbers.

9
00:00:17,374 --> 00:00:18,415
What is it?

10
00:00:18,438 --> 00:00:20,274
The answers to your questions
about Kitty.

11
00:00:20,276 --> 00:00:22,710
The truth is she was a
victim of a horrific crime.

12
00:00:22,712 --> 00:00:24,646
<i>After you left last night,</i>

13
00:00:24,648 --> 00:00:26,848
Sherlock gave me an envelope.

14
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,249
Sherlock keeps saying

15
00:00:28,251 --> 00:00:30,385
that I need to get
a better sense of you,

16
00:00:30,387 --> 00:00:33,021
and maybe that will give you
a better sense of me.

17
00:00:42,065 --> 00:00:43,065
It's open.

18
00:00:47,637 --> 00:00:49,003
It's nothing.

19
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:50,872
It's Sherlock and
one of his experts.

20
00:00:50,874 --> 00:00:52,006
Which one?

21
00:00:52,008 --> 00:00:53,241
Phillip something.

22
00:00:53,243 --> 00:00:54,575
Must be new.

23
00:00:54,577 --> 00:00:57,445
He's a knife-thrower.

24
00:00:57,447 --> 00:00:58,913
Why does Sherlock have
a knife-thrower?

25
00:00:58,915 --> 00:01:00,748
He got bored the other day,

26
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,185
started looking into this, uh,
circus accident from the '30s.

27
00:01:04,187 --> 00:01:07,922
The Great Galardo perforated one
of his assistants during an act,

28
00:01:07,924 --> 00:01:09,924
except Sherlock thinks
the blade was thrown

29
00:01:09,926 --> 00:01:11,492
by somebody in the stands,
not Galardo.

30
00:01:11,494 --> 00:01:15,096
Phillip, as far as I
can tell, disagrees.

31
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:18,900
It can't be done, okay?

32
00:01:18,902 --> 00:01:19,934
It was done.

33
00:01:19,936 --> 00:01:21,335
You're wrong.

34
00:01:21,337 --> 00:01:23,538
Nobody can chuck
a knife that far.

35
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,239
What's this?

36
00:01:25,241 --> 00:01:26,207
You're...

37
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:27,209
Not here.

38
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,509
I'm not here.

39
00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:29,711
Remember that, okay?

40
00:01:29,713 --> 00:01:31,279
Oh, yes. Heaven
forfend your work

41
00:01:31,281 --> 00:01:33,247
with me should endanger
your precious day job.

42
00:01:33,249 --> 00:01:35,116
You throw knives?

43
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,252
You know, it was supposed
to be just you here.

44
00:01:38,254 --> 00:01:41,355
Phillip is arguably the greatest
knife-thrower in the world.

45
00:01:41,357 --> 00:01:42,790
Has been for decades.

46
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:43,925
Only, there's little money

47
00:01:43,927 --> 00:01:45,193
to be made
in the impalement arts.

48
00:01:45,195 --> 00:01:46,494
So, as a youth, he turned

49
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,563
to what you Americans
term “football”"

50
00:01:48,565 --> 00:01:50,131
Is this a joke?

51
00:01:53,837 --> 00:01:55,002
Phillip, head
and heart.

52
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:56,904
Come on.
Head and heart.

53
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:06,814
Can I go?

54
00:02:06,816 --> 00:02:09,484
Yeah.

55
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,489
15 years he spent throwing
that misshapen ball around.

56
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:16,057
15 years.

57
00:02:16,059 --> 00:02:18,259
When I think of the acclaim
he could have brought

58
00:02:18,261 --> 00:02:20,828
to competitive blade slinging.

59
00:02:27,237 --> 00:02:29,036
You're following me,
Watson.

60
00:02:29,038 --> 00:02:30,338
I don't like it.

61
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,740
I want you to help
me with something.

62
00:02:32,742 --> 00:02:33,908
This is Chad Keswick.

63
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,976
He buys distressed
buildings,

64
00:02:34,978 --> 00:02:36,210
paints, spackles,

65
00:02:36,212 --> 00:02:37,645
and then flips them
for quick money.

66
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:39,180
Who'd he kill?
No one.

67
00:02:39,182 --> 00:02:41,315
I was hired by one of
his rivals to find out

68
00:02:41,317 --> 00:02:43,017
why he's been circling
this old office building

69
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:44,218
in Jamaica, Queens.

70
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,586
She wants to know
why he thinks

71
00:02:45,588 --> 00:02:47,355
the building is
a good investment.

72
00:02:47,357 --> 00:02:49,590
Is there a crime in there,
something worth investigating?

73
00:02:49,592 --> 00:02:50,925
Well, I've been
shadowing Keswick,

74
00:02:50,927 --> 00:02:52,593
but yesterday I think
he noticed me.

75
00:02:52,595 --> 00:02:54,595
I want to switch
up the tail.

76
00:02:54,597 --> 00:02:57,231
You followed me for over
a week before I noticed you.

77
00:02:57,233 --> 00:02:59,033
Help me out, and I'll
cut you in on my fee.

78
00:02:59,035 --> 00:03:02,003
I don't work for you,
I work for Sherlock.

79
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:03,437
I worked for him, too.

80
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,773
And, in my experience,
he was always supportive

81
00:03:05,775 --> 00:03:07,942
of taking on work
outside the partnership.

82
00:03:07,944 --> 00:03:10,912
Sorry, it's not my cup of tea.

83
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:33,034
Hello, Portal Ten.

84
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,247
I'm here, Belphegor.

85
00:03:46,249 --> 00:03:49,784
So where is the next clue?

Yeah, you called it
a puzzle hunt.

91
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,491
Belphegor's Prime.

92
00:04:50,761 --> 00:04:53,262
Think Cicada 3301
or Octorine's Challenge.

93
00:04:54,365 --> 00:04:55,631
They're math games.

94
00:04:55,633 --> 00:04:56,865
Math-- maybe you've heard of it.

95
00:04:56,867 --> 00:04:58,333
I've got some math for you.

96
00:04:58,335 --> 00:05:00,335
One dead guy
plus one live guy

97
00:05:00,337 --> 00:05:02,104
found in the same
deserted factory.

98
00:05:02,106 --> 00:05:06,108
I was not “found” there;
I am the one who called 911.

99
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,310
I was waiting there
for the police.

100
00:05:08,312 --> 00:05:09,745
Mr. Emple,

101
00:05:09,747 --> 00:05:11,613
we're just trying
to do our jobs, all right?

102
00:05:11,615 --> 00:05:13,048
First officers
on the scene described you

103
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,516
as “extremely agitated.”

104
00:05:14,518 --> 00:05:15,984
Well, of course
I was agitated.

105
00:05:15,986 --> 00:05:18,754
I had just found
a dead guy in mothballs!

106
00:05:18,756 --> 00:05:21,790
And did I mention that I have
not slept in almost two days?

107
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:23,358
Because of the math game.

108
00:05:24,762 --> 00:05:26,195
Can I borrow those?

109
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:31,100
This...

110
00:05:31,102 --> 00:05:33,302
is Belphegor's Prime, okay?

111
00:05:33,304 --> 00:05:35,304
It's a numeric palindrome.

112
00:05:35,306 --> 00:05:40,776
It's 666 bookended by 13 zeroes
and then bracketed with ones.

113
00:05:40,778 --> 00:05:43,846
Named for the demon Belphegor
who was a prince of hell.

114
00:05:43,848 --> 00:05:46,448
The first clue for the hunt
started making the rounds

115
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,883
a few months ago.

116
00:05:47,885 --> 00:05:49,651
It was a JPEG with two numbers
hidden in it.

117
00:05:49,653 --> 00:05:51,453
You divide those numbers
by Belphegor's Prime,

118
00:05:51,455 --> 00:05:54,890
and you get the GPS coordinates
for a restroom at the Bronx Zoo.

119
00:05:54,892 --> 00:05:56,959
You go to the restroom,
you find a phone number.

120
00:05:56,961 --> 00:05:58,927
You send a text to the number,
you get the next clue.

121
00:05:58,929 --> 00:05:59,962
Which is another math problem.

122
00:05:59,964 --> 00:06:00,929
Exactly.

123
00:06:00,931 --> 00:06:02,397
Only, this one is harder.

124
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,099
And that's how it works.

125
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:05,934
You know, but for
each one that you solve,

126
00:06:05,936 --> 00:06:08,103
you get a new set
of GPS coordinates.

127
00:06:08,105 --> 00:06:11,473
And that means that you've
completed a stage, or a portal.

128
00:06:11,475 --> 00:06:13,509
And last night,
I was on Portal Ten.

129
00:06:13,511 --> 00:06:15,711
And...

130
00:06:17,014 --> 00:06:18,313
You know what?

131
00:06:18,315 --> 00:06:20,015
I want to talk
to Sherlock and Joan.

132
00:06:20,017 --> 00:06:21,917
Look, Mr. Emple...
No, I'm sorry.

133
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,019
I told the police down
at the factory that I know them.

134
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:25,287
Isn't that the whole reason

135
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:26,922
that I was brought here
to this squad?

136
00:06:26,924 --> 00:06:30,392
I-I am not saying another word
until they are here.

137
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:35,264
Harlan Emple is
indeed an acquaintance.

138
00:06:35,266 --> 00:06:37,733
He is, in point of fact,
one of my “irregulars.”

139
00:06:37,735 --> 00:06:38,801
One of your what?

140
00:06:38,803 --> 00:06:40,302
Irregulars.

141
00:06:40,304 --> 00:06:41,770
I'm your consultant, Captain;
they are mine.

142
00:06:41,772 --> 00:06:43,572
They're a handful
of experts I turn to

143
00:06:43,574 --> 00:06:46,108
when I encounter problems which
are beyond my pool of knowledge.

144
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,810
Harlan is
a brilliant mathematician.

145
00:06:47,812 --> 00:06:49,778
And on the handful of occasions
I have tackled a case

146
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,046
which pertained
to mathematics...

147
00:06:51,048 --> 00:06:53,182
He helped you out.
Well, the good news

148
00:06:53,184 --> 00:06:56,018
for him is the preliminary
autopsy report just came in

149
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,252
before you got here.

150
00:06:57,254 --> 00:06:59,021
And the M.E. puts
the time of death

151
00:06:59,023 --> 00:07:00,989
between 4:00 and
6:00 p.m. last night.

152
00:07:00,991 --> 00:07:02,124
Mr. Emple was teaching

153
00:07:02,126 --> 00:07:03,358
a class at Columbia.

154
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,394
So the victim is
yet to be identified?

155
00:07:05,396 --> 00:07:07,663
No I.D., no phone.

156
00:07:07,665 --> 00:07:09,865
First detective on the scene
liked it for a mob hit,

157
00:07:09,867 --> 00:07:11,500
so while we're
running the prints,

158
00:07:11,502 --> 00:07:13,602
he's showing the vic's
face around OCID.

159
00:07:13,604 --> 00:07:16,839
Marcus here was about to walk
the scene with Mr. Emple.

160
00:07:16,841 --> 00:07:18,774
You're here now;
you might as well tag along.

161
00:07:18,776 --> 00:07:21,009
Actually, Captain,
I'm quite busy today.

162
00:07:21,011 --> 00:07:22,978
This is a John Doe,
and we got nothing.

163
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,247
And, like you just said,
you're my consultant.

164
00:07:25,249 --> 00:07:26,748
So, go consult.

165
00:07:29,787 --> 00:07:30,986
Watson.

166
00:07:30,988 --> 00:07:32,588
Um, he's your friend.

167
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,523
Actually, Kitty is
otherwise engaged,

168
00:07:34,525 --> 00:07:37,426
and he did actually help both
of us with a case last year.

169
00:07:37,428 --> 00:07:38,493
Did he not?

170
00:07:40,865 --> 00:07:44,099
Have I told you
how good it is to see you?

171
00:07:44,101 --> 00:07:45,367
Yes, you have.
Three times.

172
00:07:45,369 --> 00:07:46,468
Well, it is.

173
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,636
Hey, lousy circumstances.

174
00:07:47,638 --> 00:07:49,371
But, uh, hey...

175
00:07:49,373 --> 00:07:51,740
I heard from your boss that you
just, uh, got back from London.

176
00:07:51,742 --> 00:07:53,308
Were you working
a case or...?

177
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,576
No, I moved back there.

178
00:07:54,578 --> 00:07:55,677
You mean<i> moved,</i> moved?

179
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:56,845
Is there another
definition?

180
00:07:56,847 --> 00:07:58,513
I was there for
eight months,

181
00:07:58,515 --> 00:08:00,883
and had a change of heart
and returned to New York.

182
00:08:00,885 --> 00:08:02,517
So, you moved to London,
and you didn't, uh...

183
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,086
You know what?
Doesn't even matter.

184
00:08:04,088 --> 00:08:05,387
The point is you're back!

185
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:07,389
Mr. Emple.
Uh, duty calls.

186
00:08:07,391 --> 00:08:09,024
Yeah.

187
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:18,634
It's interesting.

188
00:08:18,636 --> 00:08:20,068
Mothballs are interesting?

189
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,070
They were taken from
that cabinet over there.

190
00:08:22,072 --> 00:08:25,941
Obviously, to cover the smell
of John Doe's decay.

191
00:08:25,943 --> 00:08:28,043
The killer didn't
bring them with him.

192
00:08:28,045 --> 00:08:31,179
Perhaps leaving the body here
was not part of his plan, hmm?

193
00:08:32,983 --> 00:08:36,018
Doe was shot in the foot
first and then the knee.

194
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,453
Either those were
two really bad misses or...

195
00:08:38,455 --> 00:08:41,256
Or the killer was torturing him.

196
00:08:41,258 --> 00:08:43,892
This doesn't seem like anything
you can't handle on your own.

197
00:08:43,894 --> 00:08:45,994
So you want to tell me why you
really asked me to come here?

198
00:08:45,996 --> 00:08:48,363
“This doesn't seem like anything
you can't handle on your own.”

199
00:08:48,365 --> 00:08:49,765
That's funny.

200
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:51,566
That's exactly what
I would have said

201
00:08:51,568 --> 00:08:53,602
had I been present when you
asked Kitty for her assistance

202
00:08:53,604 --> 00:08:54,937
with your tawdry side job.

203
00:08:54,939 --> 00:08:57,372
“Tawdry”?
I wanted you to know I approve.

204
00:08:57,374 --> 00:08:59,007
Of what?

205
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:01,376
Your agenda
with regards to Kitty.

206
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:03,078
Several days ago,
I gave you her file.

207
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,913
And then you show up at
the brownstone yesterday,

208
00:09:04,915 --> 00:09:06,515
and you invite her
into an investigation.

209
00:09:06,517 --> 00:09:08,183
Coincidence? No, I think not.

210
00:09:08,185 --> 00:09:11,320
You feel for her.
And now you wish to engage.

211
00:09:11,322 --> 00:09:13,956
It's not an outcome
I would have predicted, no.

212
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,458
But it is one
I approve of, yeah.

213
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,193
She could learn
a great deal from you,

214
00:09:18,195 --> 00:09:20,228
especially with regards
to how to get the most

215
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,864
from my tutelage.

216
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:25,734
So, I've already dispatched her
to, uh, follow your Mr. Keswick.

217
00:09:25,736 --> 00:09:27,836
But that's not
what I actually...

218
00:09:27,838 --> 00:09:29,404
Harlan!

219
00:09:30,741 --> 00:09:33,075
You came here to retrieve
a phone number, did you not?

220
00:09:33,077 --> 00:09:34,609
You would send a text,
and then receive

221
00:09:34,611 --> 00:09:36,845
the next clue in the game
that you were playing.

222
00:09:36,847 --> 00:09:38,747
Yeah, but I didn't find it.

223
00:09:38,749 --> 00:09:40,048
Not that I kept looking

224
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,250
after the dead guy
fell out of the locker.

225
00:09:42,252 --> 00:09:44,052
Yeah, CSU didn't find
any number either.

226
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:46,154
Probably because
it's under that paint.

227
00:09:46,156 --> 00:09:48,190
It's fresh.

228
00:09:48,192 --> 00:09:49,891
Applied in the last

229
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:52,694
24 hours.

230
00:09:52,696 --> 00:09:54,696
Right after John Doe's murder,
I'd wager.

231
00:09:54,698 --> 00:09:57,099
You don't think
this was a mob hit?

232
00:09:57,101 --> 00:09:59,101
Doe and the killer were
playing the game, too.

233
00:09:59,103 --> 00:10:01,203
The killer shot Doe and
then covered up the number

234
00:10:01,205 --> 00:10:02,704
so no one else could use it.

235
00:10:02,706 --> 00:10:04,806
What's the prize
in your little contest?

236
00:10:04,808 --> 00:10:07,576
Well, I'm doing it
mostly for the math.

237
00:10:07,578 --> 00:10:11,480
But, uh, $1,707,071.

238
00:10:11,482 --> 00:10:13,882
It's another
palindromic prime.

239
00:10:13,884 --> 00:10:17,152
Did I not mention the
money at the station?

240
00:10:17,154 --> 00:10:18,587
Who the hell can afford

241
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:20,655
that kind of payout
for a puzzle hunt?

242
00:10:20,657 --> 00:10:22,124
Well, most people
think it's CAML.

243
00:10:22,126 --> 00:10:24,593
The Center for Applied
Mathematics and Logic.

244
00:10:24,595 --> 00:10:26,094
It's located
in Ramapo...

245
00:10:26,096 --> 00:10:27,729
Wait, most people
“think” it's them?

246
00:10:27,731 --> 00:10:29,331
Well, hunts like these,

247
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,266
the organizers are
almost always anonymous.

248
00:10:31,268 --> 00:10:32,401
It's S.O.P.

249
00:10:32,403 --> 00:10:34,302
What about the
contestants?

250
00:10:34,304 --> 00:10:37,005
Is anonymity
also S.O.P.?

251
00:10:37,007 --> 00:10:39,207
For the most part, yeah.

252
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:43,078
But, guys, math peeps
are my peeps, okay?

253
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,314
It's, uh, like
a community, sort of.

254
00:10:46,316 --> 00:10:48,984
I can think of ten
or 12 other people

255
00:10:48,986 --> 00:10:50,018
who were probably competing.

256
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,186
Would that help?

257
00:10:53,157 --> 00:10:55,223
No.

258
00:10:55,225 --> 00:10:58,026
I'm sorry, I don't know him.

259
00:10:58,028 --> 00:11:00,862
But you admit you were
competing in Belphegor's Prime.

260
00:11:00,864 --> 00:11:02,197
I do.

261
00:11:04,835 --> 00:11:05,934
Pepe!

262
00:11:08,172 --> 00:11:10,439
Sorry. He doesn't
like strangers.

263
00:11:12,109 --> 00:11:14,443
Give him one of these.

264
00:11:14,445 --> 00:11:16,111
Get on his good side.

265
00:11:24,288 --> 00:11:26,354
What are you doing?

266
00:11:28,225 --> 00:11:30,725
I'm just verifying that
you've been lying to us.

267
00:11:30,727 --> 00:11:33,895
You did know the
dead man, did you not?

268
00:11:33,897 --> 00:11:36,998
I reviewed his personal
effects at the morgue earlier.

269
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,034
The coroner reported finding
crumbs in one of his pockets.

270
00:11:39,036 --> 00:11:40,036
I tasted one.

271
00:11:40,037 --> 00:11:41,269
Why would you...?

272
00:11:41,271 --> 00:11:42,771
At first, I thought
they were from

273
00:11:42,773 --> 00:11:44,439
a particularly rancid
brand of cheese,

274
00:11:44,441 --> 00:11:47,609
but, no... they're from
one of Pepe's treats.

275
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:49,277
Homemade?

276
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,481
Harlan was able to give us
the names of nine other people

277
00:11:52,483 --> 00:11:54,149
he believed to be
other competitors.

278
00:11:54,151 --> 00:11:55,984
Our colleagues are
investigating them as we speak,

279
00:11:55,986 --> 00:11:57,919
but I'll quite happily
recommend that the NYPD

280
00:11:57,921 --> 00:12:00,222
focus its attention
entirely on you.

281
00:12:04,128 --> 00:12:06,428
His name was Ike Walaczek.

282
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,231
In another lifetime,
he was my boyfriend.

283
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:10,866
And what of
this lifetime?

284
00:12:10,868 --> 00:12:12,701
We were working together.

285
00:12:12,703 --> 00:12:14,769
On Belphegor's.
What?!

286
00:12:14,771 --> 00:12:16,705
He was a numerical analyst
at the Tory Foundation.

287
00:12:16,707 --> 00:12:17,873
I work mostly in combinatorics.

288
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,307
I thought we would make
a good team.

289
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:20,742
But there aren't
supposed to be teams.

290
00:12:20,744 --> 00:12:22,711
Not in a puzzle hunt.
It's bad form.

291
00:12:22,713 --> 00:12:23,713
Harlan...

292
00:12:23,714 --> 00:12:25,514
I'm just saying...

293
00:12:25,516 --> 00:12:27,315
My husband
wouldn't understand,

294
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:30,385
so I decided I wouldn't tell him
until after we won the money.

295
00:12:30,387 --> 00:12:33,121
A team-- so that's how
you got there before me.

296
00:12:33,123 --> 00:12:34,489
I wasn't there.

297
00:12:34,491 --> 00:12:36,258
Tom and I were out of town
until this morning.

298
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,126
His cousin
was getting married in Hawaii.

299
00:12:38,128 --> 00:12:40,662
That's why Ike went
to the coordinates by himself.

300
00:12:40,664 --> 00:12:42,097
Because I couldn't.

301
00:12:44,268 --> 00:12:46,601
These are pictures I took.

302
00:12:46,603 --> 00:12:49,337
Check the dates.

303
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:51,506
You gave the police
nine other names?

304
00:12:51,508 --> 00:12:53,408
People you thought
were competing?

305
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,776
I've got 16.

306
00:12:54,778 --> 00:12:56,311
And I know they were competing.

307
00:12:58,448 --> 00:13:01,249
He talked to her
outside the Jamaica property

308
00:13:01,251 --> 00:13:05,720
for about 20 minutes,
and then this truck rolled up.

309
00:13:05,722 --> 00:13:07,822
Any idea what's
inside the crate?

310
00:13:07,824 --> 00:13:09,024
Nope.

311
00:13:09,026 --> 00:13:10,392
I can't identify
the woman either.

312
00:13:10,394 --> 00:13:12,260
Everything about her
said money though.

313
00:13:12,262 --> 00:13:15,363
She, Keswick
and the mystery box

314
00:13:15,365 --> 00:13:17,732
stayed inside the building
for about three hours,

315
00:13:17,734 --> 00:13:20,001
and then off they went.

316
00:13:20,904 --> 00:13:22,170
Good.

317
00:13:22,172 --> 00:13:23,872
Okay.

318
00:13:23,874 --> 00:13:26,074
You know where
to send the check.

319
00:13:26,076 --> 00:13:30,145
You haven't asked me about
the file Sherlock gave me.

320
00:13:30,147 --> 00:13:32,080
Why would I?

321
00:13:32,082 --> 00:13:36,184
You said it would give me
a better sense of you-- it did.

322
00:13:37,588 --> 00:13:40,155
That's why you asked
for my help.

323
00:13:40,157 --> 00:13:41,990
Because you felt sorry for me.

324
00:13:41,992 --> 00:13:44,226
No.

325
00:13:44,228 --> 00:13:46,194
You just don't seem interested
in anything

326
00:13:46,196 --> 00:13:48,063
outside of becoming
a detective.

327
00:13:48,065 --> 00:13:50,999
There she is.

328
00:13:51,001 --> 00:13:53,301
The old counselor.

329
00:13:53,303 --> 00:13:55,637
Who used to hold
Sherlock's hand.

330
00:13:57,608 --> 00:13:59,741
Everything that you read,

331
00:13:59,743 --> 00:14:02,510
everything that happened to me,
that's all it is.

332
00:14:02,512 --> 00:14:04,646
It's just something
that happened.

333
00:14:04,648 --> 00:14:08,116
And it's all
in the past now.

334
00:14:08,118 --> 00:14:10,685
So let's just
leave it there, shall we?

335
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:24,667
Hello.

336
00:14:24,668 --> 00:14:26,001
You've had sex.

337
00:14:26,003 --> 00:14:27,202
Excuse me?

338
00:14:27,204 --> 00:14:28,503
I can hear it
in your voice.

339
00:14:28,505 --> 00:14:29,771
You've joined paunches.

340
00:14:29,773 --> 00:14:30,972
Good for you, Watson.

341
00:14:30,974 --> 00:14:32,807
As you know, I think
the act of love

342
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:34,676
can be quite conducive to...
What do you want?

343
00:14:34,678 --> 00:14:36,911
Merely to apprise you
of a new development

344
00:14:36,913 --> 00:14:38,280
in the murder of
Ike Walaczek.

345
00:14:38,282 --> 00:14:40,115
As I informed
you yesterday,

346
00:14:40,117 --> 00:14:42,284
Harlan and I were given
a new list of competitors.

347
00:14:42,286 --> 00:14:45,320
One name leapt out:
Byron Lowenthal.

348
00:14:45,322 --> 00:14:48,156
He's a statistician at the
Public Utilities Commission

349
00:14:48,158 --> 00:14:50,425
and a diagnosed
paranoid schizophrenic.

350
00:14:50,427 --> 00:14:52,160
He's been hospitalized
for becoming violent

351
00:14:52,162 --> 00:14:53,728
on no fewer
than three occasions.

352
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,964
Certainly sounds like
it could be our guy.

353
00:14:55,966 --> 00:14:59,367
Unfortunately, Mr. Lowenthal had
another break earlier this year.

354
00:14:59,369 --> 00:15:02,137
He's been staying in
a transient hotel ever since.

355
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:04,239
Detective Bell and I
are going to speak with him.

356
00:15:04,241 --> 00:15:05,307
You want me to meet you?

357
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:06,875
Oh, no, we're already here.

358
00:15:06,877 --> 00:15:08,410
Anyway, now that I know
that you've enjoyed coitus

359
00:15:08,412 --> 00:15:09,778
and could enjoy more
in the near future...

360
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,846
When you're done,
we need to talk.

361
00:15:14,718 --> 00:15:16,818
Byron Lowenthal,
you in there?

362
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,053
Who is it?

363
00:15:18,055 --> 00:15:19,754
It's Detective Bell, NYPD.

364
00:15:19,756 --> 00:15:22,257
My colleague and I would like
to ask you some questions.

365
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:24,592
Let me
get some pants on.

366
00:15:37,341 --> 00:15:40,008
S-Sorry, I just... I, um...

367
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,310
I-I thought I heard
Mr. Lowenthal retr...

368
00:16:19,154 --> 00:16:21,267
You guys got lucky.

369
00:16:21,268 --> 00:16:22,868
Well, luck had little
to do with it, actually.

370
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,536
I... I heard Mr. Lowenthal

371
00:16:24,538 --> 00:16:27,039
pulling a heavy object off
a shelf, placing it on his bed,

372
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,041
and the sound of
the zipper indicated

373
00:16:29,043 --> 00:16:30,976
that it was
a large gun case.

374
00:16:30,978 --> 00:16:33,579
Looks like he was sane enough
to do math, but not much else.

375
00:16:33,581 --> 00:16:34,747
Plus, he was
pretty hopped up.

376
00:16:34,749 --> 00:16:36,448
Caffeine pills,
energy drinks,

377
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,251
pretty much every legal
stimulant you can buy.

378
00:16:39,253 --> 00:16:40,853
Plus a few illegal ones.

379
00:16:40,855 --> 00:16:42,821
Hmm. Obviously, he was
keeping himself awake

380
00:16:42,823 --> 00:16:44,490
so he could work on
Belphegor's.

381
00:16:44,492 --> 00:16:47,392
This... is obvious to you?

382
00:16:47,394 --> 00:16:48,961
I confess the maths
are beyond me,

383
00:16:48,963 --> 00:16:51,130
but I took the liberty of
sending pictures of what

384
00:16:51,132 --> 00:16:52,865
appear to be Mr. Lowenthal's
most recent scribbles

385
00:16:52,867 --> 00:16:54,166
to Harlan Emple,
and he's confirmed

386
00:16:54,168 --> 00:16:55,667
they are part of the contest.

387
00:16:55,669 --> 00:16:56,969
With your permission,
I'd like copies of these

388
00:16:56,971 --> 00:16:58,837
sent to my home
so he can review them.

389
00:16:58,839 --> 00:16:59,972
What for?

390
00:16:59,974 --> 00:17:01,073
If Byron Lowenthal

391
00:17:01,075 --> 00:17:02,441
did kill Ike Walaczek,

392
00:17:02,443 --> 00:17:04,109
then he used
and obscured a phone number,

393
00:17:04,111 --> 00:17:05,878
which would have yielded
the next problem.

394
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,379
That problem's solution

395
00:17:07,381 --> 00:17:08,714
would be GPS coordinates.

396
00:17:08,716 --> 00:17:10,415
If he's recorded them
in his books...

397
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:12,551
Your pal will be able to tell us
where he's headed next.

398
00:17:12,553 --> 00:17:14,853
I'll get our guys to give you

399
00:17:14,855 --> 00:17:16,388
whatever you need.

400
00:17:17,258 --> 00:17:18,991
Scans are still coming through,

401
00:17:18,993 --> 00:17:21,260
but I've put what we've got
so far up on the wall.

402
00:17:21,262 --> 00:17:23,262
Sherlock said that
you prefer it that way.

403
00:17:23,264 --> 00:17:25,030
Picked it up from him,
actually.

404
00:17:25,032 --> 00:17:28,600
Makes me feel like I'm really
inside of the problem.

405
00:17:30,704 --> 00:17:33,372
I'll, uh, let you know
if I need anything.

406
00:17:34,275 --> 00:17:35,974
Oh, I work without a shirt.

407
00:17:35,976 --> 00:17:38,911
Sometimes makes me feel
closer to the numbers.

408
00:17:38,913 --> 00:17:42,147
You'll need to, uh,
check the printer in the study

409
00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:43,615
for more pages.

410
00:17:43,617 --> 00:17:45,417
Uh, this is nice,
you know?

411
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:47,452
Meeting another member
of the team.

412
00:17:47,454 --> 00:17:48,654
You know, Team Sherlock.

413
00:17:48,656 --> 00:17:50,656
You help him, I help him...

414
00:17:51,926 --> 00:17:53,559
Obviously, you haven't
tackled a case

415
00:17:53,561 --> 00:17:55,093
with high-order math since
you started working with him,

416
00:17:55,095 --> 00:17:57,729
or we would've...

417
00:17:57,731 --> 00:17:59,031
What?

418
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:00,232
What?

419
00:18:00,234 --> 00:18:01,834
Wait...

420
00:18:01,836 --> 00:18:04,002
have you worked a case
with high-order math?

421
00:18:04,805 --> 00:18:06,238
You have, haven't you?

422
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,840
Does it matter?

423
00:18:07,842 --> 00:18:09,842
Of course it...

424
00:18:09,844 --> 00:18:11,443
Oh, my God.

425
00:18:11,445 --> 00:18:13,278
Did he fire me?

426
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,980
All I know
is that back in London,

427
00:18:14,982 --> 00:18:16,982
we worked a case that involved
Fibonacci spirals...

428
00:18:16,984 --> 00:18:18,483
He fired me.

429
00:18:18,485 --> 00:18:21,386
...and he called some woman
named Indira Patel.

430
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,856
She's at Berkeley.

431
00:18:23,858 --> 00:18:25,624
I'm three time zones closer!

432
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:27,125
You're here now.

433
00:18:27,127 --> 00:18:29,428
Sure, because I found
a dead body.

434
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,531
I have to go; I have to run
some errands for Sherlock.

435
00:18:35,936 --> 00:18:37,903
I-I don't know
what was in the crate,

436
00:18:37,905 --> 00:18:39,271
but the stenciling on
the side indicates

437
00:18:39,273 --> 00:18:40,772
it came from one of
the SUNY schools.

438
00:18:40,774 --> 00:18:42,908
I put another detective
on Keswick...

439
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:45,177
Don't kill me, I had to
use your razor to shave.

440
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:47,179
I...

441
00:18:47,181 --> 00:18:49,147
You must be Andrew.

442
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:50,515
Sherlock Holmes.

443
00:18:50,517 --> 00:18:52,551
Sorry.

444
00:18:52,553 --> 00:18:55,487
Joan said you were coming;
I... I forgot.

445
00:18:55,489 --> 00:18:57,122
It's not how
I wanted to meet you.

446
00:18:57,124 --> 00:18:58,891
She said you can tell
a lot about people

447
00:18:58,893 --> 00:19:00,192
just by looking at them.

448
00:19:00,194 --> 00:19:02,261
I swear, I...
usually wear pants.

449
00:19:02,263 --> 00:19:03,729
Well, in my experience,
most people

450
00:19:03,731 --> 00:19:05,264
need only be concerned
I won't notice

451
00:19:05,266 --> 00:19:06,498
anything worth remarking upon.

452
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:10,535
Watson seems adequately sexed.

453
00:19:11,939 --> 00:19:13,672
Hey.

454
00:19:13,674 --> 00:19:15,674
I was just introducing myself.

455
00:19:17,945 --> 00:19:20,379
I've got that thing.
I'll see you tonight.

456
00:19:20,381 --> 00:19:21,580
Okay.

457
00:19:27,855 --> 00:19:30,188
Your home, Watson...

458
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,823
it's utterly pleasant.

459
00:19:31,825 --> 00:19:33,692
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

460
00:19:33,694 --> 00:19:35,394
When you told me
you wanted a life of your own,

461
00:19:35,396 --> 00:19:36,595
I didn't realize
that you meant you wanted

462
00:19:36,597 --> 00:19:38,030
the same life everyone else has.

463
00:19:38,032 --> 00:19:39,464
But at any rate,
none of my business, is it?

464
00:19:39,466 --> 00:19:41,233
It's not.
And I didn't ask you here

465
00:19:41,235 --> 00:19:42,634
to talk about my apartment.

466
00:19:42,636 --> 00:19:44,970
No, you asked me here
to discuss Kitty.

467
00:19:44,972 --> 00:19:46,471
If she were not
the topic of conversation,

468
00:19:46,473 --> 00:19:48,941
then you wouldn't have
invited me to your home,

469
00:19:48,943 --> 00:19:50,776
where there's no chance
she'll be present.

470
00:19:52,346 --> 00:19:53,946
She disappointed you
in some way.

471
00:19:53,948 --> 00:19:55,247
Skills not up to snuff?

472
00:19:55,249 --> 00:19:57,316
Please remember
she is a novice.

473
00:19:57,318 --> 00:19:58,850
Actually, she did a great job.

474
00:19:58,852 --> 00:20:00,285
But I have some concerns.

475
00:20:00,287 --> 00:20:01,954
I thought we could
talk about them.

476
00:20:03,757 --> 00:20:04,923
You think that
Kitty needs help

477
00:20:04,925 --> 00:20:06,091
above and beyond
my mentorship.

478
00:20:06,093 --> 00:20:07,392
You read the same
file I did.

479
00:20:07,394 --> 00:20:08,894
She's a rape victim.

480
00:20:08,896 --> 00:20:11,296
She was kept and tortured.

481
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,899
Mm.

482
00:20:16,136 --> 00:20:19,171
You know me, so surely you know

483
00:20:19,173 --> 00:20:22,874
I've broached the subject of
a support group meeting before.

484
00:20:22,876 --> 00:20:25,010
Even offered
to pay for therapy.

485
00:20:25,012 --> 00:20:26,812
She's not interested, I know.

486
00:20:26,814 --> 00:20:28,447
Just as you also know

487
00:20:28,449 --> 00:20:30,749
someone with a problem
can't be forced to get help.

488
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:32,551
They have to want it.

489
00:20:32,553 --> 00:20:34,786
What Kitty wants
is to be a detective.

490
00:20:36,523 --> 00:20:38,490
I am taking pains
to try and channel

491
00:20:38,492 --> 00:20:40,592
her residual feelings
into her work.

492
00:20:42,329 --> 00:20:44,463
Well, that works out
great for you.

493
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:48,400
You told me that
you took on a partner

494
00:20:48,402 --> 00:20:50,635
because you wanted to replicate
what you and I had.

495
00:20:50,637 --> 00:20:52,637
That you thought it helped
with your recovery.

496
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:54,539
You think I would
try and take advantage

497
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,208
of the victim of a trauma?

498
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,910
Of course not, but there is
a conflict of interest here.

499
00:20:58,912 --> 00:21:02,447
She needs what she needs,
but you need what you need, too.

500
00:21:06,053 --> 00:21:10,055
It's-it's good that you're
in her life now, Watson.

501
00:21:10,057 --> 00:21:12,524
I mean,
it's commonly believed that, um,

502
00:21:12,526 --> 00:21:16,228
a child benefits mostly from
the presence of two parents.

503
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,164
He-- or she, in this case--
can absorb certain qualities

504
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,466
from the father--
clear-eyed view of the world,

505
00:21:21,468 --> 00:21:23,168
capacity of
rational thought, etcetera.

506
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,170
They can also absorb certain
qualities from the mother.

507
00:21:25,172 --> 00:21:27,105
Excuse me, but I am not
Kitty's mother,

508
00:21:27,107 --> 00:21:28,807
and she sure as hell
is not our child.

509
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:30,942
You brought her here;
she looks up to you.

510
00:21:30,944 --> 00:21:32,944
She says that she doesn't
need help-- fine--

511
00:21:32,946 --> 00:21:34,579
but you know better.

512
00:21:34,581 --> 00:21:37,082
And you're gonna have to be
the one that tells her.

513
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,620
It's Harlan.

514
00:21:41,622 --> 00:21:44,523
Making progress with the maths.

515
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,660
We thought
that Byron and Ike

516
00:21:48,662 --> 00:21:50,462
arrived at Portal Ten
simultaneously.

517
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,664
That would've meant that they
were doing all the same math

518
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,032
at essentially
the same time.

519
00:21:54,034 --> 00:21:56,001
Only, the math
you found at Byron's place

520
00:21:56,003 --> 00:21:57,003
says that's wrong.

521
00:21:57,004 --> 00:21:58,470
He was one step behind Ike.

522
00:21:58,472 --> 00:22:00,705
Are you proposing he did
not kill Mr. Walaczek?

523
00:22:00,707 --> 00:22:03,175
I don't know, but that's
not the weirdest part.

524
00:22:03,177 --> 00:22:04,810
Byron was obsessive.

525
00:22:04,812 --> 00:22:06,211
He time-stamped
almost everything he did.

526
00:22:06,213 --> 00:22:09,047
He only solved
the Portal Nine problem,

527
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:11,316
the same problem that sent me
to that old factory last night.

528
00:22:11,318 --> 00:22:12,884
But get this--

529
00:22:12,886 --> 00:22:14,686
he wasn't given
the same problem as me.

530
00:22:14,688 --> 00:22:16,655
And so it would've yielded
GPS coordinates

531
00:22:16,657 --> 00:22:18,323
for an entirely
different location.

532
00:22:18,325 --> 00:22:21,760
The person in charge of
the game changed the clue

533
00:22:21,762 --> 00:22:23,328
after the police
found Ike's body.

534
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:25,964
Well, he had to, right?

535
00:22:25,966 --> 00:22:27,899
If he hadn't, he would be
sending other competitors

536
00:22:27,901 --> 00:22:29,101
to an active crime scene.

537
00:22:29,103 --> 00:22:30,402
The important thing is

538
00:22:30,404 --> 00:22:31,536
I figured out the coordinates

539
00:22:31,538 --> 00:22:32,771
to the second location.

540
00:22:32,773 --> 00:22:35,540
I know where Byron went.

541
00:22:35,542 --> 00:22:36,842
What are you doing?

542
00:22:36,844 --> 00:22:38,410
You're saying he
time-stamped everything.

543
00:22:38,412 --> 00:22:40,345
I'm looking at the time
he received his clues.

544
00:22:40,347 --> 00:22:42,647
It's all there, to the second,
but what does that have to do...

545
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:44,149
What if you hadn't
found a body?

546
00:22:44,151 --> 00:22:46,118
If the game had
proceeded as planned,

547
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,486
what were you meant
to do there?

548
00:22:47,488 --> 00:22:49,354
I would have sent a text
to the phone number,

549
00:22:49,356 --> 00:22:51,523
the one that the killer painted
over, and then I would have

550
00:22:51,525 --> 00:22:52,891
gotten a message back
with the next problem.

551
00:22:52,893 --> 00:22:54,559
There's an extra
step in there.

552
00:22:54,561 --> 00:22:56,428
Why all this rigmarole with
phone numbers and texts?

553
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,064
Why not just post the problem
itself at the factory?

554
00:22:59,066 --> 00:23:02,100
I don't know, it's just the way
the game is played.

555
00:23:02,102 --> 00:23:04,102
They're for an old
industrial area in Queens.

556
00:23:04,104 --> 00:23:06,805
You're welcome
for finding your suspect.

557
00:23:06,807 --> 00:23:09,207
If I'm right, Harlan,
what you've found...

558
00:23:09,209 --> 00:23:11,109
is the site of
another murder.

559
00:23:11,111 --> 00:23:13,245
Byron Lowenthal's.

560
00:23:15,983 --> 00:23:18,216
You were right,
Lowenthal's dead.

561
00:23:18,218 --> 00:23:20,952
He was shot in the foot,
then the knee.

562
00:23:20,954 --> 00:23:22,821
Just like
Ike Wallaczek.

563
00:23:22,823 --> 00:23:26,391
I'm, uh, gonna look
over here now.

564
00:23:26,393 --> 00:23:29,427
Well, we think the perp
was pulling the body

565
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:31,429
to a car that was parked
over there.

566
00:23:31,431 --> 00:23:34,065
Then he just
left him here.

567
00:23:34,067 --> 00:23:35,901
Probably afraid
he'd been spotted.

568
00:23:35,903 --> 00:23:38,803
There's a lot
of homeless in the area.

569
00:23:41,441 --> 00:23:43,008
Question is:

570
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:45,010
how'd you know
Lowenthal was the next victim

571
00:23:45,012 --> 00:23:46,511
and not the killer?

572
00:23:49,316 --> 00:23:51,750
Well, that's
quite simple, really.

573
00:23:51,752 --> 00:23:54,352
The game is directing
its players to remote locales,

574
00:23:54,354 --> 00:23:56,788
and then instructing them
to send a text message

575
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,256
indicating their presence.

576
00:23:58,258 --> 00:24:00,125
I suspect the killer wanted
to remove the body

577
00:24:00,127 --> 00:24:02,928
so he could keep this new
location “in play,” so to speak.

578
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:05,130
Still missing the “simple” part.

579
00:24:05,132 --> 00:24:06,698
The late Mr. Lowenthal

580
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,366
received his final clue

581
00:24:08,368 --> 00:24:10,235
after Harlan discovered
Ike Wallaczek's body,

582
00:24:10,237 --> 00:24:12,737
but before news of the killing
had reached the media.

583
00:24:12,739 --> 00:24:14,439
That means the
game's designer

584
00:24:14,441 --> 00:24:16,408
knew the location
had been compromised.

585
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,577
And the only way
that he could have known that,

586
00:24:18,579 --> 00:24:20,111
at the time that he knew it,

587
00:24:20,113 --> 00:24:21,880
was if he, himself,
was the killer.

588
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,917
Belphegor's Prime is not
a treasure hunt.

589
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,619
It's a trap.

590
00:24:40,696 --> 00:24:42,196
Better?

591
00:24:42,198 --> 00:24:44,665
False alarm.

592
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:47,668
But I still feel
a little queasy.

593
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,273
This new dead guy--

594
00:24:52,275 --> 00:24:54,875
your friend said that he was
tortured, too, right?

595
00:24:54,877 --> 00:24:57,244
Right before the killer tried
to abscond with his corpse.

596
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:59,213
I assume
he intended to take

597
00:24:59,215 --> 00:25:02,383
Ike Wallaczek away with him
as well, only Ike was too large.

598
00:25:02,385 --> 00:25:04,685
A speedy mothballing
was the best he could do.

599
00:25:04,687 --> 00:25:07,221
So, just to recap,

600
00:25:07,223 --> 00:25:09,657
I've spent the last
few months of my life

601
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:13,360
playing a game that was
designed to kill me.

602
00:25:13,362 --> 00:25:15,629
Got to be a metaphor
in there somewhere, right?

603
00:25:15,631 --> 00:25:18,966
I think the word you're
looking for is “moral.”

604
00:25:18,968 --> 00:25:21,902
There is a moral in there:
games are for idiots.

605
00:25:24,707 --> 00:25:26,473
Breaking news from Ramapo.

606
00:25:26,475 --> 00:25:29,443
Kitty reports the Center for
Applied Mathematics and Logic

607
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,912
is not the sponsor
of Belphegor's Prime.

608
00:25:31,914 --> 00:25:34,148
Then it's got to be
a serial killer, right?

609
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,716
Someone who's obsessed
with mathematicians?

610
00:25:35,718 --> 00:25:37,284
Mm.

611
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,920
Perhaps he was bullied
by mathematicians as a child.

612
00:25:39,922 --> 00:25:42,056
Or mathematicians
killed his parents.

613
00:25:42,058 --> 00:25:43,657
I'm being serious.

614
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:45,726
Serial killers who devise
elaborate death traps

615
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,461
are the stuff of pulp fiction.

616
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:49,229
And besides, with respect
to these murders,

617
00:25:49,231 --> 00:25:51,165
there are none
of the elaborations

618
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:53,767
which mark that sort of culprit.

619
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:55,970
If anything, I would describe
the work as businesslike.

620
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:58,172
Then it's the government.

621
00:25:58,174 --> 00:26:01,241
I mean, the-the game was some
sort of test to weed out people

622
00:26:01,243 --> 00:26:03,243
who could weaponize math.

623
00:26:03,245 --> 00:26:05,179
The American intelligence
apparatus may be clod-like,

624
00:26:05,181 --> 00:26:07,014
but I think they would
do a better job

625
00:26:07,016 --> 00:26:08,749
of disposing of two bodies,
don't you?

626
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:11,785
Watson?

627
00:26:11,787 --> 00:26:13,621
I just heard
from one of the suspects

628
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:14,922
Marcus and I talked to
yesterday,

629
00:26:14,924 --> 00:26:16,290
another puzzle-hunter.

630
00:26:16,292 --> 00:26:18,525
Tell me he confessed
to the murders.

631
00:26:18,527 --> 00:26:20,427
We ruled him out right away,
but he heard about

632
00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:22,329
Byron Lowenthal's murder on
the news and wanted me to know

633
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:25,165
he's at a friend's place,
some guy named Paul.

634
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,934
That is fascinating.

635
00:26:26,936 --> 00:26:28,369
Actually, it might be.

636
00:26:28,371 --> 00:26:31,038
Paul is positive he knows
who the killer is.

637
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,807
I know the guards
are a bit much,

638
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:35,509
but I wanted everyone
to feel safe.

639
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:38,178
And, besides,
math has been good to me.

640
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,279
Commodities.

641
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:40,848
So, you and your friends,

642
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:43,150
you were competitors
in Belphegor's Prime?

643
00:26:43,152 --> 00:26:45,352
Most of us. Some of the others
are just here for the math.

644
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,121
You said you could
identify the killer.

645
00:26:47,123 --> 00:26:49,323
I can, sort of.

646
00:26:52,061 --> 00:26:54,194
“Mo Shellshocker.”

647
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:56,930
It's a pseudonym,
obviously, but I'm telling you,

648
00:26:56,932 --> 00:26:58,365
this is the guy
you're looking for.

649
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,600
I've heard of him.

650
00:26:59,602 --> 00:27:01,335
He uses his blog
to expose bad math.

651
00:27:01,337 --> 00:27:03,837
Corrupt economists, biased
pollsters, that sort of thing.

652
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:05,572
He's actually
sort of a crusader.

653
00:27:05,574 --> 00:27:06,574
He's a murderer.

654
00:27:06,575 --> 00:27:09,143
How can you be
so sure?

655
00:27:09,145 --> 00:27:10,744
When he isn't crusading,
he's competing in puzzle hunts.

656
00:27:10,746 --> 00:27:11,812
A few months ago,

657
00:27:11,814 --> 00:27:13,080
he claimed to
have solved

658
00:27:13,082 --> 00:27:14,815
Cicada 3301 two
years in a row.

659
00:27:14,817 --> 00:27:17,484
Some people called BS,
including...

660
00:27:17,486 --> 00:27:20,120
Ike Wallaczek
and Byron Lowenthal.

661
00:27:20,122 --> 00:27:21,221
“WallaCheckYourMath,”

662
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:22,489
“ByLow2020.”

663
00:27:22,491 --> 00:27:23,757
Those are their
online handles.

664
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:25,392
Their friends
will confirm it.

665
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,528
A flame war does not
a murderer make.

666
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:30,097
The stuff these guys were
slinging at each other was ugly.

667
00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:32,099
Mo knew they were into hunts,
and so he built one

668
00:27:32,101 --> 00:27:34,034
that would send them to places
where he could kill them.

669
00:27:34,036 --> 00:27:35,469
That's what we're
doing here is

670
00:27:35,471 --> 00:27:36,837
we're just sifting
through all the math

671
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:38,338
he's posted on his blog
over the years,

672
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,840
to see if we could
find his signature

673
00:27:39,842 --> 00:27:41,975
or something that
could identify him.

674
00:27:41,977 --> 00:27:45,279
If two people weren't dead,
we'd probably be having fun.

675
00:27:45,281 --> 00:27:46,747
But still, the
chances that he left

676
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:48,582
something like that
in his math...

677
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,784
If it's there, we'll find it.
In the meantime,

678
00:27:50,786 --> 00:27:52,186
we thought the
police should know

679
00:27:52,188 --> 00:27:53,687
who they're really
dealing with.

680
00:27:53,689 --> 00:27:55,389
<i>I've got to go meet someone</i>

681
00:27:55,391 --> 00:27:56,924
about my other case.

682
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:59,927
You're good to pass all this
along to Marcus? Okay.

683
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:03,030
I must say, I'm surprised you
didn't offer to stay and help.

684
00:28:03,032 --> 00:28:05,265
Mr. Ettinger makes
a compelling case with respect

685
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,067
to Mo Shellshocker's
viability as a suspect.

686
00:28:07,069 --> 00:28:09,002
Mo is a genius.

687
00:28:09,004 --> 00:28:10,637
We're talking off the charts.

688
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:12,139
Leibniz meets Euler meets Gauss.

689
00:28:12,141 --> 00:28:14,108
Huh.
He may have an ego,

690
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,110
but he's not gonna kill
anyone over a few comments.

691
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:18,312
So, while “The League of
Concerned Mathematician”"

692
00:28:18,314 --> 00:28:21,014
chases its tail up there, I
am gonna do the smart thing

693
00:28:21,016 --> 00:28:22,416
and get out of town.

694
00:28:22,418 --> 00:28:24,485
You can let me know
when it all blows over.

695
00:28:24,487 --> 00:28:26,386
You're not going
anywhere, Harlan.

696
00:28:26,388 --> 00:28:29,223
Or should I call you
Mo Shellshocker?

697
00:28:32,728 --> 00:28:34,661
Did you honestly think
I wouldn't recognize

698
00:28:34,663 --> 00:28:36,130
an anagram of my own name?

699
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:40,567
I knew I should've gone
with “Choker Hell Moss”"

700
00:28:40,569 --> 00:28:42,569
But I never thought
that you would see it, okay?

701
00:28:42,571 --> 00:28:44,104
Math is my thing, not yours.

702
00:28:44,106 --> 00:28:46,473
It's my name, Harlan;
that makes it my thing.

703
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,675
It was an homage.

704
00:28:48,677 --> 00:28:50,043
Explain.

705
00:28:50,045 --> 00:28:52,045
Every day, all over the world,

706
00:28:52,047 --> 00:28:54,348
math is used to trick people.

707
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,917
Data dredging to sell
pharmaceuticals.

708
00:28:56,919 --> 00:28:59,720
Publication bias
to justify wars.

709
00:28:59,722 --> 00:29:02,322
In the wrong hands, math can be
manipulated, abused.

710
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:05,425
And I decided to do
something about it.

711
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:09,596
You catch people
who murder other people.

712
00:29:09,598 --> 00:29:11,431
I catch people who murder math.

713
00:29:11,433 --> 00:29:14,568
According to this,
Mo is a wanted man.

714
00:29:17,606 --> 00:29:19,940
Harlan?

715
00:29:19,942 --> 00:29:23,110
The D.O.D. was working
on a new fighter.

716
00:29:23,112 --> 00:29:27,047
Only, I knew that the
performance stats were bogus.

717
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:29,116
A friend of mine found
the internal numbers,

718
00:29:29,118 --> 00:29:31,251
and I sort of published them.

719
00:29:31,253 --> 00:29:33,320
So you put classified
Department of Defense documents

720
00:29:33,322 --> 00:29:34,888
on the Internet.

721
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:36,623
Isn't that what
you would have done?

722
00:29:38,928 --> 00:29:41,562
Fine! I screwed up, okay?

723
00:29:41,564 --> 00:29:43,730
But, hey, that's what I do,
right? I screw up.

724
00:29:43,732 --> 00:29:46,233
If I didn't, then probably you
wouldn't have secretly fired me.

725
00:29:46,235 --> 00:29:47,968
Excuse me?

726
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,403
I know about Indira Patel!

727
00:29:51,006 --> 00:29:53,340
I know you replaced me.

728
00:29:55,144 --> 00:29:58,979
Kitty, I think
we could use some tea.

729
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:04,318
Just tell me.

730
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,253
Tell me what math I got wrong.

731
00:30:06,255 --> 00:30:09,356
Tell me why you didn't let me
make it up to you.

732
00:30:09,358 --> 00:30:12,926
It wasn't the maths, it was you.

733
00:30:14,763 --> 00:30:18,232
Your work was impeccable.

734
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:20,334
And for the most part,
I enjoyed our collaborations.

735
00:30:20,336 --> 00:30:24,838
B-But over time, you just...
you became quite... needy.

736
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,406
What are you talking about?

737
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:29,109
Y-You asked my advice
on-on social matters,

738
00:30:29,111 --> 00:30:32,512
and you even invited me
to a party.

739
00:30:32,514 --> 00:30:34,648
You were my friend.

740
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,416
I was your employer, Harlan.

741
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:37,918
A-And you were my consultant.

742
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,419
One of many.

743
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:43,757
I know that I'm a little
obsessed with what I do.

744
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:46,960
That has always made it hard
to make friends.

745
00:30:46,962 --> 00:30:50,664
And I used to feel pretty bad
about that, and then I met you.

746
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:52,566
And I thought to myself,

747
00:30:52,568 --> 00:30:55,903
hey, if it doesn't bother him,
why should I let it bother me?

748
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:03,810
I got a lot
out of the work that we did.

749
00:31:03,812 --> 00:31:06,146
A lot.

750
00:31:06,148 --> 00:31:11,218
But if someone like you thinks
that I'm a loser, then...

751
00:31:22,564 --> 00:31:24,965
Hey, are we still doing this?

752
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:26,366
Doing what?

753
00:31:26,368 --> 00:31:28,502
Talking about the case.

754
00:31:28,504 --> 00:31:30,070
You're just sitting there.

755
00:31:30,072 --> 00:31:32,105
I'm thinking.

756
00:31:32,107 --> 00:31:34,308
I suspect the silence
is exacerbated

757
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,143
by the nature
of our communication.

758
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:37,811
Yes. Well, I don't
live there anymore.

759
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,713
So, if you want
to talk shop at night,

760
00:31:39,715 --> 00:31:41,515
this is the best I can do.

761
00:31:41,517 --> 00:31:45,252
Keep asking myself:
what did the killer want?

762
00:31:45,254 --> 00:31:48,255
He went to great lengths to lure
brilliant mathematicians

763
00:31:48,257 --> 00:31:49,489
to their deaths.

764
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,525
Winnowed out
the less gifted

765
00:31:51,527 --> 00:31:54,061
by making his problems
more and more complicated.

766
00:31:54,063 --> 00:31:57,597
He had a type, but I still think
he's a serial killer

767
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:59,266
only in the most
technical sense.

768
00:31:59,268 --> 00:32:01,201
He tortured both his victims.

769
00:32:01,203 --> 00:32:02,936
But there's no sign
that he enjoyed it.

770
00:32:02,938 --> 00:32:04,538
The work was
utilitarian,

771
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,740
suggesting it was
less for pleasure

772
00:32:06,742 --> 00:32:10,043
and more for persuasion.

773
00:32:10,045 --> 00:32:11,945
He wanted something.

774
00:32:11,947 --> 00:32:13,714
But what?

775
00:32:13,716 --> 00:32:16,483
Maybe there's a connection
between Wallaczek and Lowenthal

776
00:32:16,485 --> 00:32:18,418
we haven't spotted yet.

777
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,220
Maybe they were working
on a project together,

778
00:32:20,222 --> 00:32:21,822
something that was worth
a lot of money.

779
00:32:21,824 --> 00:32:23,857
There's no way the killer
could have predicted

780
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:26,093
which competitors would make it
to the terminal stage.

781
00:32:26,095 --> 00:32:28,795
That part of the game
was beyond his control.

782
00:32:28,797 --> 00:32:30,664
If it weren't,
he would've been prepared

783
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:33,300
to dispose of a body
the size of Ike Wallaczek's.

784
00:32:33,302 --> 00:32:35,335
So, even if there were a
connection between the victims,

785
00:32:35,337 --> 00:32:37,070
the killer could not
have counted on them

786
00:32:37,072 --> 00:32:38,839
being lured into his trap.

787
00:32:38,841 --> 00:32:41,041
Certainly not
in sequence.

788
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:45,112
His game was, in many respects,
one of chance.

789
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:51,718
Suggesting he knows what
he wants, but not who has it.

790
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,888
Like he was on a puzzle hunt
of his own.

791
00:32:56,825 --> 00:32:58,859
I'm back.

792
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:05,665
I'll set up
downstairs, yeah?

793
00:33:09,138 --> 00:33:11,238
I've been thinking about
what you said earlier.

794
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,740
I've decided to engage her
one more time

795
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:15,609
with regards
to her recuperation.

796
00:33:17,112 --> 00:33:21,815
I doubt she'll listen,
but I'll keep you apprised.

797
00:33:25,954 --> 00:33:27,421
I've been thinking.

798
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:29,623
About?
You. Your history.

799
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:31,825
Your decision
not to seek help.

800
00:33:31,827 --> 00:33:34,594
I think it's
a mistake.

801
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,530
Oh?

802
00:33:36,532 --> 00:33:38,198
I've looked into a number
of support groups.

803
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,633
As you are well aware,

804
00:33:39,635 --> 00:33:41,701
I have benefited greatly
from similar settings.

805
00:33:41,703 --> 00:33:43,270
You have.

806
00:33:43,272 --> 00:33:44,638
The process, I find,

807
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,906
is not unlike
voiding one's bowels...

808
00:33:45,908 --> 00:33:47,808
I'll go.
What?

809
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:49,676
I'll go.
Just get me the details.

810
00:33:52,014 --> 00:33:55,182
I've been thinking, too-- about
your number-cruncher, Harlan.

811
00:33:55,184 --> 00:33:57,017
You think I was
too hard on him.

812
00:33:57,019 --> 00:33:58,685
You will have consultants
of your own one day.

813
00:33:58,687 --> 00:34:01,488
You'll see that they require
management and focus.

814
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:04,124
They are but keys on a keyboard,
and we're the typists.

815
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:06,159
You could've given him
a shoeing for all I care.

816
00:34:06,161 --> 00:34:07,828
No, I'm just saying that

817
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:10,030
some of the stuff he's got
up to, it's quite good.

818
00:34:10,032 --> 00:34:11,698
You should take a look.

819
00:34:13,368 --> 00:34:15,735
You may find a fellow typist.

820
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,076
Hello?

821
00:34:23,078 --> 00:34:25,312
Yeah, I
hear that you and some friends

822
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:27,848
are trying to identify
Mo Shellshocker.

823
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,649
That's right. Who is this?

824
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:32,719
His name is Harlan Emple.

825
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:34,020
You got a pen?

826
00:34:34,022 --> 00:34:36,456
I'll-I'll give you his address.

827
00:34:52,454 --> 00:34:54,020
Harlan.

828
00:34:54,022 --> 00:34:56,356
You can't take a hint, can you?

829
00:34:56,358 --> 00:34:57,657
I got your text messages.

830
00:34:57,659 --> 00:34:58,958
I don't want to see you
right now.

831
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,827
So if you came here
to apologize...

832
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:03,363
Actually, I came here
to spare you an agonizing death.

833
00:35:04,299 --> 00:35:05,832
Can I come in?

834
00:35:05,834 --> 00:35:08,301
I was puzzling earlier

835
00:35:08,303 --> 00:35:12,038
as to why the killer went
to such specific lengths.

836
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,606
What did he want?

837
00:35:13,608 --> 00:35:15,809
And then Watson,
quite by accident,

838
00:35:15,811 --> 00:35:17,410
she made a most
compelling analogy.

839
00:35:17,412 --> 00:35:20,080
She said it was as if he
was on a hunt of his own.

840
00:35:20,082 --> 00:35:22,615
Duh. He was hunting
mathematicians.

841
00:35:22,617 --> 00:35:23,783
No, he wasn't.

842
00:35:23,785 --> 00:35:25,151
He was hunting<i> a</i> mathematician.

843
00:35:25,153 --> 00:35:26,619
One.

844
00:35:26,621 --> 00:35:29,389
A man who had concealed
his identity not only

845
00:35:29,391 --> 00:35:31,191
from the mathematics
community at large,

846
00:35:31,193 --> 00:35:32,859
but also from the FBI.

847
00:35:32,861 --> 00:35:35,395
A “crusader,”
you might call him.

848
00:35:35,397 --> 00:35:36,763
Wait a minute.

849
00:35:36,765 --> 00:35:38,731
Are you saying that
this was all about me?

850
00:35:53,448 --> 00:35:56,449
<i> Unfortunately, emulating</i>
<i>the work of people like me</i>

851
00:35:56,451 --> 00:35:59,018
<i>is not without risks.</i>

852
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,320
Creates enemies.

853
00:36:00,322 --> 00:36:02,889
I knew it was the government.

854
00:36:02,891 --> 00:36:04,424
It was a lottery winner.

855
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,260
Little over a year ago,

856
00:36:07,262 --> 00:36:09,529
you started a series of blogs
where you exposed the flaws

857
00:36:09,531 --> 00:36:11,664
in certain scratch card
lottery games.

858
00:36:11,666 --> 00:36:13,766
Tickets like this one.

859
00:36:13,768 --> 00:36:15,802
I wrote about
baited hook games.

860
00:36:15,804 --> 00:36:17,971
Games where the numbers
are printed on the front.

861
00:36:17,973 --> 00:36:20,707
Scratch off the hidden numbers,
hope for a match.

862
00:36:20,709 --> 00:36:23,309
Only, you proved that with
careful mathematical analysis

863
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:25,512
of the visible numbers,
you could predict

864
00:36:25,514 --> 00:36:28,381
which tickets were winners
80% of the time.

865
00:36:28,383 --> 00:36:29,682
If you had exploited

866
00:36:29,684 --> 00:36:32,085
this flaw,
rather than exposing it,

867
00:36:32,087 --> 00:36:33,520
you could have made millions.

868
00:36:33,522 --> 00:36:36,022
Well... sure.
But that would been cheating.

869
00:36:36,024 --> 00:36:37,157
Right.

870
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:38,825
So imagine
for a moment

871
00:36:38,827 --> 00:36:41,060
that you are a less
honest mathematician.

872
00:36:41,062 --> 00:36:42,495
Right?

873
00:36:42,497 --> 00:36:44,063
You've been taking
advantage of these games

874
00:36:44,065 --> 00:36:47,967
for a couple of years to
amass a small fortune.

875
00:36:47,969 --> 00:36:49,502
And then “Mo"
comes along.

876
00:36:49,504 --> 00:36:51,971
He starts exposing
the broken games.

877
00:36:51,973 --> 00:36:54,340
State lottery commissions
shut them down.

878
00:36:54,342 --> 00:36:56,976
The exploitable
games dry up.

879
00:36:56,978 --> 00:37:00,613
Now, if you were a
psychopathic lottery cheat,

880
00:37:00,615 --> 00:37:02,582
how do you fix that?

881
00:37:02,584 --> 00:37:04,484
You kill Mo.

882
00:37:04,486 --> 00:37:07,253
<i>Unfortunately, Mo is elusive.</i>

883
00:37:07,255 --> 00:37:08,821
<i>Anonymous.</i>

884
00:37:08,823 --> 00:37:11,224
The only thing
he knew about him for sure

885
00:37:11,226 --> 00:37:14,394
was that he could not resist
a puzzle hunt.

886
00:37:14,396 --> 00:37:17,130
Now, if you were smart enough
to identify

887
00:37:17,132 --> 00:37:19,399
and take advantage of
broken lottery games...

888
00:37:19,401 --> 00:37:21,868
Then I'm smart enough
to design a puzzle hunt.

889
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:25,338
This plan was not
without its flaws.

890
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:28,775
Once a competitor
reached the terminal stage,

891
00:37:28,777 --> 00:37:32,745
the killer could not be certain
that he'd trapped Mo, could he?

892
00:37:32,747 --> 00:37:34,480
So he tortured them.

893
00:37:34,482 --> 00:37:37,083
I submit he forced them to
log on to Mo's Web site,

894
00:37:37,085 --> 00:37:39,686
and when they failed...

895
00:37:41,323 --> 00:37:42,755
After two murders,

896
00:37:42,757 --> 00:37:44,290
the game was compromised.

897
00:37:44,292 --> 00:37:46,192
So the killer devises
a Plan “B.”

898
00:37:46,194 --> 00:37:47,460
He tricks

899
00:37:47,462 --> 00:37:49,229
a group of his peers

900
00:37:49,231 --> 00:37:51,097
into helping search
for an alternative means

901
00:37:51,099 --> 00:37:53,032
of identifying Mo.

902
00:37:56,504 --> 00:37:58,438
You're talking about that guy.

903
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,906
The one with the penthouse.

904
00:37:59,908 --> 00:38:02,742
<i>Paul?</i>

905
00:38:02,744 --> 00:38:05,044
Lottery winners
are public record.

906
00:38:05,046 --> 00:38:07,814
So when I searched for
the names of repeat winners

907
00:38:07,816 --> 00:38:09,482
in the dates prior
to your posts...

908
00:38:09,484 --> 00:38:11,317
I can't believe
I drank his water.

909
00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:12,685
I called him.

910
00:38:12,687 --> 00:38:14,654
I identified you as Mo.

911
00:38:14,656 --> 00:38:16,122
And I gave him your address.

912
00:38:16,124 --> 00:38:17,590
You what?!

913
00:38:21,129 --> 00:38:23,062
Drop your weapon!

914
00:38:23,064 --> 00:38:24,597
<i>I did not, however, give him</i>

915
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:25,965
<i>the correct apartment number.</i>

916
00:38:25,967 --> 00:38:28,334
He was arrested
a little over an hour ago.

917
00:38:30,739 --> 00:38:31,871
Tried to call you to
tell you, but, um...

918
00:38:31,873 --> 00:38:33,539
But I was ignoring you.

919
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:35,008
Yes, you were ignoring me.

920
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,209
Look, you know

921
00:38:36,211 --> 00:38:37,377
that I'm still screwed, right?

922
00:38:37,379 --> 00:38:39,279
You told him that I'm Mo.

923
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:42,115
He's gonna tell the police,
they're gonna tell the FBI...

924
00:38:42,117 --> 00:38:43,516
The NYPD is under
the impression

925
00:38:43,518 --> 00:38:45,385
that I lied about
your connection to Mo

926
00:38:45,387 --> 00:38:47,920
in order to draw
Mr. Ettinger out.

927
00:38:47,922 --> 00:38:49,555
As far as the
FBI goes, well,

928
00:38:49,557 --> 00:38:51,958
I've got some associates
who have created a trail

929
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,860
which will
strongly suggest that Mo

930
00:38:53,862 --> 00:38:55,728
is a cyber-terrorist
I became aware of

931
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:58,197
whilst working for, um...

932
00:38:58,199 --> 00:38:59,766
queen and country.

933
00:38:59,768 --> 00:39:02,135
Your secret's
quite safe.

934
00:39:02,137 --> 00:39:03,903
Thanks.

935
00:39:06,508 --> 00:39:09,776
My reasons for preserving you
are entirely selfish, Harlan.

936
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:13,279
You are a tremendous asset.

937
00:39:13,281 --> 00:39:15,815
I have little doubt

938
00:39:15,817 --> 00:39:19,118
I will need your help again
in the future.

939
00:39:26,461 --> 00:39:28,528
Me or him?

940
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:29,996
You.

941
00:39:29,998 --> 00:39:31,798
I have an update on
that real estate flipper.

942
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,433
I thought you might
want to know.

943
00:39:39,274 --> 00:39:41,908
I tracked down the truck rental
receipts to get her name.

944
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,142
Valerie Cork.

945
00:39:43,144 --> 00:39:44,911
She's an art authenticator.

946
00:39:44,913 --> 00:39:46,779
And that crate you saw?

947
00:39:46,781 --> 00:39:48,414
There was
something called

948
00:39:48,416 --> 00:39:50,683
a scanning fluorescence
spectrometry machine inside.

949
00:39:50,685 --> 00:39:52,251
They're used...
To find paintings

950
00:39:52,253 --> 00:39:53,553
underneath other paintings.

951
00:39:53,555 --> 00:39:55,288
So it turns out
that the building

952
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:56,689
Chad Keswick was looking to buy

953
00:39:56,691 --> 00:39:59,025
was leased by the WPA
during the Depression.

954
00:39:59,027 --> 00:40:00,927
They commissioned a
mural for the lobby.

955
00:40:00,929 --> 00:40:03,329
The artist was a
notorious communist,

956
00:40:03,331 --> 00:40:05,365
so when the property passed
into private hands in the '50s,

957
00:40:05,367 --> 00:40:06,999
the new owners
had it painted over.

958
00:40:07,001 --> 00:40:08,735
But it was still there,
under the paint.

959
00:40:08,737 --> 00:40:11,037
A lost work by Diego Rivera.

960
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:13,473
It's worth ten times
the price of the building.

961
00:40:14,676 --> 00:40:17,043
I was hoping to leak
the truth to the<i> Times.</i>

962
00:40:18,113 --> 00:40:20,046
I promised you a cut of my fee.

963
00:40:20,048 --> 00:40:22,148
But I'm pretty sure
the mural's gonna end up

964
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:24,384
in the hands of
a historical trust.

965
00:40:24,386 --> 00:40:26,352
I'd feel obligated
to refund my client,

966
00:40:26,354 --> 00:40:28,388
which means you'd get
a cut of nothing.

967
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:31,457
That works for me.

968
00:40:31,459 --> 00:40:33,493
Okay.

969
00:40:35,463 --> 00:40:37,397
I think you should know

970
00:40:37,399 --> 00:40:39,732
that I am going
to a meeting tonight.

971
00:40:41,803 --> 00:40:45,505
One of those
support groups for...

972
00:40:45,507 --> 00:40:47,340
people like me.

973
00:40:47,342 --> 00:40:49,876
It was, uh, Sherlock's idea.

974
00:40:49,878 --> 00:40:51,644
That's great.

975
00:40:51,646 --> 00:40:53,446
I know you put him up to it.

976
00:40:53,448 --> 00:40:55,381
We talked.

977
00:40:57,552 --> 00:41:00,219
When he first approached me
in London,

978
00:41:00,221 --> 00:41:03,556
I was...

979
00:41:03,558 --> 00:41:05,558
in a bad way.

980
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,227
And I had been for a while.

981
00:41:08,229 --> 00:41:11,130
But then,
when he talked about

982
00:41:11,132 --> 00:41:12,365
the work that he did,

983
00:41:12,367 --> 00:41:16,035
about the things
that he saw in me...

984
00:41:18,406 --> 00:41:19,739
I want it.

985
00:41:19,741 --> 00:41:21,874
I want every bit
of what's he offered me,

986
00:41:21,876 --> 00:41:23,843
of what he offered you, but...

987
00:41:23,845 --> 00:41:26,212
if I've learned one thing
over the last few weeks,

988
00:41:26,214 --> 00:41:28,047
it's that he can't pull it off.

989
00:41:28,049 --> 00:41:29,682
Not by himself, anyway.

990
00:41:31,586 --> 00:41:34,153
And if I'm gonna get
what I want,

991
00:41:34,155 --> 00:41:37,690
then I'm going to need
your help, too.

992
00:41:40,361 --> 00:41:42,829
I still think
the meetings are bollocks,

993
00:41:42,831 --> 00:41:44,931
but you say they're important.

994
00:41:44,933 --> 00:41:47,967
They matter to you, so...

995
00:41:47,969 --> 00:41:49,735
What do you say, Watson?

996
00:41:49,737 --> 00:41:52,071
Will you help me?

997
00:41:56,277 --> 00:41:58,244
I don't know how it happened.

998
00:41:58,246 --> 00:42:01,547
It just... hit me.

999
00:42:01,549 --> 00:42:03,983
Like a truck, out of nowhere.

1000
00:42:04,853 --> 00:42:07,753
Work is good.

1001
00:42:07,755 --> 00:42:09,755
I have friends.

1002
00:42:09,757 --> 00:42:13,092
I'm in a
relationship.

1003
00:42:13,094 --> 00:42:16,896
Somewhere along
the way, somehow,

1004
00:42:16,898 --> 00:42:19,732
I stopped being a victim

1005
00:42:19,734 --> 00:42:22,602
and became a survivor.

1006
00:42:22,604 --> 00:42:25,705
So, I guess all I'm saying is,
there's hope.

1007
00:42:26,357 --> 00:42:31,686
Do the work. Love yourself.
There's hope.

<i>Previously on</i> Elementary...

2
00:00:03,422 --> 00:00:04,761
If you're looking for Sherlock,
he's downstairs.

3
00:00:04,785 --> 00:00:05,841
Okay.

4
00:00:05,842 --> 00:00:07,541
<i>His name is Harlan Emple.</i>

5
00:00:07,543 --> 00:00:09,176
<i>He is the Rachel P. Hanson</i>
<i>Professor</i>

6

for Applied Mathematics
at Columbia University.

7
00:00:11,301 --> 00:00:14,502
What I don't get is
why he isn't wearing a shirt.

8
00:00:14,504 --> 00:00:17,372
He doesn't like anything to come
between him and the numbers.

9
00:00:17,374 --> 00:00:18,415
What is it?

10
00:00:18,438 --> 00:00:20,274
The answers to your questions
about Kitty.

11
00:00:20,276 --> 00:00:22,710
The truth is she was a
victim of a horrific crime.

12
00:00:22,712 --> 00:00:24,646
<i>After you left last night,</i>

13
00:00:24,648 --> 00:00:26,848
Sherlock gave me an envelope.

14
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,249
Sherlock keeps saying

15
00:00:28,251 --> 00:00:30,385
that I need to get
a better sense of you,

16
00:00:30,387 --> 00:00:33,021
and maybe that will give you
a better sense of me.

17
00:00:42,065 --> 00:00:43,065
It's open.

18
00:00:47,637 --> 00:00:49,003
It's nothing.

19
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:50,872
It's Sherlock and
one of his experts.

20
00:00:50,874 --> 00:00:52,006
Which one?

21
00:00:52,008 --> 00:00:53,241
Phillip something.

22
00:00:53,243 --> 00:00:54,575
Must be new.

23
00:00:54,577 --> 00:00:57,445
He's a knife-thrower.

24
00:00:57,447 --> 00:00:58,913
Why does Sherlock have
a knife-thrower?

25
00:00:58,915 --> 00:01:00,748
He got bored the other day,

26
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,185
started looking into this, uh,
circus accident from the '30s.

27
00:01:04,187 --> 00:01:07,922
The Great Galardo perforated one
of his assistants during an act,

28
00:01:07,924 --> 00:01:09,924
except Sherlock thinks
the blade was thrown

29
00:01:09,926 --> 00:01:11,492
by somebody in the stands,
not Galardo.

30
00:01:11,494 --> 00:01:15,096
Phillip, as far as I
can tell, disagrees.

31
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:18,900
It can't be done, okay?

32
00:01:18,902 --> 00:01:19,934
It was done.

33
00:01:19,936 --> 00:01:21,335
You're wrong.

34
00:01:21,337 --> 00:01:23,538
Nobody can chuck
a knife that far.

35
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,239
What's this?

36
00:01:25,241 --> 00:01:26,207
You're...

37
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:27,209
Not here.

38
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,509
I'm not here.

39
00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:29,711
Remember that, okay?

40
00:01:29,713 --> 00:01:31,279
Oh, yes. Heaven
forfend your work

41
00:01:31,281 --> 00:01:33,247
with me should endanger
your precious day job.

42
00:01:33,249 --> 00:01:35,116
You throw knives?

43
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,252
You know, it was supposed
to be just you here.

44
00:01:38,254 --> 00:01:41,355
Phillip is arguably the greatest
knife-thrower in the world.

45
00:01:41,357 --> 00:01:42,790
Has been for decades.

46
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:43,925
Only, there's little money

47
00:01:43,927 --> 00:01:45,193
to be made
in the impalement arts.

48
00:01:45,195 --> 00:01:46,494
So, as a youth, he turned

49
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,563
to what you Americans
term “football”"

50
00:01:48,565 --> 00:01:50,131
Is this a joke?

51
00:01:53,837 --> 00:01:55,002
Phillip, head
and heart.

52
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:56,904
Come on.
Head and heart.

53
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:06,814
Can I go?

54
00:02:06,816 --> 00:02:09,484
Yeah.

55
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,489
15 years he spent throwing
that misshapen ball around.

56
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:16,057
15 years.

57
00:02:16,059 --> 00:02:18,259
When I think of the acclaim
he could have brought

58
00:02:18,261 --> 00:02:20,828
to competitive blade slinging.

59
00:02:27,237 --> 00:02:29,036
You're following me,
Watson.

60
00:02:29,038 --> 00:02:30,338
I don't like it.

61
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,740
I want you to help
me with something.

62
00:02:32,742 --> 00:02:33,908
This is Chad Keswick.

63
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,976
He buys distressed
buildings,

64
00:02:34,978 --> 00:02:36,210
paints, spackles,

65
00:02:36,212 --> 00:02:37,645
and then flips them
for quick money.

66
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:39,180
Who'd he kill?
No one.

67
00:02:39,182 --> 00:02:41,315
I was hired by one of
his rivals to find out

68
00:02:41,317 --> 00:02:43,017
why he's been circling
this old office building

69
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:44,218
in Jamaica, Queens.

70
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,586
She wants to know
why he thinks

71
00:02:45,588 --> 00:02:47,355
the building is
a good investment.

72
00:02:47,357 --> 00:02:49,590
Is there a crime in there,
something worth investigating?

73
00:02:49,592 --> 00:02:50,925
Well, I've been
shadowing Keswick,

74
00:02:50,927 --> 00:02:52,593
but yesterday I think
he noticed me.

75
00:02:52,595 --> 00:02:54,595
I want to switch
up the tail.

76
00:02:54,597 --> 00:02:57,231
You followed me for over
a week before I noticed you.

77
00:02:57,233 --> 00:02:59,033
Help me out, and I'll
cut you in on my fee.

78
00:02:59,035 --> 00:03:02,003
I don't work for you,
I work for Sherlock.

79
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:03,437
I worked for him, too.

80
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,773
And, in my experience,
he was always supportive

81
00:03:05,775 --> 00:03:07,942
of taking on work
outside the partnership.

82
00:03:07,944 --> 00:03:10,912
Sorry, it's not my cup of tea.

83
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:33,034
Hello, Portal Ten.

84
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,247
I'm here, Belphegor.

85
00:03:46,249 --> 00:03:49,784
So where is the next clue?

Yeah, you called it
a puzzle hunt.

91
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,491
Belphegor's Prime.

92
00:04:50,761 --> 00:04:53,262
Think Cicada 3301
or Octorine's Challenge.

93
00:04:54,365 --> 00:04:55,631
They're math games.

94
00:04:55,633 --> 00:04:56,865
Math-- maybe you've heard of it.

95
00:04:56,867 --> 00:04:58,333
I've got some math for you.

96
00:04:58,335 --> 00:05:00,335
One dead guy
plus one live guy

97
00:05:00,337 --> 00:05:02,104
found in the same
deserted factory.

98
00:05:02,106 --> 00:05:06,108
I was not “found” there;
I am the one who called 911.

99
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,310
I was waiting there
for the police.

100
00:05:08,312 --> 00:05:09,745
Mr. Emple,

101
00:05:09,747 --> 00:05:11,613
we're just trying
to do our jobs, all right?

102
00:05:11,615 --> 00:05:13,048
First officers
on the scene described you

103
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,516
as “extremely agitated.”

104
00:05:14,518 --> 00:05:15,984
Well, of course
I was agitated.

105
00:05:15,986 --> 00:05:18,754
I had just found
a dead guy in mothballs!

106
00:05:18,756 --> 00:05:21,790
And did I mention that I have
not slept in almost two days?

107
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:23,358
Because of the math game.

108
00:05:24,762 --> 00:05:26,195
Can I borrow those?

109
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:31,100
This...

110
00:05:31,102 --> 00:05:33,302
is Belphegor's Prime, okay?

111
00:05:33,304 --> 00:05:35,304
It's a numeric palindrome.

112
00:05:35,306 --> 00:05:40,776
It's 666 bookended by 13 zeroes
and then bracketed with ones.

113
00:05:40,778 --> 00:05:43,846
Named for the demon Belphegor
who was a prince of hell.

114
00:05:43,848 --> 00:05:46,448
The first clue for the hunt
started making the rounds

115
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,883
a few months ago.

116
00:05:47,885 --> 00:05:49,651
It was a JPEG with two numbers
hidden in it.

117
00:05:49,653 --> 00:05:51,453
You divide those numbers
by Belphegor's Prime,

118
00:05:51,455 --> 00:05:54,890
and you get the GPS coordinates
for a restroom at the Bronx Zoo.

119
00:05:54,892 --> 00:05:56,959
You go to the restroom,
you find a phone number.

120
00:05:56,961 --> 00:05:58,927
You send a text to the number,
you get the next clue.

121
00:05:58,929 --> 00:05:59,962
Which is another math problem.

122
00:05:59,964 --> 00:06:00,929
Exactly.

123
00:06:00,931 --> 00:06:02,397
Only, this one is harder.

124
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,099
And that's how it works.

125
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:05,934
You know, but for
each one that you solve,

126
00:06:05,936 --> 00:06:08,103
you get a new set
of GPS coordinates.

127
00:06:08,105 --> 00:06:11,473
And that means that you've
completed a stage, or a portal.

128
00:06:11,475 --> 00:06:13,509
And last night,
I was on Portal Ten.

129
00:06:13,511 --> 00:06:15,711
And...

130
00:06:17,014 --> 00:06:18,313
You know what?

131
00:06:18,315 --> 00:06:20,015
I want to talk
to Sherlock and Joan.

132
00:06:20,017 --> 00:06:21,917
Look, Mr. Emple...
No, I'm sorry.

133
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,019
I told the police down
at the factory that I know them.

134
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:25,287
Isn't that the whole reason

135
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:26,922
that I was brought here
to this squad?

136
00:06:26,924 --> 00:06:30,392
I-I am not saying another word
until they are here.

137
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:35,264
Harlan Emple is
indeed an acquaintance.

138
00:06:35,266 --> 00:06:37,733
He is, in point of fact,
one of my “irregulars.”

139
00:06:37,735 --> 00:06:38,801
One of your what?

140
00:06:38,803 --> 00:06:40,302
Irregulars.

141
00:06:40,304 --> 00:06:41,770
I'm your consultant, Captain;
they are mine.

142
00:06:41,772 --> 00:06:43,572
They're a handful
of experts I turn to

143
00:06:43,574 --> 00:06:46,108
when I encounter problems which
are beyond my pool of knowledge.

144
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,810
Harlan is
a brilliant mathematician.

145
00:06:47,812 --> 00:06:49,778
And on the handful of occasions
I have tackled a case

146
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,046
which pertained
to mathematics...

147
00:06:51,048 --> 00:06:53,182
He helped you out.
Well, the good news

148
00:06:53,184 --> 00:06:56,018
for him is the preliminary
autopsy report just came in

149
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,252
before you got here.

150
00:06:57,254 --> 00:06:59,021
And the M.E. puts
the time of death

151
00:06:59,023 --> 00:07:00,989
between 4:00 and
6:00 p.m. last night.

152
00:07:00,991 --> 00:07:02,124
Mr. Emple was teaching

153
00:07:02,126 --> 00:07:03,358
a class at Columbia.

154
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,394
So the victim is
yet to be identified?

155
00:07:05,396 --> 00:07:07,663
No I.D., no phone.

156
00:07:07,665 --> 00:07:09,865
First detective on the scene
liked it for a mob hit,

157
00:07:09,867 --> 00:07:11,500
so while we're
running the prints,

158
00:07:11,502 --> 00:07:13,602
he's showing the vic's
face around OCID.

159
00:07:13,604 --> 00:07:16,839
Marcus here was about to walk
the scene with Mr. Emple.

160
00:07:16,841 --> 00:07:18,774
You're here now;
you might as well tag along.

161
00:07:18,776 --> 00:07:21,009
Actually, Captain,
I'm quite busy today.

162
00:07:21,011 --> 00:07:22,978
This is a John Doe,
and we got nothing.

163
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,247
And, like you just said,
you're my consultant.

164
00:07:25,249 --> 00:07:26,748
So, go consult.

165
00:07:29,787 --> 00:07:30,986
Watson.

166
00:07:30,988 --> 00:07:32,588
Um, he's your friend.

167
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,523
Actually, Kitty is
otherwise engaged,

168
00:07:34,525 --> 00:07:37,426
and he did actually help both
of us with a case last year.

169
00:07:37,428 --> 00:07:38,493
Did he not?

170
00:07:40,865 --> 00:07:44,099
Have I told you
how good it is to see you?

171
00:07:44,101 --> 00:07:45,367
Yes, you have.
Three times.

172
00:07:45,369 --> 00:07:46,468
Well, it is.

173
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,636
Hey, lousy circumstances.

174
00:07:47,638 --> 00:07:49,371
But, uh, hey...

175
00:07:49,373 --> 00:07:51,740
I heard from your boss that you
just, uh, got back from London.

176
00:07:51,742 --> 00:07:53,308
Were you working
a case or...?

177
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,576
No, I moved back there.

178
00:07:54,578 --> 00:07:55,677
You mean<i> moved,</i> moved?

179
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:56,845
Is there another
definition?

180
00:07:56,847 --> 00:07:58,513
I was there for
eight months,

181
00:07:58,515 --> 00:08:00,883
and had a change of heart
and returned to New York.

182
00:08:00,885 --> 00:08:02,517
So, you moved to London,
and you didn't, uh...

183
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,086
You know what?
Doesn't even matter.

184
00:08:04,088 --> 00:08:05,387
The point is you're back!

185
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:07,389
Mr. Emple.
Uh, duty calls.

186
00:08:07,391 --> 00:08:09,024
Yeah.

187
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:18,634
It's interesting.

188
00:08:18,636 --> 00:08:20,068
Mothballs are interesting?

189
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,070
They were taken from
that cabinet over there.

190
00:08:22,072 --> 00:08:25,941
Obviously, to cover the smell
of John Doe's decay.

191
00:08:25,943 --> 00:08:28,043
The killer didn't
bring them with him.

192
00:08:28,045 --> 00:08:31,179
Perhaps leaving the body here
was not part of his plan, hmm?

193
00:08:32,983 --> 00:08:36,018
Doe was shot in the foot
first and then the knee.

194
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,453
Either those were
two really bad misses or...

195
00:08:38,455 --> 00:08:41,256
Or the killer was torturing him.

196
00:08:41,258 --> 00:08:43,892
This doesn't seem like anything
you can't handle on your own.

197
00:08:43,894 --> 00:08:45,994
So you want to tell me why you
really asked me to come here?

198
00:08:45,996 --> 00:08:48,363
“This doesn't seem like anything
you can't handle on your own.”

199
00:08:48,365 --> 00:08:49,765
That's funny.

200
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:51,566
That's exactly what
I would have said

201
00:08:51,568 --> 00:08:53,602
had I been present when you
asked Kitty for her assistance

202
00:08:53,604 --> 00:08:54,937
with your tawdry side job.

203
00:08:54,939 --> 00:08:57,372
“Tawdry”?
I wanted you to know I approve.

204
00:08:57,374 --> 00:08:59,007
Of what?

205
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:01,376
Your agenda
with regards to Kitty.

206
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:03,078
Several days ago,
I gave you her file.

207
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,913
And then you show up at
the brownstone yesterday,

208
00:09:04,915 --> 00:09:06,515
and you invite her
into an investigation.

209
00:09:06,517 --> 00:09:08,183
Coincidence? No, I think not.

210
00:09:08,185 --> 00:09:11,320
You feel for her.
And now you wish to engage.

211
00:09:11,322 --> 00:09:13,956
It's not an outcome
I would have predicted, no.

212
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,458
But it is one
I approve of, yeah.

213
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,193
She could learn
a great deal from you,

214
00:09:18,195 --> 00:09:20,228
especially with regards
to how to get the most

215
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,864
from my tutelage.

216
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:25,734
So, I've already dispatched her
to, uh, follow your Mr. Keswick.

217
00:09:25,736 --> 00:09:27,836
But that's not
what I actually...

218
00:09:27,838 --> 00:09:29,404
Harlan!

219
00:09:30,741 --> 00:09:33,075
You came here to retrieve
a phone number, did you not?

220
00:09:33,077 --> 00:09:34,609
You would send a text,
and then receive

221
00:09:34,611 --> 00:09:36,845
the next clue in the game
that you were playing.

222
00:09:36,847 --> 00:09:38,747
Yeah, but I didn't find it.

223
00:09:38,749 --> 00:09:40,048
Not that I kept looking

224
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,250
after the dead guy
fell out of the locker.

225
00:09:42,252 --> 00:09:44,052
Yeah, CSU didn't find
any number either.

226
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:46,154
Probably because
it's under that paint.

227
00:09:46,156 --> 00:09:48,190
It's fresh.

228
00:09:48,192 --> 00:09:49,891
Applied in the last

229
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:52,694
24 hours.

230
00:09:52,696 --> 00:09:54,696
Right after John Doe's murder,
I'd wager.

231
00:09:54,698 --> 00:09:57,099
You don't think
this was a mob hit?

232
00:09:57,101 --> 00:09:59,101
Doe and the killer were
playing the game, too.

233
00:09:59,103 --> 00:10:01,203
The killer shot Doe and
then covered up the number

234
00:10:01,205 --> 00:10:02,704
so no one else could use it.

235
00:10:02,706 --> 00:10:04,806
What's the prize
in your little contest?

236
00:10:04,808 --> 00:10:07,576
Well, I'm doing it
mostly for the math.

237
00:10:07,578 --> 00:10:11,480
But, uh, $1,707,071.

238
00:10:11,482 --> 00:10:13,882
It's another
palindromic prime.

239
00:10:13,884 --> 00:10:17,152
Did I not mention the
money at the station?

240
00:10:17,154 --> 00:10:18,587
Who the hell can afford

241
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:20,655
that kind of payout
for a puzzle hunt?

242
00:10:20,657 --> 00:10:22,124
Well, most people
think it's CAML.

243
00:10:22,126 --> 00:10:24,593
The Center for Applied
Mathematics and Logic.

244
00:10:24,595 --> 00:10:26,094
It's located
in Ramapo...

245
00:10:26,096 --> 00:10:27,729
Wait, most people
“think” it's them?

246
00:10:27,731 --> 00:10:29,331
Well, hunts like these,

247
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,266
the organizers are
almost always anonymous.

248
00:10:31,268 --> 00:10:32,401
It's S.O.P.

249
00:10:32,403 --> 00:10:34,302
What about the
contestants?

250
00:10:34,304 --> 00:10:37,005
Is anonymity
also S.O.P.?

251
00:10:37,007 --> 00:10:39,207
For the most part, yeah.

252
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:43,078
But, guys, math peeps
are my peeps, okay?

253
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,314
It's, uh, like
a community, sort of.

254
00:10:46,316 --> 00:10:48,984
I can think of ten
or 12 other people

255
00:10:48,986 --> 00:10:50,018
who were probably competing.

256
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,186
Would that help?

257
00:10:53,157 --> 00:10:55,223
No.

258
00:10:55,225 --> 00:10:58,026
I'm sorry, I don't know him.

259
00:10:58,028 --> 00:11:00,862
But you admit you were
competing in Belphegor's Prime.

260
00:11:00,864 --> 00:11:02,197
I do.

261
00:11:04,835 --> 00:11:05,934
Pepe!

262
00:11:08,172 --> 00:11:10,439
Sorry. He doesn't
like strangers.

263
00:11:12,109 --> 00:11:14,443
Give him one of these.

264
00:11:14,445 --> 00:11:16,111
Get on his good side.

265
00:11:24,288 --> 00:11:26,354
What are you doing?

266
00:11:28,225 --> 00:11:30,725
I'm just verifying that
you've been lying to us.

267
00:11:30,727 --> 00:11:33,895
You did know the
dead man, did you not?

268
00:11:33,897 --> 00:11:36,998
I reviewed his personal
effects at the morgue earlier.

269
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,034
The coroner reported finding
crumbs in one of his pockets.

270
00:11:39,036 --> 00:11:40,036
I tasted one.

271
00:11:40,037 --> 00:11:41,269
Why would you...?

272
00:11:41,271 --> 00:11:42,771
At first, I thought
they were from

273
00:11:42,773 --> 00:11:44,439
a particularly rancid
brand of cheese,

274
00:11:44,441 --> 00:11:47,609
but, no... they're from
one of Pepe's treats.

275
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:49,277
Homemade?

276
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,481
Harlan was able to give us
the names of nine other people

277
00:11:52,483 --> 00:11:54,149
he believed to be
other competitors.

278
00:11:54,151 --> 00:11:55,984
Our colleagues are
investigating them as we speak,

279
00:11:55,986 --> 00:11:57,919
but I'll quite happily
recommend that the NYPD

280
00:11:57,921 --> 00:12:00,222
focus its attention
entirely on you.

281
00:12:04,128 --> 00:12:06,428
His name was Ike Walaczek.

282
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,231
In another lifetime,
he was my boyfriend.

283
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:10,866
And what of
this lifetime?

284
00:12:10,868 --> 00:12:12,701
We were working together.

285
00:12:12,703 --> 00:12:14,769
On Belphegor's.
What?!

286
00:12:14,771 --> 00:12:16,705
He was a numerical analyst
at the Tory Foundation.

287
00:12:16,707 --> 00:12:17,873
I work mostly in combinatorics.

288
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,307
I thought we would make
a good team.

289
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:20,742
But there aren't
supposed to be teams.

290
00:12:20,744 --> 00:12:22,711
Not in a puzzle hunt.
It's bad form.

291
00:12:22,713 --> 00:12:23,713
Harlan...

292
00:12:23,714 --> 00:12:25,514
I'm just saying...

293
00:12:25,516 --> 00:12:27,315
My husband
wouldn't understand,

294
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:30,385
so I decided I wouldn't tell him
until after we won the money.

295
00:12:30,387 --> 00:12:33,121
A team-- so that's how
you got there before me.

296
00:12:33,123 --> 00:12:34,489
I wasn't there.

297
00:12:34,491 --> 00:12:36,258
Tom and I were out of town
until this morning.

298
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,126
His cousin
was getting married in Hawaii.

299
00:12:38,128 --> 00:12:40,662
That's why Ike went
to the coordinates by himself.

300
00:12:40,664 --> 00:12:42,097
Because I couldn't.

301
00:12:44,268 --> 00:12:46,601
These are pictures I took.

302
00:12:46,603 --> 00:12:49,337
Check the dates.

303
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:51,506
You gave the police
nine other names?

304
00:12:51,508 --> 00:12:53,408
People you thought
were competing?

305
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,776
I've got 16.

306
00:12:54,778 --> 00:12:56,311
And I know they were competing.

307
00:12:58,448 --> 00:13:01,249
He talked to her
outside the Jamaica property

308
00:13:01,251 --> 00:13:05,720
for about 20 minutes,
and then this truck rolled up.

309
00:13:05,722 --> 00:13:07,822
Any idea what's
inside the crate?

310
00:13:07,824 --> 00:13:09,024
Nope.

311
00:13:09,026 --> 00:13:10,392
I can't identify
the woman either.

312
00:13:10,394 --> 00:13:12,260
Everything about her
said money though.

313
00:13:12,262 --> 00:13:15,363
She, Keswick
and the mystery box

314
00:13:15,365 --> 00:13:17,732
stayed inside the building
for about three hours,

315
00:13:17,734 --> 00:13:20,001
and then off they went.

316
00:13:20,904 --> 00:13:22,170
Good.

317
00:13:22,172 --> 00:13:23,872
Okay.

318
00:13:23,874 --> 00:13:26,074
You know where
to send the check.

319
00:13:26,076 --> 00:13:30,145
You haven't asked me about
the file Sherlock gave me.

320
00:13:30,147 --> 00:13:32,080
Why would I?

321
00:13:32,082 --> 00:13:36,184
You said it would give me
a better sense of you-- it did.

322
00:13:37,588 --> 00:13:40,155
That's why you asked
for my help.

323
00:13:40,157 --> 00:13:41,990
Because you felt sorry for me.

324
00:13:41,992 --> 00:13:44,226
No.

325
00:13:44,228 --> 00:13:46,194
You just don't seem interested
in anything

326
00:13:46,196 --> 00:13:48,063
outside of becoming
a detective.

327
00:13:48,065 --> 00:13:50,999
There she is.

328
00:13:51,001 --> 00:13:53,301
The old counselor.

329
00:13:53,303 --> 00:13:55,637
Who used to hold
Sherlock's hand.

330
00:13:57,608 --> 00:13:59,741
Everything that you read,

331
00:13:59,743 --> 00:14:02,510
everything that happened to me,
that's all it is.

332
00:14:02,512 --> 00:14:04,646
It's just something
that happened.

333
00:14:04,648 --> 00:14:08,116
And it's all
in the past now.

334
00:14:08,118 --> 00:14:10,685
So let's just
leave it there, shall we?

335
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:24,667
Hello.

336
00:14:24,668 --> 00:14:26,001
You've had sex.

337
00:14:26,003 --> 00:14:27,202
Excuse me?

338
00:14:27,204 --> 00:14:28,503
I can hear it
in your voice.

339
00:14:28,505 --> 00:14:29,771
You've joined paunches.

340
00:14:29,773 --> 00:14:30,972
Good for you, Watson.

341
00:14:30,974 --> 00:14:32,807
As you know, I think
the act of love

342
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:34,676
can be quite conducive to...
What do you want?

343
00:14:34,678 --> 00:14:36,911
Merely to apprise you
of a new development

344
00:14:36,913 --> 00:14:38,280
in the murder of
Ike Walaczek.

345
00:14:38,282 --> 00:14:40,115
As I informed
you yesterday,

346
00:14:40,117 --> 00:14:42,284
Harlan and I were given
a new list of competitors.

347
00:14:42,286 --> 00:14:45,320
One name leapt out:
Byron Lowenthal.

348
00:14:45,322 --> 00:14:48,156
He's a statistician at the
Public Utilities Commission

349
00:14:48,158 --> 00:14:50,425
and a diagnosed
paranoid schizophrenic.

350
00:14:50,427 --> 00:14:52,160
He's been hospitalized
for becoming violent

351
00:14:52,162 --> 00:14:53,728
on no fewer
than three occasions.

352
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,964
Certainly sounds like
it could be our guy.

353
00:14:55,966 --> 00:14:59,367
Unfortunately, Mr. Lowenthal had
another break earlier this year.

354
00:14:59,369 --> 00:15:02,137
He's been staying in
a transient hotel ever since.

355
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:04,239
Detective Bell and I
are going to speak with him.

356
00:15:04,241 --> 00:15:05,307
You want me to meet you?

357
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:06,875
Oh, no, we're already here.

358
00:15:06,877 --> 00:15:08,410
Anyway, now that I know
that you've enjoyed coitus

359
00:15:08,412 --> 00:15:09,778
and could enjoy more
in the near future...

360
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,846
When you're done,
we need to talk.

361
00:15:14,718 --> 00:15:16,818
Byron Lowenthal,
you in there?

362
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,053
Who is it?

363
00:15:18,055 --> 00:15:19,754
It's Detective Bell, NYPD.

364
00:15:19,756 --> 00:15:22,257
My colleague and I would like
to ask you some questions.

365
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:24,592
Let me
get some pants on.

366
00:15:37,341 --> 00:15:40,008
S-Sorry, I just... I, um...

367
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,310
I-I thought I heard
Mr. Lowenthal retr...

368
00:16:19,154 --> 00:16:21,267
You guys got lucky.

369
00:16:21,268 --> 00:16:22,868
Well, luck had little
to do with it, actually.

370
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,536
I... I heard Mr. Lowenthal

371
00:16:24,538 --> 00:16:27,039
pulling a heavy object off
a shelf, placing it on his bed,

372
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,041
and the sound of
the zipper indicated

373
00:16:29,043 --> 00:16:30,976
that it was
a large gun case.

374
00:16:30,978 --> 00:16:33,579
Looks like he was sane enough
to do math, but not much else.

375
00:16:33,581 --> 00:16:34,747
Plus, he was
pretty hopped up.

376
00:16:34,749 --> 00:16:36,448
Caffeine pills,
energy drinks,

377
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,251
pretty much every legal
stimulant you can buy.

378
00:16:39,253 --> 00:16:40,853
Plus a few illegal ones.

379
00:16:40,855 --> 00:16:42,821
Hmm. Obviously, he was
keeping himself awake

380
00:16:42,823 --> 00:16:44,490
so he could work on
Belphegor's.

381
00:16:44,492 --> 00:16:47,392
This... is obvious to you?

382
00:16:47,394 --> 00:16:48,961
I confess the maths
are beyond me,

383
00:16:48,963 --> 00:16:51,130
but I took the liberty of
sending pictures of what

384
00:16:51,132 --> 00:16:52,865
appear to be Mr. Lowenthal's
most recent scribbles

385
00:16:52,867 --> 00:16:54,166
to Harlan Emple,
and he's confirmed

386
00:16:54,168 --> 00:16:55,667
they are part of the contest.

387
00:16:55,669 --> 00:16:56,969
With your permission,
I'd like copies of these

388
00:16:56,971 --> 00:16:58,837
sent to my home
so he can review them.

389
00:16:58,839 --> 00:16:59,972
What for?

390
00:16:59,974 --> 00:17:01,073
If Byron Lowenthal

391
00:17:01,075 --> 00:17:02,441
did kill Ike Walaczek,

392
00:17:02,443 --> 00:17:04,109
then he used
and obscured a phone number,

393
00:17:04,111 --> 00:17:05,878
which would have yielded
the next problem.

394
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,379
That problem's solution

395
00:17:07,381 --> 00:17:08,714
would be GPS coordinates.

396
00:17:08,716 --> 00:17:10,415
If he's recorded them
in his books...

397
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:12,551
Your pal will be able to tell us
where he's headed next.

398
00:17:12,553 --> 00:17:14,853
I'll get our guys to give you

399
00:17:14,855 --> 00:17:16,388
whatever you need.

400
00:17:17,258 --> 00:17:18,991
Scans are still coming through,

401
00:17:18,993 --> 00:17:21,260
but I've put what we've got
so far up on the wall.

402
00:17:21,262 --> 00:17:23,262
Sherlock said that
you prefer it that way.

403
00:17:23,264 --> 00:17:25,030
Picked it up from him,
actually.

404
00:17:25,032 --> 00:17:28,600
Makes me feel like I'm really
inside of the problem.

405
00:17:30,704 --> 00:17:33,372
I'll, uh, let you know
if I need anything.

406
00:17:34,275 --> 00:17:35,974
Oh, I work without a shirt.

407
00:17:35,976 --> 00:17:38,911
Sometimes makes me feel
closer to the numbers.

408
00:17:38,913 --> 00:17:42,147
You'll need to, uh,
check the printer in the study

409
00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:43,615
for more pages.

410
00:17:43,617 --> 00:17:45,417
Uh, this is nice,
you know?

411
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:47,452
Meeting another member
of the team.

412
00:17:47,454 --> 00:17:48,654
You know, Team Sherlock.

413
00:17:48,656 --> 00:17:50,656
You help him, I help him...

414
00:17:51,926 --> 00:17:53,559
Obviously, you haven't
tackled a case

415
00:17:53,561 --> 00:17:55,093
with high-order math since
you started working with him,

416
00:17:55,095 --> 00:17:57,729
or we would've...

417
00:17:57,731 --> 00:17:59,031
What?

418
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:00,232
What?

419
00:18:00,234 --> 00:18:01,834
Wait...

420
00:18:01,836 --> 00:18:04,002
have you worked a case
with high-order math?

421
00:18:04,805 --> 00:18:06,238
You have, haven't you?

422
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,840
Does it matter?

423
00:18:07,842 --> 00:18:09,842
Of course it...

424
00:18:09,844 --> 00:18:11,443
Oh, my God.

425
00:18:11,445 --> 00:18:13,278
Did he fire me?

426
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,980
All I know
is that back in London,

427
00:18:14,982 --> 00:18:16,982
we worked a case that involved
Fibonacci spirals...

428
00:18:16,984 --> 00:18:18,483
He fired me.

429
00:18:18,485 --> 00:18:21,386
...and he called some woman
named Indira Patel.

430
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,856
She's at Berkeley.

431
00:18:23,858 --> 00:18:25,624
I'm three time zones closer!

432
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:27,125
You're here now.

433
00:18:27,127 --> 00:18:29,428
Sure, because I found
a dead body.

434
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,531
I have to go; I have to run
some errands for Sherlock.

435
00:18:35,936 --> 00:18:37,903
I-I don't know
what was in the crate,

436
00:18:37,905 --> 00:18:39,271
but the stenciling on
the side indicates

437
00:18:39,273 --> 00:18:40,772
it came from one of
the SUNY schools.

438
00:18:40,774 --> 00:18:42,908
I put another detective
on Keswick...

439
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:45,177
Don't kill me, I had to
use your razor to shave.

440
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:47,179
I...

441
00:18:47,181 --> 00:18:49,147
You must be Andrew.

442
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:50,515
Sherlock Holmes.

443
00:18:50,517 --> 00:18:52,551
Sorry.

444
00:18:52,553 --> 00:18:55,487
Joan said you were coming;
I... I forgot.

445
00:18:55,489 --> 00:18:57,122
It's not how
I wanted to meet you.

446
00:18:57,124 --> 00:18:58,891
She said you can tell
a lot about people

447
00:18:58,893 --> 00:19:00,192
just by looking at them.

448
00:19:00,194 --> 00:19:02,261
I swear, I...
usually wear pants.

449
00:19:02,263 --> 00:19:03,729
Well, in my experience,
most people

450
00:19:03,731 --> 00:19:05,264
need only be concerned
I won't notice

451
00:19:05,266 --> 00:19:06,498
anything worth remarking upon.

452
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:10,535
Watson seems adequately sexed.

453
00:19:11,939 --> 00:19:13,672
Hey.

454
00:19:13,674 --> 00:19:15,674
I was just introducing myself.

455
00:19:17,945 --> 00:19:20,379
I've got that thing.
I'll see you tonight.

456
00:19:20,381 --> 00:19:21,580
Okay.

457
00:19:27,855 --> 00:19:30,188
Your home, Watson...

458
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,823
it's utterly pleasant.

459
00:19:31,825 --> 00:19:33,692
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

460
00:19:33,694 --> 00:19:35,394
When you told me
you wanted a life of your own,

461
00:19:35,396 --> 00:19:36,595
I didn't realize
that you meant you wanted

462
00:19:36,597 --> 00:19:38,030
the same life everyone else has.

463
00:19:38,032 --> 00:19:39,464
But at any rate,
none of my business, is it?

464
00:19:39,466 --> 00:19:41,233
It's not.
And I didn't ask you here

465
00:19:41,235 --> 00:19:42,634
to talk about my apartment.

466
00:19:42,636 --> 00:19:44,970
No, you asked me here
to discuss Kitty.

467
00:19:44,972 --> 00:19:46,471
If she were not
the topic of conversation,

468
00:19:46,473 --> 00:19:48,941
then you wouldn't have
invited me to your home,

469
00:19:48,943 --> 00:19:50,776
where there's no chance
she'll be present.

470
00:19:52,346 --> 00:19:53,946
She disappointed you
in some way.

471
00:19:53,948 --> 00:19:55,247
Skills not up to snuff?

472
00:19:55,249 --> 00:19:57,316
Please remember
she is a novice.

473
00:19:57,318 --> 00:19:58,850
Actually, she did a great job.

474
00:19:58,852 --> 00:20:00,285
But I have some concerns.

475
00:20:00,287 --> 00:20:01,954
I thought we could
talk about them.

476
00:20:03,757 --> 00:20:04,923
You think that
Kitty needs help

477
00:20:04,925 --> 00:20:06,091
above and beyond
my mentorship.

478
00:20:06,093 --> 00:20:07,392
You read the same
file I did.

479
00:20:07,394 --> 00:20:08,894
She's a rape victim.

480
00:20:08,896 --> 00:20:11,296
She was kept and tortured.

481
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,899
Mm.

482
00:20:16,136 --> 00:20:19,171
You know me, so surely you know

483
00:20:19,173 --> 00:20:22,874
I've broached the subject of
a support group meeting before.

484
00:20:22,876 --> 00:20:25,010
Even offered
to pay for therapy.

485
00:20:25,012 --> 00:20:26,812
She's not interested, I know.

486
00:20:26,814 --> 00:20:28,447
Just as you also know

487
00:20:28,449 --> 00:20:30,749
someone with a problem
can't be forced to get help.

488
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:32,551
They have to want it.

489
00:20:32,553 --> 00:20:34,786
What Kitty wants
is to be a detective.

490
00:20:36,523 --> 00:20:38,490
I am taking pains
to try and channel

491
00:20:38,492 --> 00:20:40,592
her residual feelings
into her work.

492
00:20:42,329 --> 00:20:44,463
Well, that works out
great for you.

493
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:48,400
You told me that
you took on a partner

494
00:20:48,402 --> 00:20:50,635
because you wanted to replicate
what you and I had.

495
00:20:50,637 --> 00:20:52,637
That you thought it helped
with your recovery.

496
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:54,539
You think I would
try and take advantage

497
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,208
of the victim of a trauma?

498
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,910
Of course not, but there is
a conflict of interest here.

499
00:20:58,912 --> 00:21:02,447
She needs what she needs,
but you need what you need, too.

500
00:21:06,053 --> 00:21:10,055
It's-it's good that you're
in her life now, Watson.

501
00:21:10,057 --> 00:21:12,524
I mean,
it's commonly believed that, um,

502
00:21:12,526 --> 00:21:16,228
a child benefits mostly from
the presence of two parents.

503
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,164
He-- or she, in this case--
can absorb certain qualities

504
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,466
from the father--
clear-eyed view of the world,

505
00:21:21,468 --> 00:21:23,168
capacity of
rational thought, etcetera.

506
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,170
They can also absorb certain
qualities from the mother.

507
00:21:25,172 --> 00:21:27,105
Excuse me, but I am not
Kitty's mother,

508
00:21:27,107 --> 00:21:28,807
and she sure as hell
is not our child.

509
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:30,942
You brought her here;
she looks up to you.

510
00:21:30,944 --> 00:21:32,944
She says that she doesn't
need help-- fine--

511
00:21:32,946 --> 00:21:34,579
but you know better.

512
00:21:34,581 --> 00:21:37,082
And you're gonna have to be
the one that tells her.

513
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,620
It's Harlan.

514
00:21:41,622 --> 00:21:44,523
Making progress with the maths.

515
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,660
We thought
that Byron and Ike

516
00:21:48,662 --> 00:21:50,462
arrived at Portal Ten
simultaneously.

517
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,664
That would've meant that they
were doing all the same math

518
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,032
at essentially
the same time.

519
00:21:54,034 --> 00:21:56,001
Only, the math
you found at Byron's place

520
00:21:56,003 --> 00:21:57,003
says that's wrong.

521
00:21:57,004 --> 00:21:58,470
He was one step behind Ike.

522
00:21:58,472 --> 00:22:00,705
Are you proposing he did
not kill Mr. Walaczek?

523
00:22:00,707 --> 00:22:03,175
I don't know, but that's
not the weirdest part.

524
00:22:03,177 --> 00:22:04,810
Byron was obsessive.

525
00:22:04,812 --> 00:22:06,211
He time-stamped
almost everything he did.

526
00:22:06,213 --> 00:22:09,047
He only solved
the Portal Nine problem,

527
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:11,316
the same problem that sent me
to that old factory last night.

528
00:22:11,318 --> 00:22:12,884
But get this--

529
00:22:12,886 --> 00:22:14,686
he wasn't given
the same problem as me.

530
00:22:14,688 --> 00:22:16,655
And so it would've yielded
GPS coordinates

531
00:22:16,657 --> 00:22:18,323
for an entirely
different location.

532
00:22:18,325 --> 00:22:21,760
The person in charge of
the game changed the clue

533
00:22:21,762 --> 00:22:23,328
after the police
found Ike's body.

534
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:25,964
Well, he had to, right?

535
00:22:25,966 --> 00:22:27,899
If he hadn't, he would be
sending other competitors

536
00:22:27,901 --> 00:22:29,101
to an active crime scene.

537
00:22:29,103 --> 00:22:30,402
The important thing is

538
00:22:30,404 --> 00:22:31,536
I figured out the coordinates

539
00:22:31,538 --> 00:22:32,771
to the second location.

540
00:22:32,773 --> 00:22:35,540
I know where Byron went.

541
00:22:35,542 --> 00:22:36,842
What are you doing?

542
00:22:36,844 --> 00:22:38,410
You're saying he
time-stamped everything.

543
00:22:38,412 --> 00:22:40,345
I'm looking at the time
he received his clues.

544
00:22:40,347 --> 00:22:42,647
It's all there, to the second,
but what does that have to do...

545
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:44,149
What if you hadn't
found a body?

546
00:22:44,151 --> 00:22:46,118
If the game had
proceeded as planned,

547
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,486
what were you meant
to do there?

548
00:22:47,488 --> 00:22:49,354
I would have sent a text
to the phone number,

549
00:22:49,356 --> 00:22:51,523
the one that the killer painted
over, and then I would have

550
00:22:51,525 --> 00:22:52,891
gotten a message back
with the next problem.

551
00:22:52,893 --> 00:22:54,559
There's an extra
step in there.

552
00:22:54,561 --> 00:22:56,428
Why all this rigmarole with
phone numbers and texts?

553
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,064
Why not just post the problem
itself at the factory?

554
00:22:59,066 --> 00:23:02,100
I don't know, it's just the way
the game is played.

555
00:23:02,102 --> 00:23:04,102
They're for an old
industrial area in Queens.

556
00:23:04,104 --> 00:23:06,805
You're welcome
for finding your suspect.

557
00:23:06,807 --> 00:23:09,207
If I'm right, Harlan,
what you've found...

558
00:23:09,209 --> 00:23:11,109
is the site of
another murder.

559
00:23:11,111 --> 00:23:13,245
Byron Lowenthal's.

560
00:23:15,983 --> 00:23:18,216
You were right,
Lowenthal's dead.

561
00:23:18,218 --> 00:23:20,952
He was shot in the foot,
then the knee.

562
00:23:20,954 --> 00:23:22,821
Just like
Ike Wallaczek.

563
00:23:22,823 --> 00:23:26,391
I'm, uh, gonna look
over here now.

564
00:23:26,393 --> 00:23:29,427
Well, we think the perp
was pulling the body

565
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:31,429
to a car that was parked
over there.

566
00:23:31,431 --> 00:23:34,065
Then he just
left him here.

567
00:23:34,067 --> 00:23:35,901
Probably afraid
he'd been spotted.

568
00:23:35,903 --> 00:23:38,803
There's a lot
of homeless in the area.

569
00:23:41,441 --> 00:23:43,008
Question is:

570
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:45,010
how'd you know
Lowenthal was the next victim

571
00:23:45,012 --> 00:23:46,511
and not the killer?

572
00:23:49,316 --> 00:23:51,750
Well, that's
quite simple, really.

573
00:23:51,752 --> 00:23:54,352
The game is directing
its players to remote locales,

574
00:23:54,354 --> 00:23:56,788
and then instructing them
to send a text message

575
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,256
indicating their presence.

576
00:23:58,258 --> 00:24:00,125
I suspect the killer wanted
to remove the body

577
00:24:00,127 --> 00:24:02,928
so he could keep this new
location “in play,” so to speak.

578
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:05,130
Still missing the “simple” part.

579
00:24:05,132 --> 00:24:06,698
The late Mr. Lowenthal

580
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,366
received his final clue

581
00:24:08,368 --> 00:24:10,235
after Harlan discovered
Ike Wallaczek's body,

582
00:24:10,237 --> 00:24:12,737
but before news of the killing
had reached the media.

583
00:24:12,739 --> 00:24:14,439
That means the
game's designer

584
00:24:14,441 --> 00:24:16,408
knew the location
had been compromised.

585
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,577
And the only way
that he could have known that,

586
00:24:18,579 --> 00:24:20,111
at the time that he knew it,

587
00:24:20,113 --> 00:24:21,880
was if he, himself,
was the killer.

588
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,917
Belphegor's Prime is not
a treasure hunt.

589
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,619
It's a trap.

590
00:24:40,696 --> 00:24:42,196
Better?

591
00:24:42,198 --> 00:24:44,665
False alarm.

592
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:47,668
But I still feel
a little queasy.

593
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,273
This new dead guy--

594
00:24:52,275 --> 00:24:54,875
your friend said that he was
tortured, too, right?

595
00:24:54,877 --> 00:24:57,244
Right before the killer tried
to abscond with his corpse.

596
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:59,213
I assume
he intended to take

597
00:24:59,215 --> 00:25:02,383
Ike Wallaczek away with him
as well, only Ike was too large.

598
00:25:02,385 --> 00:25:04,685
A speedy mothballing
was the best he could do.

599
00:25:04,687 --> 00:25:07,221
So, just to recap,

600
00:25:07,223 --> 00:25:09,657
I've spent the last
few months of my life

601
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:13,360
playing a game that was
designed to kill me.

602
00:25:13,362 --> 00:25:15,629
Got to be a metaphor
in there somewhere, right?

603
00:25:15,631 --> 00:25:18,966
I think the word you're
looking for is “moral.”

604
00:25:18,968 --> 00:25:21,902
There is a moral in there:
games are for idiots.

605
00:25:24,707 --> 00:25:26,473
Breaking news from Ramapo.

606
00:25:26,475 --> 00:25:29,443
Kitty reports the Center for
Applied Mathematics and Logic

607
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,912
is not the sponsor
of Belphegor's Prime.

608
00:25:31,914 --> 00:25:34,148
Then it's got to be
a serial killer, right?

609
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,716
Someone who's obsessed
with mathematicians?

610
00:25:35,718 --> 00:25:37,284
Mm.

611
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,920
Perhaps he was bullied
by mathematicians as a child.

612
00:25:39,922 --> 00:25:42,056
Or mathematicians
killed his parents.

613
00:25:42,058 --> 00:25:43,657
I'm being serious.

614
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:45,726
Serial killers who devise
elaborate death traps

615
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,461
are the stuff of pulp fiction.

616
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:49,229
And besides, with respect
to these murders,

617
00:25:49,231 --> 00:25:51,165
there are none
of the elaborations

618
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:53,767
which mark that sort of culprit.

619
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:55,970
If anything, I would describe
the work as businesslike.

620
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:58,172
Then it's the government.

621
00:25:58,174 --> 00:26:01,241
I mean, the-the game was some
sort of test to weed out people

622
00:26:01,243 --> 00:26:03,243
who could weaponize math.

623
00:26:03,245 --> 00:26:05,179
The American intelligence
apparatus may be clod-like,

624
00:26:05,181 --> 00:26:07,014
but I think they would
do a better job

625
00:26:07,016 --> 00:26:08,749
of disposing of two bodies,
don't you?

626
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:11,785
Watson?

627
00:26:11,787 --> 00:26:13,621
I just heard
from one of the suspects

628
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:14,922
Marcus and I talked to
yesterday,

629
00:26:14,924 --> 00:26:16,290
another puzzle-hunter.

630
00:26:16,292 --> 00:26:18,525
Tell me he confessed
to the murders.

631
00:26:18,527 --> 00:26:20,427
We ruled him out right away,
but he heard about

632
00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:22,329
Byron Lowenthal's murder on
the news and wanted me to know

633
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:25,165
he's at a friend's place,
some guy named Paul.

634
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,934
That is fascinating.

635
00:26:26,936 --> 00:26:28,369
Actually, it might be.

636
00:26:28,371 --> 00:26:31,038
Paul is positive he knows
who the killer is.

637
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,807
I know the guards
are a bit much,

638
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:35,509
but I wanted everyone
to feel safe.

639
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:38,178
And, besides,
math has been good to me.

640
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,279
Commodities.

641
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:40,848
So, you and your friends,

642
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:43,150
you were competitors
in Belphegor's Prime?

643
00:26:43,152 --> 00:26:45,352
Most of us. Some of the others
are just here for the math.

644
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,121
You said you could
identify the killer.

645
00:26:47,123 --> 00:26:49,323
I can, sort of.

646
00:26:52,061 --> 00:26:54,194
“Mo Shellshocker.”

647
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:56,930
It's a pseudonym,
obviously, but I'm telling you,

648
00:26:56,932 --> 00:26:58,365
this is the guy
you're looking for.

649
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,600
I've heard of him.

650
00:26:59,602 --> 00:27:01,335
He uses his blog
to expose bad math.

651
00:27:01,337 --> 00:27:03,837
Corrupt economists, biased
pollsters, that sort of thing.

652
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:05,572
He's actually
sort of a crusader.

653
00:27:05,574 --> 00:27:06,574
He's a murderer.

654
00:27:06,575 --> 00:27:09,143
How can you be
so sure?

655
00:27:09,145 --> 00:27:10,744
When he isn't crusading,
he's competing in puzzle hunts.

656
00:27:10,746 --> 00:27:11,812
A few months ago,

657
00:27:11,814 --> 00:27:13,080
he claimed to
have solved

658
00:27:13,082 --> 00:27:14,815
Cicada 3301 two
years in a row.

659
00:27:14,817 --> 00:27:17,484
Some people called BS,
including...

660
00:27:17,486 --> 00:27:20,120
Ike Wallaczek
and Byron Lowenthal.

661
00:27:20,122 --> 00:27:21,221
“WallaCheckYourMath,”

662
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:22,489
“ByLow2020.”

663
00:27:22,491 --> 00:27:23,757
Those are their
online handles.

664
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:25,392
Their friends
will confirm it.

665
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,528
A flame war does not
a murderer make.

666
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:30,097
The stuff these guys were
slinging at each other was ugly.

667
00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:32,099
Mo knew they were into hunts,
and so he built one

668
00:27:32,101 --> 00:27:34,034
that would send them to places
where he could kill them.

669
00:27:34,036 --> 00:27:35,469
That's what we're
doing here is

670
00:27:35,471 --> 00:27:36,837
we're just sifting
through all the math

671
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:38,338
he's posted on his blog
over the years,

672
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,840
to see if we could
find his signature

673
00:27:39,842 --> 00:27:41,975
or something that
could identify him.

674
00:27:41,977 --> 00:27:45,279
If two people weren't dead,
we'd probably be having fun.

675
00:27:45,281 --> 00:27:46,747
But still, the
chances that he left

676
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:48,582
something like that
in his math...

677
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,784
If it's there, we'll find it.
In the meantime,

678
00:27:50,786 --> 00:27:52,186
we thought the
police should know

679
00:27:52,188 --> 00:27:53,687
who they're really
dealing with.

680
00:27:53,689 --> 00:27:55,389
<i>I've got to go meet someone</i>

681
00:27:55,391 --> 00:27:56,924
about my other case.

682
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:59,927
You're good to pass all this
along to Marcus? Okay.

683
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:03,030
I must say, I'm surprised you
didn't offer to stay and help.

684
00:28:03,032 --> 00:28:05,265
Mr. Ettinger makes
a compelling case with respect

685
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,067
to Mo Shellshocker's
viability as a suspect.

686
00:28:07,069 --> 00:28:09,002
Mo is a genius.

687
00:28:09,004 --> 00:28:10,637
We're talking off the charts.

688
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:12,139
Leibniz meets Euler meets Gauss.

689
00:28:12,141 --> 00:28:14,108
Huh.
He may have an ego,

690
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,110
but he's not gonna kill
anyone over a few comments.

691
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:18,312
So, while “The League of
Concerned Mathematician”"

692
00:28:18,314 --> 00:28:21,014
chases its tail up there, I
am gonna do the smart thing

693
00:28:21,016 --> 00:28:22,416
and get out of town.

694
00:28:22,418 --> 00:28:24,485
You can let me know
when it all blows over.

695
00:28:24,487 --> 00:28:26,386
You're not going
anywhere, Harlan.

696
00:28:26,388 --> 00:28:29,223
Or should I call you
Mo Shellshocker?

697
00:28:32,728 --> 00:28:34,661
Did you honestly think
I wouldn't recognize

698
00:28:34,663 --> 00:28:36,130
an anagram of my own name?

699
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:40,567
I knew I should've gone
with “Choker Hell Moss”"

700
00:28:40,569 --> 00:28:42,569
But I never thought
that you would see it, okay?

701
00:28:42,571 --> 00:28:44,104
Math is my thing, not yours.

702
00:28:44,106 --> 00:28:46,473
It's my name, Harlan;
that makes it my thing.

703
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,675
It was an homage.

704
00:28:48,677 --> 00:28:50,043
Explain.

705
00:28:50,045 --> 00:28:52,045
Every day, all over the world,

706
00:28:52,047 --> 00:28:54,348
math is used to trick people.

707
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,917
Data dredging to sell
pharmaceuticals.

708
00:28:56,919 --> 00:28:59,720
Publication bias
to justify wars.

709
00:28:59,722 --> 00:29:02,322
In the wrong hands, math can be
manipulated, abused.

710
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:05,425
And I decided to do
something about it.

711
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:09,596
You catch people
who murder other people.

712
00:29:09,598 --> 00:29:11,431
I catch people who murder math.

713
00:29:11,433 --> 00:29:14,568
According to this,
Mo is a wanted man.

714
00:29:17,606 --> 00:29:19,940
Harlan?

715
00:29:19,942 --> 00:29:23,110
The D.O.D. was working
on a new fighter.

716
00:29:23,112 --> 00:29:27,047
Only, I knew that the
performance stats were bogus.

717
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:29,116
A friend of mine found
the internal numbers,

718
00:29:29,118 --> 00:29:31,251
and I sort of published them.

719
00:29:31,253 --> 00:29:33,320
So you put classified
Department of Defense documents

720
00:29:33,322 --> 00:29:34,888
on the Internet.

721
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:36,623
Isn't that what
you would have done?

722
00:29:38,928 --> 00:29:41,562
Fine! I screwed up, okay?

723
00:29:41,564 --> 00:29:43,730
But, hey, that's what I do,
right? I screw up.

724
00:29:43,732 --> 00:29:46,233
If I didn't, then probably you
wouldn't have secretly fired me.

725
00:29:46,235 --> 00:29:47,968
Excuse me?

726
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,403
I know about Indira Patel!

727
00:29:51,006 --> 00:29:53,340
I know you replaced me.

728
00:29:55,144 --> 00:29:58,979
Kitty, I think
we could use some tea.

729
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:04,318
Just tell me.

730
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,253
Tell me what math I got wrong.

731
00:30:06,255 --> 00:30:09,356
Tell me why you didn't let me
make it up to you.

732
00:30:09,358 --> 00:30:12,926
It wasn't the maths, it was you.

733
00:30:14,763 --> 00:30:18,232
Your work was impeccable.

734
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:20,334
And for the most part,
I enjoyed our collaborations.

735
00:30:20,336 --> 00:30:24,838
B-But over time, you just...
you became quite... needy.

736
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,406
What are you talking about?

737
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:29,109
Y-You asked my advice
on-on social matters,

738
00:30:29,111 --> 00:30:32,512
and you even invited me
to a party.

739
00:30:32,514 --> 00:30:34,648
You were my friend.

740
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,416
I was your employer, Harlan.

741
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:37,918
A-And you were my consultant.

742
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,419
One of many.

743
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:43,757
I know that I'm a little
obsessed with what I do.

744
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:46,960
That has always made it hard
to make friends.

745
00:30:46,962 --> 00:30:50,664
And I used to feel pretty bad
about that, and then I met you.

746
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:52,566
And I thought to myself,

747
00:30:52,568 --> 00:30:55,903
hey, if it doesn't bother him,
why should I let it bother me?

748
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:03,810
I got a lot
out of the work that we did.

749
00:31:03,812 --> 00:31:06,146
A lot.

750
00:31:06,148 --> 00:31:11,218
But if someone like you thinks
that I'm a loser, then...

751
00:31:22,564 --> 00:31:24,965
Hey, are we still doing this?

752
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:26,366
Doing what?

753
00:31:26,368 --> 00:31:28,502
Talking about the case.

754
00:31:28,504 --> 00:31:30,070
You're just sitting there.

755
00:31:30,072 --> 00:31:32,105
I'm thinking.

756
00:31:32,107 --> 00:31:34,308
I suspect the silence
is exacerbated

757
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,143
by the nature
of our communication.

758
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:37,811
Yes. Well, I don't
live there anymore.

759
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,713
So, if you want
to talk shop at night,

760
00:31:39,715 --> 00:31:41,515
this is the best I can do.

761
00:31:41,517 --> 00:31:45,252
Keep asking myself:
what did the killer want?

762
00:31:45,254 --> 00:31:48,255
He went to great lengths to lure
brilliant mathematicians

763
00:31:48,257 --> 00:31:49,489
to their deaths.

764
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,525
Winnowed out
the less gifted

765
00:31:51,527 --> 00:31:54,061
by making his problems
more and more complicated.

766
00:31:54,063 --> 00:31:57,597
He had a type, but I still think
he's a serial killer

767
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:59,266
only in the most
technical sense.

768
00:31:59,268 --> 00:32:01,201
He tortured both his victims.

769
00:32:01,203 --> 00:32:02,936
But there's no sign
that he enjoyed it.

770
00:32:02,938 --> 00:32:04,538
The work was
utilitarian,

771
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,740
suggesting it was
less for pleasure

772
00:32:06,742 --> 00:32:10,043
and more for persuasion.

773
00:32:10,045 --> 00:32:11,945
He wanted something.

774
00:32:11,947 --> 00:32:13,714
But what?

775
00:32:13,716 --> 00:32:16,483
Maybe there's a connection
between Wallaczek and Lowenthal

776
00:32:16,485 --> 00:32:18,418
we haven't spotted yet.

777
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,220
Maybe they were working
on a project together,

778
00:32:20,222 --> 00:32:21,822
something that was worth
a lot of money.

779
00:32:21,824 --> 00:32:23,857
There's no way the killer
could have predicted

780
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:26,093
which competitors would make it
to the terminal stage.

781
00:32:26,095 --> 00:32:28,795
That part of the game
was beyond his control.

782
00:32:28,797 --> 00:32:30,664
If it weren't,
he would've been prepared

783
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:33,300
to dispose of a body
the size of Ike Wallaczek's.

784
00:32:33,302 --> 00:32:35,335
So, even if there were a
connection between the victims,

785
00:32:35,337 --> 00:32:37,070
the killer could not
have counted on them

786
00:32:37,072 --> 00:32:38,839
being lured into his trap.

787
00:32:38,841 --> 00:32:41,041
Certainly not
in sequence.

788
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:45,112
His game was, in many respects,
one of chance.

789
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:51,718
Suggesting he knows what
he wants, but not who has it.

790
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,888
Like he was on a puzzle hunt
of his own.

791
00:32:56,825 --> 00:32:58,859
I'm back.

792
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:05,665
I'll set up
downstairs, yeah?

793
00:33:09,138 --> 00:33:11,238
I've been thinking about
what you said earlier.

794
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,740
I've decided to engage her
one more time

795
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:15,609
with regards
to her recuperation.

796
00:33:17,112 --> 00:33:21,815
I doubt she'll listen,
but I'll keep you apprised.

797
00:33:25,954 --> 00:33:27,421
I've been thinking.

798
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:29,623
About?
You. Your history.

799
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:31,825
Your decision
not to seek help.

800
00:33:31,827 --> 00:33:34,594
I think it's
a mistake.

801
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,530
Oh?

802
00:33:36,532 --> 00:33:38,198
I've looked into a number
of support groups.

803
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,633
As you are well aware,

804
00:33:39,635 --> 00:33:41,701
I have benefited greatly
from similar settings.

805
00:33:41,703 --> 00:33:43,270
You have.

806
00:33:43,272 --> 00:33:44,638
The process, I find,

807
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,906
is not unlike
voiding one's bowels...

808
00:33:45,908 --> 00:33:47,808
I'll go.
What?

809
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:49,676
I'll go.
Just get me the details.

810
00:33:52,014 --> 00:33:55,182
I've been thinking, too-- about
your number-cruncher, Harlan.

811
00:33:55,184 --> 00:33:57,017
You think I was
too hard on him.

812
00:33:57,019 --> 00:33:58,685
You will have consultants
of your own one day.

813
00:33:58,687 --> 00:34:01,488
You'll see that they require
management and focus.

814
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:04,124
They are but keys on a keyboard,
and we're the typists.

815
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:06,159
You could've given him
a shoeing for all I care.

816
00:34:06,161 --> 00:34:07,828
No, I'm just saying that

817
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:10,030
some of the stuff he's got
up to, it's quite good.

818
00:34:10,032 --> 00:34:11,698
You should take a look.

819
00:34:13,368 --> 00:34:15,735
You may find a fellow typist.

820
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,076
Hello?

821
00:34:23,078 --> 00:34:25,312
Yeah, I
hear that you and some friends

822
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:27,848
are trying to identify
Mo Shellshocker.

823
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,649
That's right. Who is this?

824
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:32,719
His name is Harlan Emple.

825
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:34,020
You got a pen?

826
00:34:34,022 --> 00:34:36,456
I'll-I'll give you his address.

827
00:34:52,454 --> 00:34:54,020
Harlan.

828
00:34:54,022 --> 00:34:56,356
You can't take a hint, can you?

829
00:34:56,358 --> 00:34:57,657
I got your text messages.

830
00:34:57,659 --> 00:34:58,958
I don't want to see you
right now.

831
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,827
So if you came here
to apologize...

832
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:03,363
Actually, I came here
to spare you an agonizing death.

833
00:35:04,299 --> 00:35:05,832
Can I come in?

834
00:35:05,834 --> 00:35:08,301
I was puzzling earlier

835
00:35:08,303 --> 00:35:12,038
as to why the killer went
to such specific lengths.

836
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,606
What did he want?

837
00:35:13,608 --> 00:35:15,809
And then Watson,
quite by accident,

838
00:35:15,811 --> 00:35:17,410
she made a most
compelling analogy.

839
00:35:17,412 --> 00:35:20,080
She said it was as if he
was on a hunt of his own.

840
00:35:20,082 --> 00:35:22,615
Duh. He was hunting
mathematicians.

841
00:35:22,617 --> 00:35:23,783
No, he wasn't.

842
00:35:23,785 --> 00:35:25,151
He was hunting<i> a</i> mathematician.

843
00:35:25,153 --> 00:35:26,619
One.

844
00:35:26,621 --> 00:35:29,389
A man who had concealed
his identity not only

845
00:35:29,391 --> 00:35:31,191
from the mathematics
community at large,

846
00:35:31,193 --> 00:35:32,859
but also from the FBI.

847
00:35:32,861 --> 00:35:35,395
A “crusader,”
you might call him.

848
00:35:35,397 --> 00:35:36,763
Wait a minute.

849
00:35:36,765 --> 00:35:38,731
Are you saying that
this was all about me?

850
00:35:53,448 --> 00:35:56,449
<i> Unfortunately, emulating</i>
<i>the work of people like me</i>

851
00:35:56,451 --> 00:35:59,018
<i>is not without risks.</i>

852
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,320
Creates enemies.

853
00:36:00,322 --> 00:36:02,889
I knew it was the government.

854
00:36:02,891 --> 00:36:04,424
It was a lottery winner.

855
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,260
Little over a year ago,

856
00:36:07,262 --> 00:36:09,529
you started a series of blogs
where you exposed the flaws

857
00:36:09,531 --> 00:36:11,664
in certain scratch card
lottery games.

858
00:36:11,666 --> 00:36:13,766
Tickets like this one.

859
00:36:13,768 --> 00:36:15,802
I wrote about
baited hook games.

860
00:36:15,804 --> 00:36:17,971
Games where the numbers
are printed on the front.

861
00:36:17,973 --> 00:36:20,707
Scratch off the hidden numbers,
hope for a match.

862
00:36:20,709 --> 00:36:23,309
Only, you proved that with
careful mathematical analysis

863
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:25,512
of the visible numbers,
you could predict

864
00:36:25,514 --> 00:36:28,381
which tickets were winners
80% of the time.

865
00:36:28,383 --> 00:36:29,682
If you had exploited

866
00:36:29,684 --> 00:36:32,085
this flaw,
rather than exposing it,

867
00:36:32,087 --> 00:36:33,520
you could have made millions.

868
00:36:33,522 --> 00:36:36,022
Well... sure.
But that would been cheating.

869
00:36:36,024 --> 00:36:37,157
Right.

870
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:38,825
So imagine
for a moment

871
00:36:38,827 --> 00:36:41,060
that you are a less
honest mathematician.

872
00:36:41,062 --> 00:36:42,495
Right?

873
00:36:42,497 --> 00:36:44,063
You've been taking
advantage of these games

874
00:36:44,065 --> 00:36:47,967
for a couple of years to
amass a small fortune.

875
00:36:47,969 --> 00:36:49,502
And then “Mo"
comes along.

876
00:36:49,504 --> 00:36:51,971
He starts exposing
the broken games.

877
00:36:51,973 --> 00:36:54,340
State lottery commissions
shut them down.

878
00:36:54,342 --> 00:36:56,976
The exploitable
games dry up.

879
00:36:56,978 --> 00:37:00,613
Now, if you were a
psychopathic lottery cheat,

880
00:37:00,615 --> 00:37:02,582
how do you fix that?

881
00:37:02,584 --> 00:37:04,484
You kill Mo.

882
00:37:04,486 --> 00:37:07,253
<i>Unfortunately, Mo is elusive.</i>

883
00:37:07,255 --> 00:37:08,821
<i>Anonymous.</i>

884
00:37:08,823 --> 00:37:11,224
The only thing
he knew about him for sure

885
00:37:11,226 --> 00:37:14,394
was that he could not resist
a puzzle hunt.

886
00:37:14,396 --> 00:37:17,130
Now, if you were smart enough
to identify

887
00:37:17,132 --> 00:37:19,399
and take advantage of
broken lottery games...

888
00:37:19,401 --> 00:37:21,868
Then I'm smart enough
to design a puzzle hunt.

889
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:25,338
This plan was not
without its flaws.

890
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:28,775
Once a competitor
reached the terminal stage,

891
00:37:28,777 --> 00:37:32,745
the killer could not be certain
that he'd trapped Mo, could he?

892
00:37:32,747 --> 00:37:34,480
So he tortured them.

893
00:37:34,482 --> 00:37:37,083
I submit he forced them to
log on to Mo's Web site,

894
00:37:37,085 --> 00:37:39,686
and when they failed...

895
00:37:41,323 --> 00:37:42,755
After two murders,

896
00:37:42,757 --> 00:37:44,290
the game was compromised.

897
00:37:44,292 --> 00:37:46,192
So the killer devises
a Plan “B.”

898
00:37:46,194 --> 00:37:47,460
He tricks

899
00:37:47,462 --> 00:37:49,229
a group of his peers

900
00:37:49,231 --> 00:37:51,097
into helping search
for an alternative means

901
00:37:51,099 --> 00:37:53,032
of identifying Mo.

902
00:37:56,504 --> 00:37:58,438
You're talking about that guy.

903
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,906
The one with the penthouse.

904
00:37:59,908 --> 00:38:02,742
<i>Paul?</i>

905
00:38:02,744 --> 00:38:05,044
Lottery winners
are public record.

906
00:38:05,046 --> 00:38:07,814
So when I searched for
the names of repeat winners

907
00:38:07,816 --> 00:38:09,482
in the dates prior
to your posts...

908
00:38:09,484 --> 00:38:11,317
I can't believe
I drank his water.

909
00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:12,685
I called him.

910
00:38:12,687 --> 00:38:14,654
I identified you as Mo.

911
00:38:14,656 --> 00:38:16,122
And I gave him your address.

912
00:38:16,124 --> 00:38:17,590
You what?!

913
00:38:21,129 --> 00:38:23,062
Drop your weapon!

914
00:38:23,064 --> 00:38:24,597
<i>I did not, however, give him</i>

915
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:25,965
<i>the correct apartment number.</i>

916
00:38:25,967 --> 00:38:28,334
He was arrested
a little over an hour ago.

917
00:38:30,739 --> 00:38:31,871
Tried to call you to
tell you, but, um...

918
00:38:31,873 --> 00:38:33,539
But I was ignoring you.

919
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:35,008
Yes, you were ignoring me.

920
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,209
Look, you know

921
00:38:36,211 --> 00:38:37,377
that I'm still screwed, right?

922
00:38:37,379 --> 00:38:39,279
You told him that I'm Mo.

923
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:42,115
He's gonna tell the police,
they're gonna tell the FBI...

924
00:38:42,117 --> 00:38:43,516
The NYPD is under
the impression

925
00:38:43,518 --> 00:38:45,385
that I lied about
your connection to Mo

926
00:38:45,387 --> 00:38:47,920
in order to draw
Mr. Ettinger out.

927
00:38:47,922 --> 00:38:49,555
As far as the
FBI goes, well,

928
00:38:49,557 --> 00:38:51,958
I've got some associates
who have created a trail

929
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,860
which will
strongly suggest that Mo

930
00:38:53,862 --> 00:38:55,728
is a cyber-terrorist
I became aware of

931
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:58,197
whilst working for, um...

932
00:38:58,199 --> 00:38:59,766
queen and country.

933
00:38:59,768 --> 00:39:02,135
Your secret's
quite safe.

934
00:39:02,137 --> 00:39:03,903
Thanks.

935
00:39:06,508 --> 00:39:09,776
My reasons for preserving you
are entirely selfish, Harlan.

936
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:13,279
You are a tremendous asset.

937
00:39:13,281 --> 00:39:15,815
I have little doubt

938
00:39:15,817 --> 00:39:19,118
I will need your help again
in the future.

939
00:39:26,461 --> 00:39:28,528
Me or him?

940
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:29,996
You.

941
00:39:29,998 --> 00:39:31,798
I have an update on
that real estate flipper.

942
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,433
I thought you might
want to know.

943
00:39:39,274 --> 00:39:41,908
I tracked down the truck rental
receipts to get her name.

944
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,142
Valerie Cork.

945
00:39:43,144 --> 00:39:44,911
She's an art authenticator.

946
00:39:44,913 --> 00:39:46,779
And that crate you saw?

947
00:39:46,781 --> 00:39:48,414
There was
something called

948
00:39:48,416 --> 00:39:50,683
a scanning fluorescence
spectrometry machine inside.

949
00:39:50,685 --> 00:39:52,251
They're used...
To find paintings

950
00:39:52,253 --> 00:39:53,553
underneath other paintings.

951
00:39:53,555 --> 00:39:55,288
So it turns out
that the building

952
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:56,689
Chad Keswick was looking to buy

953
00:39:56,691 --> 00:39:59,025
was leased by the WPA
during the Depression.

954
00:39:59,027 --> 00:40:00,927
They commissioned a
mural for the lobby.

955
00:40:00,929 --> 00:40:03,329
The artist was a
notorious communist,

956
00:40:03,331 --> 00:40:05,365
so when the property passed
into private hands in the '50s,

957
00:40:05,367 --> 00:40:06,999
the new owners
had it painted over.

958
00:40:07,001 --> 00:40:08,735
But it was still there,
under the paint.

959
00:40:08,737 --> 00:40:11,037
A lost work by Diego Rivera.

960
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:13,473
It's worth ten times
the price of the building.

961
00:40:14,676 --> 00:40:17,043
I was hoping to leak
the truth to the<i> Times.</i>

962
00:40:18,113 --> 00:40:20,046
I promised you a cut of my fee.

963
00:40:20,048 --> 00:40:22,148
But I'm pretty sure
the mural's gonna end up

964
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:24,384
in the hands of
a historical trust.

965
00:40:24,386 --> 00:40:26,352
I'd feel obligated
to refund my client,

966
00:40:26,354 --> 00:40:28,388
which means you'd get
a cut of nothing.

967
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:31,457
That works for me.

968
00:40:31,459 --> 00:40:33,493
Okay.

969
00:40:35,463 --> 00:40:37,397
I think you should know

970
00:40:37,399 --> 00:40:39,732
that I am going
to a meeting tonight.

971
00:40:41,803 --> 00:40:45,505
One of those
support groups for...

972
00:40:45,507 --> 00:40:47,340
people like me.

973
00:40:47,342 --> 00:40:49,876
It was, uh, Sherlock's idea.

974
00:40:49,878 --> 00:40:51,644
That's great.

975
00:40:51,646 --> 00:40:53,446
I know you put him up to it.

976
00:40:53,448 --> 00:40:55,381
We talked.

977
00:40:57,552 --> 00:41:00,219
When he first approached me
in London,

978
00:41:00,221 --> 00:41:03,556
I was...

979
00:41:03,558 --> 00:41:05,558
in a bad way.

980
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,227
And I had been for a while.

981
00:41:08,229 --> 00:41:11,130
But then,
when he talked about

982
00:41:11,132 --> 00:41:12,365
the work that he did,

983
00:41:12,367 --> 00:41:16,035
about the things
that he saw in me...

984
00:41:18,406 --> 00:41:19,739
I want it.

985
00:41:19,741 --> 00:41:21,874
I want every bit
of what's he offered me,

986
00:41:21,876 --> 00:41:23,843
of what he offered you, but...

987
00:41:23,845 --> 00:41:26,212
if I've learned one thing
over the last few weeks,

988
00:41:26,214 --> 00:41:28,047
it's that he can't pull it off.

989
00:41:28,049 --> 00:41:29,682
Not by himself, anyway.

990
00:41:31,586 --> 00:41:34,153
And if I'm gonna get
what I want,

991
00:41:34,155 --> 00:41:37,690
then I'm going to need
your help, too.

992
00:41:40,361 --> 00:41:42,829
I still think
the meetings are bollocks,

993
00:41:42,831 --> 00:41:44,931
but you say they're important.

994
00:41:44,933 --> 00:41:47,967
They matter to you, so...

995
00:41:47,969 --> 00:41:49,735
What do you say, Watson?

996
00:41:49,737 --> 00:41:52,071
Will you help me?

997
00:41:56,277 --> 00:41:58,244
I don't know how it happened.

998
00:41:58,246 --> 00:42:01,547
It just... hit me.

999
00:42:01,549 --> 00:42:03,983
Like a truck, out of nowhere.

1000
00:42:04,853 --> 00:42:07,753
Work is good.

1001
00:42:07,755 --> 00:42:09,755
I have friends.

1002
00:42:09,757 --> 00:42:13,092
I'm in a
relationship.

1003
00:42:13,094 --> 00:42:16,896
Somewhere along
the way, somehow,

1004
00:42:16,898 --> 00:42:19,732
I stopped being a victim

1005
00:42:19,734 --> 00:42:22,602
and became a survivor.

1006
00:42:22,604 --> 00:42:25,705
So, I guess all I'm saying is,
there's hope.

1007
00:42:26,357 --> 00:42:31,686
Do the work. Love yourself.
There's hope.

<i>Previously on</i> Elementary...

2
00:00:03,422 --> 00:00:04,761
If you're looking for Sherlock,
he's downstairs.

3
00:00:04,785 --> 00:00:05,841
Okay.

4
00:00:05,842 --> 00:00:07,541
<i>His name is Harlan Emple.</i>

5
00:00:07,543 --> 00:00:09,176
<i>He is the Rachel P. Hanson</i>
<i>Professor</i>

6
00:00:09,178 --> 00:00:11,301
for Applied Mathematics
at Columbia University.

7
00:00:11,301 --> 00:00:14,502
What I don't get is
why he isn't wearing a shirt.

8
00:00:14,504 --> 00:00:17,372
He doesn't like anything to come
between him and the numbers.

9
00:00:17,374 --> 00:00:18,415
What is it?

10
00:00:18,438 --> 00:00:20,274
The answers to your questions
about Kitty.

11
00:00:20,276 --> 00:00:22,710
The truth is she was a
victim of a horrific crime.

12
00:00:22,712 --> 00:00:24,646
<i>After you left last night,</i>

13
00:00:24,648 --> 00:00:26,848
Sherlock gave me an envelope.

14
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,249
Sherlock keeps saying

15
00:00:28,251 --> 00:00:30,385
that I need to get
a better sense of you,

16
00:00:30,387 --> 00:00:33,021
and maybe that will give you
a better sense of me.

17
00:00:42,065 --> 00:00:43,065
It's open.

18
00:00:47,637 --> 00:00:49,003
It's nothing.

19
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:50,872
It's Sherlock and
one of his experts.

20
00:00:50,874 --> 00:00:52,006
Which one?

21
00:00:52,008 --> 00:00:53,241
Phillip something.

22
00:00:53,243 --> 00:00:54,575
Must be new.

23
00:00:54,577 --> 00:00:57,445
He's a knife-thrower.

24
00:00:57,447 --> 00:00:58,913
Why does Sherlock have
a knife-thrower?

25
00:00:58,915 --> 00:01:00,748
He got bored the other day,

26
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,185
started looking into this, uh,
circus accident from the '30s.

27
00:01:04,187 --> 00:01:07,922
The Great Galardo perforated one
of his assistants during an act,

28
00:01:07,924 --> 00:01:09,924
except Sherlock thinks
the blade was thrown

29
00:01:09,926 --> 00:01:11,492
by somebody in the stands,
not Galardo.

30
00:01:11,494 --> 00:01:15,096
Phillip, as far as I
can tell, disagrees.

31
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:18,900
It can't be done, okay?

32
00:01:18,902 --> 00:01:19,934
It was done.

33
00:01:19,936 --> 00:01:21,335
You're wrong.

34
00:01:21,337 --> 00:01:23,538
Nobody can chuck
a knife that far.

35
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,239
What's this?

36
00:01:25,241 --> 00:01:26,207
You're...

37
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:27,209
Not here.

38
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,509
I'm not here.

39
00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:29,711
Remember that, okay?

40
00:01:29,713 --> 00:01:31,279
Oh, yes. Heaven
forfend your work

41
00:01:31,281 --> 00:01:33,247
with me should endanger
your precious day job.

42
00:01:33,249 --> 00:01:35,116
You throw knives?

43
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,252
You know, it was supposed
to be just you here.

44
00:01:38,254 --> 00:01:41,355
Phillip is arguably the greatest
knife-thrower in the world.

45
00:01:41,357 --> 00:01:42,790
Has been for decades.

46
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:43,925
Only, there's little money

47
00:01:43,927 --> 00:01:45,193
to be made
in the impalement arts.

48
00:01:45,195 --> 00:01:46,494
So, as a youth, he turned

49
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,563
to what you Americans
term “football”"

50
00:01:48,565 --> 00:01:50,131
Is this a joke?

51
00:01:53,837 --> 00:01:55,002
Phillip, head
and heart.

52
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:56,904
Come on.
Head and heart.

53
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:06,814
Can I go?

54
00:02:06,816 --> 00:02:09,484
Yeah.

55
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,489
15 years he spent throwing
that misshapen ball around.

56
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:16,057
15 years.

57
00:02:16,059 --> 00:02:18,259
When I think of the acclaim
he could have brought

58
00:02:18,261 --> 00:02:20,828
to competitive blade slinging.

59
00:02:27,237 --> 00:02:29,036
You're following me,
Watson.

60
00:02:29,038 --> 00:02:30,338
I don't like it.

61
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,740
I want you to help
me with something.

62
00:02:32,742 --> 00:02:33,908
This is Chad Keswick.

63
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,976
He buys distressed
buildings,

64
00:02:34,978 --> 00:02:36,210
paints, spackles,

65
00:02:36,212 --> 00:02:37,645
and then flips them
for quick money.

66
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:39,180
Who'd he kill?
No one.

67
00:02:39,182 --> 00:02:41,315
I was hired by one of
his rivals to find out

68
00:02:41,317 --> 00:02:43,017
why he's been circling
this old office building

69
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:44,218
in Jamaica, Queens.

70
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,586
She wants to know
why he thinks

71
00:02:45,588 --> 00:02:47,355
the building is
a good investment.

72
00:02:47,357 --> 00:02:49,590
Is there a crime in there,
something worth investigating?

73
00:02:49,592 --> 00:02:50,925
Well, I've been
shadowing Keswick,

74
00:02:50,927 --> 00:02:52,593
but yesterday I think
he noticed me.

75
00:02:52,595 --> 00:02:54,595
I want to switch
up the tail.

76
00:02:54,597 --> 00:02:57,231
You followed me for over
a week before I noticed you.

77
00:02:57,233 --> 00:02:59,033
Help me out, and I'll
cut you in on my fee.

78
00:02:59,035 --> 00:03:02,003
I don't work for you,
I work for Sherlock.

79
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:03,437
I worked for him, too.

80
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,773
And, in my experience,
he was always supportive

81
00:03:05,775 --> 00:03:07,942
of taking on work
outside the partnership.

82
00:03:07,944 --> 00:03:10,912
Sorry, it's not my cup of tea.

83
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:33,034

♪  ♪

89
00:04:41,686 --> 00:04:45,355
Look, for the last time,
I was playing a game!

90
00:04:45,356 --> 00:04:47,456
Yeah, you called it
a puzzle hunt.

91
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,491
Belphegor's Prime.

92
00:04:50,761 --> 00:04:53,262
Think Cicada 3301
or Octorine's Challenge.

93
00:04:54,365 --> 00:04:55,631
They're math games.

94
00:04:55,633 --> 00:04:56,865
Math-- maybe you've heard of it.

95
00:04:56,867 --> 00:04:58,333
I've got some math for you.

96
00:04:58,335 --> 00:05:00,335
One dead guy
plus one live guy

97
00:05:00,337 --> 00:05:02,104
found in the same
deserted factory.

98
00:05:02,106 --> 00:05:06,108
I was not “found” there;
I am the one who called 911.

99
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,310
I was waiting there
for the police.

100
00:05:08,312 --> 00:05:09,745
Mr. Emple,

101
00:05:09,747 --> 00:05:11,613
we're just trying
to do our jobs, all right?

102
00:05:11,615 --> 00:05:13,048
First officers
on the scene described you

103
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,516
as “extremely agitated.”

104
00:05:14,518 --> 00:05:15,984
Well, of course
I was agitated.

105
00:05:15,986 --> 00:05:18,754
I had just found
a dead guy in mothballs!

106
00:05:18,756 --> 00:05:21,790
And did I mention that I have
not slept in almost two days?

107
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:23,358
Because of the math game.

108
00:05:24,762 --> 00:05:26,195
Can I borrow those?

109
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:31,100
This...

110
00:05:31,102 --> 00:05:33,302
is Belphegor's Prime, okay?

111
00:05:33,304 --> 00:05:35,304
It's a numeric palindrome.

112
00:05:35,306 --> 00:05:40,776
It's 666 bookended by 13 zeroes
and then bracketed with ones.

113
00:05:40,778 --> 00:05:43,846
Named for the demon Belphegor
who was a prince of hell.

114
00:05:43,848 --> 00:05:46,448
The first clue for the hunt
started making the rounds

115
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,883
a few months ago.

116
00:05:47,885 --> 00:05:49,651
It was a JPEG with two numbers
hidden in it.

117
00:05:49,653 --> 00:05:51,453
You divide those numbers
by Belphegor's Prime,

118
00:05:51,455 --> 00:05:54,890
and you get the GPS coordinates
for a restroom at the Bronx Zoo.

119
00:05:54,892 --> 00:05:56,959
You go to the restroom,
you find a phone number.

120
00:05:56,961 --> 00:05:58,927
You send a text to the number,
you get the next clue.

121
00:05:58,929 --> 00:05:59,962
Which is another math problem.

122
00:05:59,964 --> 00:06:00,929
Exactly.

123
00:06:00,931 --> 00:06:02,397
Only, this one is harder.

124
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,099
And that's how it works.

125
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:05,934
You know, but for
each one that you solve,

126
00:06:05,936 --> 00:06:08,103
you get a new set
of GPS coordinates.

127
00:06:08,105 --> 00:06:11,473
And that means that you've
completed a stage, or a portal.

128
00:06:11,475 --> 00:06:13,509
And last night,
I was on Portal Ten.

129
00:06:13,511 --> 00:06:15,711
And...

130
00:06:17,014 --> 00:06:18,313
You know what?

131
00:06:18,315 --> 00:06:20,015
I want to talk
to Sherlock and Joan.

132
00:06:20,017 --> 00:06:21,917
Look, Mr. Emple...
No, I'm sorry.

133
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,019
I told the police down
at the factory that I know them.

134
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:25,287
Isn't that the whole reason

135
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:26,922
that I was brought here
to this squad?

136
00:06:26,924 --> 00:06:30,392
I-I am not saying another word
until they are here.

137
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:35,264
Harlan Emple is
indeed an acquaintance.

138
00:06:35,266 --> 00:06:37,733
He is, in point of fact,
one of my “irregulars.”

139
00:06:37,735 --> 00:06:38,801
One of your what?

140
00:06:38,803 --> 00:06:40,302
Irregulars.

141
00:06:40,304 --> 00:06:41,770
I'm your consultant, Captain;
they are mine.

142
00:06:41,772 --> 00:06:43,572
They're a handful
of experts I turn to

143
00:06:43,574 --> 00:06:46,108
when I encounter problems which
are beyond my pool of knowledge.

144
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,810
Harlan is
a brilliant mathematician.

145
00:06:47,812 --> 00:06:49,778
And on the handful of occasions
I have tackled a case

146
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,046
which pertained
to mathematics...

147
00:06:51,048 --> 00:06:53,182
He helped you out.
Well, the good news

148
00:06:53,184 --> 00:06:56,018
for him is the preliminary
autopsy report just came in

149
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,252
before you got here.

150
00:06:57,254 --> 00:06:59,021
And the M.E. puts
the time of death

151
00:06:59,023 --> 00:07:00,989
between 4:00 and
6:00 p.m. last night.

152
00:07:00,991 --> 00:07:02,124
Mr. Emple was teaching

153
00:07:02,126 --> 00:07:03,358
a class at Columbia.

154
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,394
So the victim is
yet to be identified?

155
00:07:05,396 --> 00:07:07,663
No I.D., no phone.

156
00:07:07,665 --> 00:07:09,865
First detective on the scene
liked it for a mob hit,

157
00:07:09,867 --> 00:07:11,500
so while we're
running the prints,

158
00:07:11,502 --> 00:07:13,602
he's showing the vic's
face around OCID.

159
00:07:13,604 --> 00:07:16,839
Marcus here was about to walk
the scene with Mr. Emple.

160
00:07:16,841 --> 00:07:18,774
You're here now;
you might as well tag along.

161
00:07:18,776 --> 00:07:21,009
Actually, Captain,
I'm quite busy today.

162
00:07:21,011 --> 00:07:22,978
This is a John Doe,
and we got nothing.

163
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,247
And, like you just said,
you're my consultant.

164
00:07:25,249 --> 00:07:26,748
So, go consult.

165
00:07:29,787 --> 00:07:30,986
Watson.

166
00:07:30,988 --> 00:07:32,588
Um, he's your friend.

167
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,523
Actually, Kitty is
otherwise engaged,

168
00:07:34,525 --> 00:07:37,426
and he did actually help both
of us with a case last year.

169
00:07:37,428 --> 00:07:38,493
Did he not?

170
00:07:40,865 --> 00:07:44,099
Have I told you
how good it is to see you?

171
00:07:44,101 --> 00:07:45,367
Yes, you have.
Three times.

172
00:07:45,369 --> 00:07:46,468
Well, it is.

173
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,636
Hey, lousy circumstances.

174
00:07:47,638 --> 00:07:49,371
But, uh, hey...

175
00:07:49,373 --> 00:07:51,740
I heard from your boss that you
just, uh, got back from London.

176
00:07:51,742 --> 00:07:53,308
Were you working
a case or...?

177
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,576
No, I moved back there.

178
00:07:54,578 --> 00:07:55,677
You mean<i> moved,</i> moved?

179
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:56,845
Is there another
definition?

180
00:07:56,847 --> 00:07:58,513
I was there for
eight months,

181
00:07:58,515 --> 00:08:00,883
and had a change of heart
and returned to New York.

182
00:08:00,885 --> 00:08:02,517
So, you moved to London,
and you didn't, uh...

183
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,086
You know what?
Doesn't even matter.

184
00:08:04,088 --> 00:08:05,387
The point is you're back!

185
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:07,389
Mr. Emple.
Uh, duty calls.

186
00:08:07,391 --> 00:08:09,024
Yeah.

187
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:18,634
It's interesting.

188
00:08:18,636 --> 00:08:20,068
Mothballs are interesting?

189
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,070
They were taken from
that cabinet over there.

190
00:08:22,072 --> 00:08:25,941
Obviously, to cover the smell
of John Doe's decay.

191
00:08:25,943 --> 00:08:28,043
The killer didn't
bring them with him.

192
00:08:28,045 --> 00:08:31,179
Perhaps leaving the body here
was not part of his plan, hmm?

193
00:08:32,983 --> 00:08:36,018
Doe was shot in the foot
first and then the knee.

194
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,453
Either those were
two really bad misses or...

195
00:08:38,455 --> 00:08:41,256
Or the killer was torturing him.

196
00:08:41,258 --> 00:08:43,892
This doesn't seem like anything
you can't handle on your own.

197
00:08:43,894 --> 00:08:45,994
So you want to tell me why you
really asked me to come here?

198
00:08:45,996 --> 00:08:48,363
“This doesn't seem like anything
you can't handle on your own.”

199
00:08:48,365 --> 00:08:49,765
That's funny.

200
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:51,566
That's exactly what
I would have said

201
00:08:51,568 --> 00:08:53,602
had I been present when you
asked Kitty for her assistance

202
00:08:53,604 --> 00:08:54,937
with your tawdry side job.

203
00:08:54,939 --> 00:08:57,372
“Tawdry”?
I wanted you to know I approve.

204
00:08:57,374 --> 00:08:59,007
Of what?

205
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:01,376
Your agenda
with regards to Kitty.

206
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:03,078
Several days ago,
I gave you her file.

207
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,913
And then you show up at
the brownstone yesterday,

208
00:09:04,915 --> 00:09:06,515
and you invite her
into an investigation.

209
00:09:06,517 --> 00:09:08,183
Coincidence? No, I think not.

210
00:09:08,185 --> 00:09:11,320
You feel for her.
And now you wish to engage.

211
00:09:11,322 --> 00:09:13,956
It's not an outcome
I would have predicted, no.

212
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,458
But it is one
I approve of, yeah.

213
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,193
She could learn
a great deal from you,

214
00:09:18,195 --> 00:09:20,228
especially with regards
to how to get the most

215
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,864
from my tutelage.

216
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:25,734
So, I've already dispatched her
to, uh, follow your Mr. Keswick.

217
00:09:25,736 --> 00:09:27,836
But that's not
what I actually...

218
00:09:27,838 --> 00:09:29,404
Harlan!

219
00:09:30,741 --> 00:09:33,075
You came here to retrieve
a phone number, did you not?

220
00:09:33,077 --> 00:09:34,609
You would send a text,
and then receive

221
00:09:34,611 --> 00:09:36,845
the next clue in the game
that you were playing.

222
00:09:36,847 --> 00:09:38,747
Yeah, but I didn't find it.

223
00:09:38,749 --> 00:09:40,048
Not that I kept looking

224
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,250
after the dead guy
fell out of the locker.

225
00:09:42,252 --> 00:09:44,052
Yeah, CSU didn't find
any number either.

226
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:46,154
Probably because
it's under that paint.

227
00:09:46,156 --> 00:09:48,190
It's fresh.

228
00:09:48,192 --> 00:09:49,891
Applied in the last

229
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:52,694
24 hours.

230
00:09:52,696 --> 00:09:54,696
Right after John Doe's murder,
I'd wager.

231
00:09:54,698 --> 00:09:57,099
You don't think
this was a mob hit?

232
00:09:57,101 --> 00:09:59,101
Doe and the killer were
playing the game, too.

233
00:09:59,103 --> 00:10:01,203
The killer shot Doe and
then covered up the number

234
00:10:01,205 --> 00:10:02,704
so no one else could use it.

235
00:10:02,706 --> 00:10:04,806
What's the prize
in your little contest?

236
00:10:04,808 --> 00:10:07,576
Well, I'm doing it
mostly for the math.

237
00:10:07,578 --> 00:10:11,480
But, uh, $1,707,071.

238
00:10:11,482 --> 00:10:13,882
It's another
palindromic prime.

239
00:10:13,884 --> 00:10:17,152
Did I not mention the
money at the station?

240
00:10:17,154 --> 00:10:18,587
Who the hell can afford

241
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:20,655
that kind of payout
for a puzzle hunt?

242
00:10:20,657 --> 00:10:22,124
Well, most people
think it's CAML.

243
00:10:22,126 --> 00:10:24,593
The Center for Applied
Mathematics and Logic.

244
00:10:24,595 --> 00:10:26,094
It's located
in Ramapo...

245
00:10:26,096 --> 00:10:27,729
Wait, most people
“think” it's them?

246
00:10:27,731 --> 00:10:29,331
Well, hunts like these,

247
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,266
the organizers are
almost always anonymous.

248
00:10:31,268 --> 00:10:32,401
It's S.O.P.

249
00:10:32,403 --> 00:10:34,302
What about the
contestants?

250
00:10:34,304 --> 00:10:37,005
Is anonymity
also S.O.P.?

251
00:10:37,007 --> 00:10:39,207
For the most part, yeah.

252
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:43,078
But, guys, math peeps
are my peeps, okay?

253
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,314
It's, uh, like
a community, sort of.

254
00:10:46,316 --> 00:10:48,984
I can think of ten
or 12 other people

255
00:10:48,986 --> 00:10:50,018
who were probably competing.

256
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,186
Would that help?

257
00:10:53,157 --> 00:10:55,223
No.

258
00:10:55,225 --> 00:10:58,026
I'm sorry, I don't know him.

259
00:10:58,028 --> 00:11:00,862
But you admit you were
competing in Belphegor's Prime.

260
00:11:00,864 --> 00:11:02,197
I do.

261
00:11:04,835 --> 00:11:05,934
Pepe!

262
00:11:08,172 --> 00:11:10,439
Sorry. He doesn't
like strangers.

263
00:11:12,109 --> 00:11:14,443
Give him one of these.

264
00:11:14,445 --> 00:11:16,111
Get on his good side.

265
00:11:24,288 --> 00:11:26,354
What are you doing?

266
00:11:28,225 --> 00:11:30,725
I'm just verifying that
you've been lying to us.

267
00:11:30,727 --> 00:11:33,895
You did know the
dead man, did you not?

268
00:11:33,897 --> 00:11:36,998
I reviewed his personal
effects at the morgue earlier.

269
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,034
The coroner reported finding
crumbs in one of his pockets.

270
00:11:39,036 --> 00:11:40,036
I tasted one.

271
00:11:40,037 --> 00:11:41,269
Why would you...?

272
00:11:41,271 --> 00:11:42,771
At first, I thought
they were from

273
00:11:42,773 --> 00:11:44,439
a particularly rancid
brand of cheese,

274
00:11:44,441 --> 00:11:47,609
but, no... they're from
one of Pepe's treats.

275
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:49,277
Homemade?

276
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,481
Harlan was able to give us
the names of nine other people

277
00:11:52,483 --> 00:11:54,149
he believed to be
other competitors.

278
00:11:54,151 --> 00:11:55,984
Our colleagues are
investigating them as we speak,

279
00:11:55,986 --> 00:11:57,919
but I'll quite happily
recommend that the NYPD

280
00:11:57,921 --> 00:12:00,222
focus its attention
entirely on you.

281
00:12:04,128 --> 00:12:06,428
His name was Ike Walaczek.

282
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,231
In another lifetime,
he was my boyfriend.

283
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:10,866
And what of
this lifetime?

284
00:12:10,868 --> 00:12:12,701
We were working together.

285
00:12:12,703 --> 00:12:14,769
On Belphegor's.
What?!

286
00:12:14,771 --> 00:12:16,705
He was a numerical analyst
at the Tory Foundation.

287
00:12:16,707 --> 00:12:17,873
I work mostly in combinatorics.

288
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,307
I thought we would make
a good team.

289
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:20,742
But there aren't
supposed to be teams.

290
00:12:20,744 --> 00:12:22,711
Not in a puzzle hunt.
It's bad form.

291
00:12:22,713 --> 00:12:23,713
Harlan...

292
00:12:23,714 --> 00:12:25,514
I'm just saying...

293
00:12:25,516 --> 00:12:27,315
My husband
wouldn't understand,

294
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:30,385
so I decided I wouldn't tell him
until after we won the money.

295
00:12:30,387 --> 00:12:33,121
A team-- so that's how
you got there before me.

296
00:12:33,123 --> 00:12:34,489
I wasn't there.

297
00:12:34,491 --> 00:12:36,258
Tom and I were out of town
until this morning.

298
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,126
His cousin
was getting married in Hawaii.

299
00:12:38,128 --> 00:12:40,662
That's why Ike went
to the coordinates by himself.

300
00:12:40,664 --> 00:12:42,097
Because I couldn't.

301
00:12:44,268 --> 00:12:46,601
These are pictures I took.

302
00:12:46,603 --> 00:12:49,337
Check the dates.

303
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:51,506
You gave the police
nine other names?

304
00:12:51,508 --> 00:12:53,408
People you thought
were competing?

305
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,776
I've got 16.

306
00:12:54,778 --> 00:12:56,311
And I know they were competing.

307
00:12:58,448 --> 00:13:01,249
He talked to her
outside the Jamaica property

308
00:13:01,251 --> 00:13:05,720
for about 20 minutes,
and then this truck rolled up.

309
00:13:05,722 --> 00:13:07,822
Any idea what's
inside the crate?

310
00:13:07,824 --> 00:13:09,024
Nope.

311
00:13:09,026 --> 00:13:10,392
I can't identify
the woman either.

312
00:13:10,394 --> 00:13:12,260
Everything about her
said money though.

313
00:13:12,262 --> 00:13:15,363
She, Keswick
and the mystery box

314
00:13:15,365 --> 00:13:17,732
stayed inside the building
for about three hours,

315
00:13:17,734 --> 00:13:20,001
and then off they went.

316
00:13:20,904 --> 00:13:22,170
Good.

317
00:13:22,172 --> 00:13:23,872
Okay.

318
00:13:23,874 --> 00:13:26,074
You know where
to send the check.

319
00:13:26,076 --> 00:13:30,145
You haven't asked me about
the file Sherlock gave me.

320
00:13:30,147 --> 00:13:32,080
Why would I?

321
00:13:32,082 --> 00:13:36,184
You said it would give me
a better sense of you-- it did.

322
00:13:37,588 --> 00:13:40,155
That's why you asked
for my help.

323
00:13:40,157 --> 00:13:41,990
Because you felt sorry for me.

324
00:13:41,992 --> 00:13:44,226
No.

325
00:13:44,228 --> 00:13:46,194
You just don't seem interested
in anything

326
00:13:46,196 --> 00:13:48,063
outside of becoming
a detective.

327
00:13:48,065 --> 00:13:50,999
There she is.

328
00:13:51,001 --> 00:13:53,301
The old counselor.

329
00:13:53,303 --> 00:13:55,637
Who used to hold
Sherlock's hand.

330
00:13:57,608 --> 00:13:59,741
Everything that you read,

331
00:13:59,743 --> 00:14:02,510
everything that happened to me,
that's all it is.

332
00:14:02,512 --> 00:14:04,646
It's just something
that happened.

333
00:14:04,648 --> 00:14:08,116
And it's all
in the past now.

334
00:14:08,118 --> 00:14:10,685
So let's just
leave it there, shall we?

335
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:24,667
Hello.

336
00:14:24,668 --> 00:14:26,001
You've had sex.

337
00:14:26,003 --> 00:14:27,202
Excuse me?

338
00:14:27,204 --> 00:14:28,503
I can hear it
in your voice.

339
00:14:28,505 --> 00:14:29,771
You've joined paunches.

340
00:14:29,773 --> 00:14:30,972
Good for you, Watson.

341
00:14:30,974 --> 00:14:32,807
As you know, I think
the act of love

342
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:34,676
can be quite conducive to...
What do you want?

343
00:14:34,678 --> 00:14:36,911
Merely to apprise you
of a new development

344
00:14:36,913 --> 00:14:38,280
in the murder of
Ike Walaczek.

345
00:14:38,282 --> 00:14:40,115
As I informed
you yesterday,

346
00:14:40,117 --> 00:14:42,284
Harlan and I were given
a new list of competitors.

347
00:14:42,286 --> 00:14:45,320
One name leapt out:
Byron Lowenthal.

348
00:14:45,322 --> 00:14:48,156
He's a statistician at the
Public Utilities Commission

349
00:14:48,158 --> 00:14:50,425
and a diagnosed
paranoid schizophrenic.

350
00:14:50,427 --> 00:14:52,160
He's been hospitalized
for becoming violent

351
00:14:52,162 --> 00:14:53,728
on no fewer
than three occasions.

352
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,964
Certainly sounds like
it could be our guy.

353
00:14:55,966 --> 00:14:59,367
Unfortunately, Mr. Lowenthal had
another break earlier this year.

354
00:14:59,369 --> 00:15:02,137
He's been staying in
a transient hotel ever since.

355
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:04,239
Detective Bell and I
are going to speak with him.

356
00:15:04,241 --> 00:15:05,307
You want me to meet you?

357
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:06,875
Oh, no, we're already here.

358
00:15:06,877 --> 00:15:08,410
Anyway, now that I know
that you've enjoyed coitus

359
00:15:08,412 --> 00:15:09,778
and could enjoy more
in the near future...

360
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,846
When you're done,
we need to talk.

361
00:15:14,718 --> 00:15:16,818
Byron Lowenthal,
you in there?

362
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,053
Who is it?

363
00:15:18,055 --> 00:15:19,754
It's Detective Bell, NYPD.

364
00:15:19,756 --> 00:15:22,257
My colleague and I would like
to ask you some questions.

365
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:24,592
Let me
get some pants on.

366
00:15:37,341 --> 00:15:40,008
S-Sorry, I just... I, um...

367
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,310
I-I thought I heard
Mr. Lowenthal retr...

368
00:16:19,154 --> 00:16:21,267
You guys got lucky.

369
00:16:21,268 --> 00:16:22,868
Well, luck had little
to do with it, actually.

370
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,536
I... I heard Mr. Lowenthal

371
00:16:24,538 --> 00:16:27,039
pulling a heavy object off
a shelf, placing it on his bed,

372
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,041
and the sound of
the zipper indicated

373
00:16:29,043 --> 00:16:30,976
that it was
a large gun case.

374
00:16:30,978 --> 00:16:33,579
Looks like he was sane enough
to do math, but not much else.

375
00:16:33,581 --> 00:16:34,747
Plus, he was
pretty hopped up.

376
00:16:34,749 --> 00:16:36,448
Caffeine pills,
energy drinks,

377
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,251
pretty much every legal
stimulant you can buy.

378
00:16:39,253 --> 00:16:40,853
Plus a few illegal ones.

379
00:16:40,855 --> 00:16:42,821
Hmm. Obviously, he was
keeping himself awake

380
00:16:42,823 --> 00:16:44,490
so he could work on
Belphegor's.

381
00:16:44,492 --> 00:16:47,392
This... is obvious to you?

382
00:16:47,394 --> 00:16:48,961
I confess the maths
are beyond me,

383
00:16:48,963 --> 00:16:51,130
but I took the liberty of
sending pictures of what

384
00:16:51,132 --> 00:16:52,865
appear to be Mr. Lowenthal's
most recent scribbles

385
00:16:52,867 --> 00:16:54,166
to Harlan Emple,
and he's confirmed

386
00:16:54,168 --> 00:16:55,667
they are part of the contest.

387
00:16:55,669 --> 00:16:56,969
With your permission,
I'd like copies of these

388
00:16:56,971 --> 00:16:58,837
sent to my home
so he can review them.

389
00:16:58,839 --> 00:16:59,972
What for?

390
00:16:59,974 --> 00:17:01,073
If Byron Lowenthal

391
00:17:01,075 --> 00:17:02,441
did kill Ike Walaczek,

392
00:17:02,443 --> 00:17:04,109
then he used
and obscured a phone number,

393
00:17:04,111 --> 00:17:05,878
which would have yielded
the next problem.

394
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,379
That problem's solution

395
00:17:07,381 --> 00:17:08,714
would be GPS coordinates.

396
00:17:08,716 --> 00:17:10,415
If he's recorded them
in his books...

397
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:12,551
Your pal will be able to tell us
where he's headed next.

398
00:17:12,553 --> 00:17:14,853
I'll get our guys to give you

399
00:17:14,855 --> 00:17:16,388
whatever you need.

400
00:17:17,258 --> 00:17:18,991
Scans are still coming through,

401
00:17:18,993 --> 00:17:21,260
but I've put what we've got
so far up on the wall.

402
00:17:21,262 --> 00:17:23,262
Sherlock said that
you prefer it that way.

403
00:17:23,264 --> 00:17:25,030
Picked it up from him,
actually.

404
00:17:25,032 --> 00:17:28,600
Makes me feel like I'm really
inside of the problem.

405
00:17:30,704 --> 00:17:33,372
I'll, uh, let you know
if I need anything.

406
00:17:34,275 --> 00:17:35,974
Oh, I work without a shirt.

407
00:17:35,976 --> 00:17:38,911
Sometimes makes me feel
closer to the numbers.

408
00:17:38,913 --> 00:17:42,147
You'll need to, uh,
check the printer in the study

409
00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:43,615
for more pages.

410
00:17:43,617 --> 00:17:45,417
Uh, this is nice,
you know?

411
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:47,452
Meeting another member
of the team.

412
00:17:47,454 --> 00:17:48,654
You know, Team Sherlock.

413
00:17:48,656 --> 00:17:50,656
You help him, I help him...

414
00:17:51,926 --> 00:17:53,559
Obviously, you haven't
tackled a case

415
00:17:53,561 --> 00:17:55,093
with high-order math since
you started working with him,

416
00:17:55,095 --> 00:17:57,729
or we would've...

417
00:17:57,731 --> 00:17:59,031
What?

418
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:00,232
What?

419
00:18:00,234 --> 00:18:01,834
Wait...

420
00:18:01,836 --> 00:18:04,002
have you worked a case
with high-order math?

421
00:18:04,805 --> 00:18:06,238
You have, haven't you?

422
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,840
Does it matter?

423
00:18:07,842 --> 00:18:09,842
Of course it...

424
00:18:09,844 --> 00:18:11,443
Oh, my God.

425
00:18:11,445 --> 00:18:13,278
Did he fire me?

426
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,980
All I know
is that back in London,

427
00:18:14,982 --> 00:18:16,982
we worked a case that involved
Fibonacci spirals...

428
00:18:16,984 --> 00:18:18,483
He fired me.

429
00:18:18,485 --> 00:18:21,386
...and he called some woman
named Indira Patel.

430
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,856
She's at Berkeley.

431
00:18:23,858 --> 00:18:25,624
I'm three time zones closer!

432
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:27,125
You're here now.

433
00:18:27,127 --> 00:18:29,428
Sure, because I found
a dead body.

434
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,531
I have to go; I have to run
some errands for Sherlock.

435
00:18:35,936 --> 00:18:37,903
I-I don't know
what was in the crate,

436
00:18:37,905 --> 00:18:39,271
but the stenciling on
the side indicates

437
00:18:39,273 --> 00:18:40,772
it came from one of
the SUNY schools.

438
00:18:40,774 --> 00:18:42,908
I put another detective
on Keswick...

439
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:45,177
Don't kill me, I had to
use your razor to shave.

440
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:47,179
I...

441
00:18:47,181 --> 00:18:49,147
You must be Andrew.

442
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:50,515
Sherlock Holmes.

443
00:18:50,517 --> 00:18:52,551
Sorry.

444
00:18:52,553 --> 00:18:55,487
Joan said you were coming;
I... I forgot.

445
00:18:55,489 --> 00:18:57,122
It's not how
I wanted to meet you.

446
00:18:57,124 --> 00:18:58,891
She said you can tell
a lot about people

447
00:18:58,893 --> 00:19:00,192
just by looking at them.

448
00:19:00,194 --> 00:19:02,261
I swear, I...
usually wear pants.

449
00:19:02,263 --> 00:19:03,729
Well, in my experience,
most people

450
00:19:03,731 --> 00:19:05,264
need only be concerned
I won't notice

451
00:19:05,266 --> 00:19:06,498
anything worth remarking upon.

452
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:10,535
Watson seems adequately sexed.

453
00:19:11,939 --> 00:19:13,672
Hey.

454
00:19:13,674 --> 00:19:15,674
I was just introducing myself.

455
00:19:17,945 --> 00:19:20,379
I've got that thing.
I'll see you tonight.

456
00:19:20,381 --> 00:19:21,580
Okay.

457
00:19:27,855 --> 00:19:30,188
Your home, Watson...

458
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,823
it's utterly pleasant.

459
00:19:31,825 --> 00:19:33,692
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

460
00:19:33,694 --> 00:19:35,394
When you told me
you wanted a life of your own,

461
00:19:35,396 --> 00:19:36,595
I didn't realize
that you meant you wanted

462
00:19:36,597 --> 00:19:38,030
the same life everyone else has.

463
00:19:38,032 --> 00:19:39,464
But at any rate,
none of my business, is it?

464
00:19:39,466 --> 00:19:41,233
It's not.
And I didn't ask you here

465
00:19:41,235 --> 00:19:42,634
to talk about my apartment.

466
00:19:42,636 --> 00:19:44,970
No, you asked me here
to discuss Kitty.

467
00:19:44,972 --> 00:19:46,471
If she were not
the topic of conversation,

468
00:19:46,473 --> 00:19:48,941
then you wouldn't have
invited me to your home,

469
00:19:48,943 --> 00:19:50,776
where there's no chance
she'll be present.

470
00:19:52,346 --> 00:19:53,946
She disappointed you
in some way.

471
00:19:53,948 --> 00:19:55,247
Skills not up to snuff?

472
00:19:55,249 --> 00:19:57,316
Please remember
she is a novice.

473
00:19:57,318 --> 00:19:58,850
Actually, she did a great job.

474
00:19:58,852 --> 00:20:00,285
But I have some concerns.

475
00:20:00,287 --> 00:20:01,954
I thought we could
talk about them.

476
00:20:03,757 --> 00:20:04,923
You think that
Kitty needs help

477
00:20:04,925 --> 00:20:06,091
above and beyond
my mentorship.

478
00:20:06,093 --> 00:20:07,392
You read the same
file I did.

479
00:20:07,394 --> 00:20:08,894
She's a rape victim.

480
00:20:08,896 --> 00:20:11,296
She was kept and tortured.

481
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,899
Mm.

482
00:20:16,136 --> 00:20:19,171
You know me, so surely you know

483
00:20:19,173 --> 00:20:22,874
I've broached the subject of
a support group meeting before.

484
00:20:22,876 --> 00:20:25,010
Even offered
to pay for therapy.

485
00:20:25,012 --> 00:20:26,812
She's not interested, I know.

486
00:20:26,814 --> 00:20:28,447
Just as you also know

487
00:20:28,449 --> 00:20:30,749
someone with a problem
can't be forced to get help.

488
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:32,551
They have to want it.

489
00:20:32,553 --> 00:20:34,786
What Kitty wants
is to be a detective.

490
00:20:36,523 --> 00:20:38,490
I am taking pains
to try and channel

491
00:20:38,492 --> 00:20:40,592
her residual feelings
into her work.

492
00:20:42,329 --> 00:20:44,463
Well, that works out
great for you.

493
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:48,400
You told me that
you took on a partner

494
00:20:48,402 --> 00:20:50,635
because you wanted to replicate
what you and I had.

495
00:20:50,637 --> 00:20:52,637
That you thought it helped
with your recovery.

496
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:54,539
You think I would
try and take advantage

497
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,208
of the victim of a trauma?

498
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,910
Of course not, but there is
a conflict of interest here.

499
00:20:58,912 --> 00:21:02,447
She needs what she needs,
but you need what you need, too.

500
00:21:06,053 --> 00:21:10,055
It's-it's good that you're
in her life now, Watson.

501
00:21:10,057 --> 00:21:12,524
I mean,
it's commonly believed that, um,

502
00:21:12,526 --> 00:21:16,228
a child benefits mostly from
the presence of two parents.

503
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,164
He-- or she, in this case--
can absorb certain qualities

504
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,466
from the father--
clear-eyed view of the world,

505
00:21:21,468 --> 00:21:23,168
capacity of
rational thought, etcetera.

506
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,170
They can also absorb certain
qualities from the mother.

507
00:21:25,172 --> 00:21:27,105
Excuse me, but I am not
Kitty's mother,

508
00:21:27,107 --> 00:21:28,807
and she sure as hell
is not our child.

509
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:30,942
You brought her here;
she looks up to you.

510
00:21:30,944 --> 00:21:32,944
She says that she doesn't
need help-- fine--

511
00:21:32,946 --> 00:21:34,579
but you know better.

512
00:21:34,581 --> 00:21:37,082
And you're gonna have to be
the one that tells her.

513
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,620
It's Harlan.

514
00:21:41,622 --> 00:21:44,523
Making progress with the maths.

515
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,660
We thought
that Byron and Ike

516
00:21:48,662 --> 00:21:50,462
arrived at Portal Ten
simultaneously.

517
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,664
That would've meant that they
were doing all the same math

518
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,032
at essentially
the same time.

519
00:21:54,034 --> 00:21:56,001
Only, the math
you found at Byron's place

520
00:21:56,003 --> 00:21:57,003
says that's wrong.

521
00:21:57,004 --> 00:21:58,470
He was one step behind Ike.

522
00:21:58,472 --> 00:22:00,705
Are you proposing he did
not kill Mr. Walaczek?

523
00:22:00,707 --> 00:22:03,175
I don't know, but that's
not the weirdest part.

524
00:22:03,177 --> 00:22:04,810
Byron was obsessive.

525
00:22:04,812 --> 00:22:06,211
He time-stamped
almost everything he did.

526
00:22:06,213 --> 00:22:09,047
He only solved
the Portal Nine problem,

527
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:11,316
the same problem that sent me
to that old factory last night.

528
00:22:11,318 --> 00:22:12,884
But get this--

529
00:22:12,886 --> 00:22:14,686
he wasn't given
the same problem as me.

530
00:22:14,688 --> 00:22:16,655
And so it would've yielded
GPS coordinates

531
00:22:16,657 --> 00:22:18,323
for an entirely
different location.

532
00:22:18,325 --> 00:22:21,760
The person in charge of
the game changed the clue

533
00:22:21,762 --> 00:22:23,328
after the police
found Ike's body.

534
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:25,964
Well, he had to, right?

535
00:22:25,966 --> 00:22:27,899
If he hadn't, he would be
sending other competitors

536
00:22:27,901 --> 00:22:29,101
to an active crime scene.

537
00:22:29,103 --> 00:22:30,402
The important thing is

538
00:22:30,404 --> 00:22:31,536
I figured out the coordinates

539
00:22:31,538 --> 00:22:32,771
to the second location.

540
00:22:32,773 --> 00:22:35,540
I know where Byron went.

541
00:22:35,542 --> 00:22:36,842
What are you doing?

542
00:22:36,844 --> 00:22:38,410
You're saying he
time-stamped everything.

543
00:22:38,412 --> 00:22:40,345
I'm looking at the time
he received his clues.

544
00:22:40,347 --> 00:22:42,647
It's all there, to the second,
but what does that have to do...

545
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:44,149
What if you hadn't
found a body?

546
00:22:44,151 --> 00:22:46,118
If the game had
proceeded as planned,

547
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,486
what were you meant
to do there?

548
00:22:47,488 --> 00:22:49,354
I would have sent a text
to the phone number,

549
00:22:49,356 --> 00:22:51,523
the one that the killer painted
over, and then I would have

550
00:22:51,525 --> 00:22:52,891
gotten a message back
with the next problem.

551
00:22:52,893 --> 00:22:54,559
There's an extra
step in there.

552
00:22:54,561 --> 00:22:56,428
Why all this rigmarole with
phone numbers and texts?

553
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,064
Why not just post the problem
itself at the factory?

554
00:22:59,066 --> 00:23:02,100
I don't know, it's just the way
the game is played.

555
00:23:02,102 --> 00:23:04,102
They're for an old
industrial area in Queens.

556
00:23:04,104 --> 00:23:06,805
You're welcome
for finding your suspect.

557
00:23:06,807 --> 00:23:09,207
If I'm right, Harlan,
what you've found...

558
00:23:09,209 --> 00:23:11,109
is the site of
another murder.

559
00:23:11,111 --> 00:23:13,245
Byron Lowenthal's.

560
00:23:15,983 --> 00:23:18,216
You were right,
Lowenthal's dead.

561
00:23:18,218 --> 00:23:20,952
He was shot in the foot,
then the knee.

562
00:23:20,954 --> 00:23:22,821
Just like
Ike Wallaczek.

563
00:23:22,823 --> 00:23:26,391
I'm, uh, gonna look
over here now.

564
00:23:26,393 --> 00:23:29,427
Well, we think the perp
was pulling the body

565
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:31,429
to a car that was parked
over there.

566
00:23:31,431 --> 00:23:34,065
Then he just
left him here.

567
00:23:34,067 --> 00:23:35,901
Probably afraid
he'd been spotted.

568
00:23:35,903 --> 00:23:38,803
There's a lot
of homeless in the area.

569
00:23:41,441 --> 00:23:43,008
Question is:

570
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:45,010
how'd you know
Lowenthal was the next victim

571
00:23:45,012 --> 00:23:46,511
and not the killer?

572
00:23:49,316 --> 00:23:51,750
Well, that's
quite simple, really.

573
00:23:51,752 --> 00:23:54,352
The game is directing
its players to remote locales,

574
00:23:54,354 --> 00:23:56,788
and then instructing them
to send a text message

575
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,256
indicating their presence.

576
00:23:58,258 --> 00:24:00,125
I suspect the killer wanted
to remove the body

577
00:24:00,127 --> 00:24:02,928
so he could keep this new
location “in play,” so to speak.

578
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:05,130
Still missing the “simple” part.

579
00:24:05,132 --> 00:24:06,698
The late Mr. Lowenthal

580
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,366
received his final clue

581
00:24:08,368 --> 00:24:10,235
after Harlan discovered
Ike Wallaczek's body,

582
00:24:10,237 --> 00:24:12,737
but before news of the killing
had reached the media.

583
00:24:12,739 --> 00:24:14,439
That means the
game's designer

584
00:24:14,441 --> 00:24:16,408
knew the location
had been compromised.

585
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,577
And the only way
that he could have known that,

586
00:24:18,579 --> 00:24:20,111
at the time that he knew it,

587
00:24:20,113 --> 00:24:21,880
was if he, himself,
was the killer.

588
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,917
Belphegor's Prime is not
a treasure hunt.

589
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,619
It's a trap.

590
00:24:40,696 --> 00:24:42,196
Better?

591
00:24:42,198 --> 00:24:44,665
False alarm.

592
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:47,668
But I still feel
a little queasy.

593
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,273
This new dead guy--

594
00:24:52,275 --> 00:24:54,875
your friend said that he was
tortured, too, right?

595
00:24:54,877 --> 00:24:57,244
Right before the killer tried
to abscond with his corpse.

596
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:59,213
I assume
he intended to take

597
00:24:59,215 --> 00:25:02,383
Ike Wallaczek away with him
as well, only Ike was too large.

598
00:25:02,385 --> 00:25:04,685
A speedy mothballing
was the best he could do.

599
00:25:04,687 --> 00:25:07,221
So, just to recap,

600
00:25:07,223 --> 00:25:09,657
I've spent the last
few months of my life

601
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:13,360
playing a game that was
designed to kill me.

602
00:25:13,362 --> 00:25:15,629
Got to be a metaphor
in there somewhere, right?

603
00:25:15,631 --> 00:25:18,966
I think the word you're
looking for is “moral.”

604
00:25:18,968 --> 00:25:21,902
There is a moral in there:
games are for idiots.

605
00:25:24,707 --> 00:25:26,473
Breaking news from Ramapo.

606
00:25:26,475 --> 00:25:29,443
Kitty reports the Center for
Applied Mathematics and Logic

607
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,912
is not the sponsor
of Belphegor's Prime.

608
00:25:31,914 --> 00:25:34,148
Then it's got to be
a serial killer, right?

609
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,716
Someone who's obsessed
with mathematicians?

610
00:25:35,718 --> 00:25:37,284
Mm.

611
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,920
Perhaps he was bullied
by mathematicians as a child.

612
00:25:39,922 --> 00:25:42,056
Or mathematicians
killed his parents.

613
00:25:42,058 --> 00:25:43,657
I'm being serious.

614
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:45,726
Serial killers who devise
elaborate death traps

615
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,461
are the stuff of pulp fiction.

616
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:49,229
And besides, with respect
to these murders,

617
00:25:49,231 --> 00:25:51,165
there are none
of the elaborations

618
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:53,767
which mark that sort of culprit.

619
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:55,970
If anything, I would describe
the work as businesslike.

620
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:58,172
Then it's the government.

621
00:25:58,174 --> 00:26:01,241
I mean, the-the game was some
sort of test to weed out people

622
00:26:01,243 --> 00:26:03,243
who could weaponize math.

623
00:26:03,245 --> 00:26:05,179
The American intelligence
apparatus may be clod-like,

624
00:26:05,181 --> 00:26:07,014
but I think they would
do a better job

625
00:26:07,016 --> 00:26:08,749
of disposing of two bodies,
don't you?

626
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:11,785
Watson?

627
00:26:11,787 --> 00:26:13,621
I just heard
from one of the suspects

628
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:14,922
Marcus and I talked to
yesterday,

629
00:26:14,924 --> 00:26:16,290
another puzzle-hunter.

630
00:26:16,292 --> 00:26:18,525
Tell me he confessed
to the murders.

631
00:26:18,527 --> 00:26:20,427
We ruled him out right away,
but he heard about

632
00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:22,329
Byron Lowenthal's murder on
the news and wanted me to know

633
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:25,165
he's at a friend's place,
some guy named Paul.

634
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,934
That is fascinating.

635
00:26:26,936 --> 00:26:28,369
Actually, it might be.

636
00:26:28,371 --> 00:26:31,038
Paul is positive he knows
who the killer is.

637
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,807
I know the guards
are a bit much,

638
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:35,509
but I wanted everyone
to feel safe.

639
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:38,178
And, besides,
math has been good to me.

640
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,279
Commodities.

641
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:40,848
So, you and your friends,

642
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:43,150
you were competitors
in Belphegor's Prime?

643
00:26:43,152 --> 00:26:45,352
Most of us. Some of the others
are just here for the math.

644
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,121
You said you could
identify the killer.

645
00:26:47,123 --> 00:26:49,323
I can, sort of.

646
00:26:52,061 --> 00:26:54,194
“Mo Shellshocker.”

647
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:56,930
It's a pseudonym,
obviously, but I'm telling you,

648
00:26:56,932 --> 00:26:58,365
this is the guy
you're looking for.

649
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,600
I've heard of him.

650
00:26:59,602 --> 00:27:01,335
He uses his blog
to expose bad math.

651
00:27:01,337 --> 00:27:03,837
Corrupt economists, biased
pollsters, that sort of thing.

652
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:05,572
He's actually
sort of a crusader.

653
00:27:05,574 --> 00:27:06,574
He's a murderer.

654
00:27:06,575 --> 00:27:09,143
How can you be
so sure?

655
00:27:09,145 --> 00:27:10,744
When he isn't crusading,
he's competing in puzzle hunts.

656
00:27:10,746 --> 00:27:11,812
A few months ago,

657
00:27:11,814 --> 00:27:13,080
he claimed to
have solved

658
00:27:13,082 --> 00:27:14,815
Cicada 3301 two
years in a row.

659
00:27:14,817 --> 00:27:17,484
Some people called BS,
including...

660
00:27:17,486 --> 00:27:20,120
Ike Wallaczek
and Byron Lowenthal.

661
00:27:20,122 --> 00:27:21,221
“WallaCheckYourMath,”

662
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:22,489
“ByLow2020.”

663
00:27:22,491 --> 00:27:23,757
Those are their
online handles.

664
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:25,392
Their friends
will confirm it.

665
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,528
A flame war does not
a murderer make.

666
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:30,097
The stuff these guys were
slinging at each other was ugly.

667
00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:32,099
Mo knew they were into hunts,
and so he built one

668
00:27:32,101 --> 00:27:34,034
that would send them to places
where he could kill them.

669
00:27:34,036 --> 00:27:35,469
That's what we're
doing here is

670
00:27:35,471 --> 00:27:36,837
we're just sifting
through all the math

671
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:38,338
he's posted on his blog
over the years,

672
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,840
to see if we could
find his signature

673
00:27:39,842 --> 00:27:41,975
or something that
could identify him.

674
00:27:41,977 --> 00:27:45,279
If two people weren't dead,
we'd probably be having fun.

675
00:27:45,281 --> 00:27:46,747
But still, the
chances that he left

676
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:48,582
something like that
in his math...

677
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,784
If it's there, we'll find it.
In the meantime,

678
00:27:50,786 --> 00:27:52,186
we thought the
police should know

679
00:27:52,188 --> 00:27:53,687
who they're really
dealing with.

680
00:27:53,689 --> 00:27:55,389
<i>I've got to go meet someone</i>

681
00:27:55,391 --> 00:27:56,924
about my other case.

682
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:59,927
You're good to pass all this
along to Marcus? Okay.

683
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:03,030
I must say, I'm surprised you
didn't offer to stay and help.

684
00:28:03,032 --> 00:28:05,265
Mr. Ettinger makes
a compelling case with respect

685
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,067
to Mo Shellshocker's
viability as a suspect.

686
00:28:07,069 --> 00:28:09,002
Mo is a genius.

687
00:28:09,004 --> 00:28:10,637
We're talking off the charts.

688
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:12,139
Leibniz meets Euler meets Gauss.

689
00:28:12,141 --> 00:28:14,108
Huh.
He may have an ego,

690
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,110
but he's not gonna kill
anyone over a few comments.

691
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:18,312
So, while “The League of
Concerned Mathematician”"

692
00:28:18,314 --> 00:28:21,014
chases its tail up there, I
am gonna do the smart thing

693
00:28:21,016 --> 00:28:22,416
and get out of town.

694
00:28:22,418 --> 00:28:24,485
You can let me know
when it all blows over.

695
00:28:24,487 --> 00:28:26,386
You're not going
anywhere, Harlan.

696
00:28:26,388 --> 00:28:29,223
Or should I call you
Mo Shellshocker?

697
00:28:32,728 --> 00:28:34,661
Did you honestly think
I wouldn't recognize

698
00:28:34,663 --> 00:28:36,130
an anagram of my own name?

699
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:40,567
I knew I should've gone
with “Choker Hell Moss”"

700
00:28:40,569 --> 00:28:42,569
But I never thought
that you would see it, okay?

701
00:28:42,571 --> 00:28:44,104
Math is my thing, not yours.

702
00:28:44,106 --> 00:28:46,473
It's my name, Harlan;
that makes it my thing.

703
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,675
It was an homage.

704
00:28:48,677 --> 00:28:50,043
Explain.

705
00:28:50,045 --> 00:28:52,045
Every day, all over the world,

706
00:28:52,047 --> 00:28:54,348
math is used to trick people.

707
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,917
Data dredging to sell
pharmaceuticals.

708
00:28:56,919 --> 00:28:59,720
Publication bias
to justify wars.

709
00:28:59,722 --> 00:29:02,322
In the wrong hands, math can be
manipulated, abused.

710
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:05,425
And I decided to do
something about it.

711
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:09,596
You catch people
who murder other people.

712
00:29:09,598 --> 00:29:11,431
I catch people who murder math.

713
00:29:11,433 --> 00:29:14,568
According to this,
Mo is a wanted man.

714
00:29:17,606 --> 00:29:19,940
Harlan?

715
00:29:19,942 --> 00:29:23,110
The D.O.D. was working
on a new fighter.

716
00:29:23,112 --> 00:29:27,047
Only, I knew that the
performance stats were bogus.

717
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:29,116
A friend of mine found
the internal numbers,

718
00:29:29,118 --> 00:29:31,251
and I sort of published them.

719
00:29:31,253 --> 00:29:33,320
So you put classified
Department of Defense documents

720
00:29:33,322 --> 00:29:34,888
on the Internet.

721
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:36,623
Isn't that what
you would have done?

722
00:29:38,928 --> 00:29:41,562
Fine! I screwed up, okay?

723
00:29:41,564 --> 00:29:43,730
But, hey, that's what I do,
right? I screw up.

724
00:29:43,732 --> 00:29:46,233
If I didn't, then probably you
wouldn't have secretly fired me.

725
00:29:46,235 --> 00:29:47,968
Excuse me?

726
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,403
I know about Indira Patel!

727
00:29:51,006 --> 00:29:53,340
I know you replaced me.

728
00:29:55,144 --> 00:29:58,979
Kitty, I think
we could use some tea.

729
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:04,318
Just tell me.

730
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,253
Tell me what math I got wrong.

731
00:30:06,255 --> 00:30:09,356
Tell me why you didn't let me
make it up to you.

732
00:30:09,358 --> 00:30:12,926
It wasn't the maths, it was you.

733
00:30:14,763 --> 00:30:18,232
Your work was impeccable.

734
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:20,334
And for the most part,
I enjoyed our collaborations.

735
00:30:20,336 --> 00:30:24,838
B-But over time, you just...
you became quite... needy.

736
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,406
What are you talking about?

737
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:29,109
Y-You asked my advice
on-on social matters,

738
00:30:29,111 --> 00:30:32,512
and you even invited me
to a party.

739
00:30:32,514 --> 00:30:34,648
You were my friend.

740
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,416
I was your employer, Harlan.

741
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:37,918
A-And you were my consultant.

742
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,419
One of many.

743
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:43,757
I know that I'm a little
obsessed with what I do.

744
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:46,960
That has always made it hard
to make friends.

745
00:30:46,962 --> 00:30:50,664
And I used to feel pretty bad
about that, and then I met you.

746
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:52,566
And I thought to myself,

747
00:30:52,568 --> 00:30:55,903
hey, if it doesn't bother him,
why should I let it bother me?

748
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:03,810
I got a lot
out of the work that we did.

749
00:31:03,812 --> 00:31:06,146
A lot.

750
00:31:06,148 --> 00:31:11,218
But if someone like you thinks
that I'm a loser, then...

751
00:31:22,564 --> 00:31:24,965
Hey, are we still doing this?

752
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:26,366
Doing what?

753
00:31:26,368 --> 00:31:28,502
Talking about the case.

754
00:31:28,504 --> 00:31:30,070
You're just sitting there.

755
00:31:30,072 --> 00:31:32,105
I'm thinking.

756
00:31:32,107 --> 00:31:34,308
I suspect the silence
is exacerbated

757
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,143
by the nature
of our communication.

758
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:37,811
Yes. Well, I don't
live there anymore.

759
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,713
So, if you want
to talk shop at night,

760
00:31:39,715 --> 00:31:41,515
this is the best I can do.

761
00:31:41,517 --> 00:31:45,252
Keep asking myself:
what did the killer want?

762
00:31:45,254 --> 00:31:48,255
He went to great lengths to lure
brilliant mathematicians

763
00:31:48,257 --> 00:31:49,489
to their deaths.

764
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,525
Winnowed out
the less gifted

765
00:31:51,527 --> 00:31:54,061
by making his problems
more and more complicated.

766
00:31:54,063 --> 00:31:57,597
He had a type, but I still think
he's a serial killer

767
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:59,266
only in the most
technical sense.

768
00:31:59,268 --> 00:32:01,201
He tortured both his victims.

769
00:32:01,203 --> 00:32:02,936
But there's no sign
that he enjoyed it.

770
00:32:02,938 --> 00:32:04,538
The work was
utilitarian,

771
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,740
suggesting it was
less for pleasure

772
00:32:06,742 --> 00:32:10,043
and more for persuasion.

773
00:32:10,045 --> 00:32:11,945
He wanted something.

774
00:32:11,947 --> 00:32:13,714
But what?

775
00:32:13,716 --> 00:32:16,483
Maybe there's a connection
between Wallaczek and Lowenthal

776
00:32:16,485 --> 00:32:18,418
we haven't spotted yet.

777
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,220
Maybe they were working
on a project together,

778
00:32:20,222 --> 00:32:21,822
something that was worth
a lot of money.

779
00:32:21,824 --> 00:32:23,857
There's no way the killer
could have predicted

780
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:26,093
which competitors would make it
to the terminal stage.

781
00:32:26,095 --> 00:32:28,795
That part of the game
was beyond his control.

782
00:32:28,797 --> 00:32:30,664
If it weren't,
he would've been prepared

783
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:33,300
to dispose of a body
the size of Ike Wallaczek's.

784
00:32:33,302 --> 00:32:35,335
So, even if there were a
connection between the victims,

785
00:32:35,337 --> 00:32:37,070
the killer could not
have counted on them

786
00:32:37,072 --> 00:32:38,839
being lured into his trap.

787
00:32:38,841 --> 00:32:41,041
Certainly not
in sequence.

788
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:45,112
His game was, in many respects,
one of chance.

789
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:51,718
Suggesting he knows what
he wants, but not who has it.

790
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,888
Like he was on a puzzle hunt
of his own.

791
00:32:56,825 --> 00:32:58,859
I'm back.

792
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:05,665
I'll set up
downstairs, yeah?

793
00:33:09,138 --> 00:33:11,238
I've been thinking about
what you said earlier.

794
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,740
I've decided to engage her
one more time

795
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:15,609
with regards
to her recuperation.

796
00:33:17,112 --> 00:33:21,815
I doubt she'll listen,
but I'll keep you apprised.

797
00:33:25,954 --> 00:33:27,421
I've been thinking.

798
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:29,623
About?
You. Your history.

799
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:31,825
Your decision
not to seek help.

800
00:33:31,827 --> 00:33:34,594
I think it's
a mistake.

801
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,530
Oh?

802
00:33:36,532 --> 00:33:38,198
I've looked into a number
of support groups.

803
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,633
As you are well aware,

804
00:33:39,635 --> 00:33:41,701
I have benefited greatly
from similar settings.

805
00:33:41,703 --> 00:33:43,270
You have.

806
00:33:43,272 --> 00:33:44,638
The process, I find,

807
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,906
is not unlike
voiding one's bowels...

808
00:33:45,908 --> 00:33:47,808
I'll go.
What?

809
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:49,676
I'll go.
Just get me the details.

810
00:33:52,014 --> 00:33:55,182
I've been thinking, too-- about
your number-cruncher, Harlan.

811
00:33:55,184 --> 00:33:57,017
You think I was
too hard on him.

812
00:33:57,019 --> 00:33:58,685
You will have consultants
of your own one day.

813
00:33:58,687 --> 00:34:01,488
You'll see that they require
management and focus.

814
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:04,124
They are but keys on a keyboard,
and we're the typists.

815
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:06,159
You could've given him
a shoeing for all I care.

816
00:34:06,161 --> 00:34:07,828
No, I'm just saying that

817
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:10,030
some of the stuff he's got
up to, it's quite good.

818
00:34:10,032 --> 00:34:11,698
You should take a look.

819
00:34:13,368 --> 00:34:15,735
You may find a fellow typist.

820
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,076
Hello?

821
00:34:23,078 --> 00:34:25,312
Yeah, I
hear that you and some friends

822
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:27,848
are trying to identify
Mo Shellshocker.

823
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,649
That's right. Who is this?

824
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:32,719
His name is Harlan Emple.

825
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:34,020
You got a pen?

826
00:34:34,022 --> 00:34:36,456
I'll-I'll give you his address.

827
00:34:52,454 --> 00:34:54,020
Harlan.

828
00:34:54,022 --> 00:34:56,356
You can't take a hint, can you?

829
00:34:56,358 --> 00:34:57,657
I got your text messages.

830
00:34:57,659 --> 00:34:58,958
I don't want to see you
right now.

831
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,827
So if you came here
to apologize...

832
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:03,363
Actually, I came here
to spare you an agonizing death.

833
00:35:04,299 --> 00:35:05,832
Can I come in?

834
00:35:05,834 --> 00:35:08,301
I was puzzling earlier

835
00:35:08,303 --> 00:35:12,038
as to why the killer went
to such specific lengths.

836
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,606
What did he want?

837
00:35:13,608 --> 00:35:15,809
And then Watson,
quite by accident,

838
00:35:15,811 --> 00:35:17,410
she made a most
compelling analogy.

839
00:35:17,412 --> 00:35:20,080
She said it was as if he
was on a hunt of his own.

840
00:35:20,082 --> 00:35:22,615
Duh. He was hunting
mathematicians.

841
00:35:22,617 --> 00:35:23,783
No, he wasn't.

842
00:35:23,785 --> 00:35:25,151
He was hunting<i> a</i> mathematician.

843
00:35:25,153 --> 00:35:26,619
One.

844
00:35:26,621 --> 00:35:29,389
A man who had concealed
his identity not only

845
00:35:29,391 --> 00:35:31,191
from the mathematics
community at large,

846
00:35:31,193 --> 00:35:32,859
but also from the FBI.

847
00:35:32,861 --> 00:35:35,395
A “crusader,”
you might call him.

848
00:35:35,397 --> 00:35:36,763
Wait a minute.

849
00:35:36,765 --> 00:35:38,731
Are you saying that
this was all about me?

850
00:35:53,448 --> 00:35:56,449
<i> Unfortunately, emulating</i>
<i>the work of people like me</i>

851
00:35:56,451 --> 00:35:59,018
<i>is not without risks.</i>

852
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,320
Creates enemies.

853
00:36:00,322 --> 00:36:02,889
I knew it was the government.

854
00:36:02,891 --> 00:36:04,424
It was a lottery winner.

855
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,260
Little over a year ago,

856
00:36:07,262 --> 00:36:09,529
you started a series of blogs
where you exposed the flaws

857
00:36:09,531 --> 00:36:11,664
in certain scratch card
lottery games.

858
00:36:11,666 --> 00:36:13,766
Tickets like this one.

859
00:36:13,768 --> 00:36:15,802
I wrote about
baited hook games.

860
00:36:15,804 --> 00:36:17,971
Games where the numbers
are printed on the front.

861
00:36:17,973 --> 00:36:20,707
Scratch off the hidden numbers,
hope for a match.

862
00:36:20,709 --> 00:36:23,309
Only, you proved that with
careful mathematical analysis

863
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:25,512
of the visible numbers,
you could predict

864
00:36:25,514 --> 00:36:28,381
which tickets were winners
80% of the time.

865
00:36:28,383 --> 00:36:29,682
If you had exploited

866
00:36:29,684 --> 00:36:32,085
this flaw,
rather than exposing it,

867
00:36:32,087 --> 00:36:33,520
you could have made millions.

868
00:36:33,522 --> 00:36:36,022
Well... sure.
But that would been cheating.

869
00:36:36,024 --> 00:36:37,157
Right.

870
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:38,825
So imagine
for a moment

871
00:36:38,827 --> 00:36:41,060
that you are a less
honest mathematician.

872
00:36:41,062 --> 00:36:42,495
Right?

873
00:36:42,497 --> 00:36:44,063
You've been taking
advantage of these games

874
00:36:44,065 --> 00:36:47,967
for a couple of years to
amass a small fortune.

875
00:36:47,969 --> 00:36:49,502
And then “Mo"
comes along.

876
00:36:49,504 --> 00:36:51,971
He starts exposing
the broken games.

877
00:36:51,973 --> 00:36:54,340
State lottery commissions
shut them down.

878
00:36:54,342 --> 00:36:56,976
The exploitable
games dry up.

879
00:36:56,978 --> 00:37:00,613
Now, if you were a
psychopathic lottery cheat,

880
00:37:00,615 --> 00:37:02,582
how do you fix that?

881
00:37:02,584 --> 00:37:04,484
You kill Mo.

882
00:37:04,486 --> 00:37:07,253
<i>Unfortunately, Mo is elusive.</i>

883
00:37:07,255 --> 00:37:08,821
<i>Anonymous.</i>

884
00:37:08,823 --> 00:37:11,224
The only thing
he knew about him for sure

885
00:37:11,226 --> 00:37:14,394
was that he could not resist
a puzzle hunt.

886
00:37:14,396 --> 00:37:17,130
Now, if you were smart enough
to identify

887
00:37:17,132 --> 00:37:19,399
and take advantage of
broken lottery games...

888
00:37:19,401 --> 00:37:21,868
Then I'm smart enough
to design a puzzle hunt.

889
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:25,338
This plan was not
without its flaws.

890
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:28,775
Once a competitor
reached the terminal stage,

891
00:37:28,777 --> 00:37:32,745
the killer could not be certain
that he'd trapped Mo, could he?

892
00:37:32,747 --> 00:37:34,480
So he tortured them.

893
00:37:34,482 --> 00:37:37,083
I submit he forced them to
log on to Mo's Web site,

894
00:37:37,085 --> 00:37:39,686
and when they failed...

895
00:37:41,323 --> 00:37:42,755
After two murders,

896
00:37:42,757 --> 00:37:44,290
the game was compromised.

897
00:37:44,292 --> 00:37:46,192
So the killer devises
a Plan “B.”

898
00:37:46,194 --> 00:37:47,460
He tricks

899
00:37:47,462 --> 00:37:49,229
a group of his peers

900
00:37:49,231 --> 00:37:51,097
into helping search
for an alternative means

901
00:37:51,099 --> 00:37:53,032
of identifying Mo.

902
00:37:56,504 --> 00:37:58,438
You're talking about that guy.

903
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,906
The one with the penthouse.

904
00:37:59,908 --> 00:38:02,742
<i>Paul?</i>

905
00:38:02,744 --> 00:38:05,044
Lottery winners
are public record.

906
00:38:05,046 --> 00:38:07,814
So when I searched for
the names of repeat winners

907
00:38:07,816 --> 00:38:09,482
in the dates prior
to your posts...

908
00:38:09,484 --> 00:38:11,317
I can't believe
I drank his water.

909
00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:12,685
I called him.

910
00:38:12,687 --> 00:38:14,654
I identified you as Mo.

911
00:38:14,656 --> 00:38:16,122
And I gave him your address.

912
00:38:16,124 --> 00:38:17,590
You what?!

913
00:38:21,129 --> 00:38:23,062
Drop your weapon!

914
00:38:23,064 --> 00:38:24,597
<i>I did not, however, give him</i>

915
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:25,965
<i>the correct apartment number.</i>

916
00:38:25,967 --> 00:38:28,334
He was arrested
a little over an hour ago.

917
00:38:30,739 --> 00:38:31,871
Tried to call you to
tell you, but, um...

918
00:38:31,873 --> 00:38:33,539
But I was ignoring you.

919
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:35,008
Yes, you were ignoring me.

920
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,209
Look, you know

921
00:38:36,211 --> 00:38:37,377
that I'm still screwed, right?

922
00:38:37,379 --> 00:38:39,279
You told him that I'm Mo.

923
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:42,115
He's gonna tell the police,
they're gonna tell the FBI...

924
00:38:42,117 --> 00:38:43,516
The NYPD is under
the impression

925
00:38:43,518 --> 00:38:45,385
that I lied about
your connection to Mo

926
00:38:45,387 --> 00:38:47,920
in order to draw
Mr. Ettinger out.

927
00:38:47,922 --> 00:38:49,555
As far as the
FBI goes, well,

928
00:38:49,557 --> 00:38:51,958
I've got some associates
who have created a trail

929
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,860
which will
strongly suggest that Mo

930
00:38:53,862 --> 00:38:55,728
is a cyber-terrorist
I became aware of

931
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:58,197
whilst working for, um...

932
00:38:58,199 --> 00:38:59,766
queen and country.

933
00:38:59,768 --> 00:39:02,135
Your secret's
quite safe.

934
00:39:02,137 --> 00:39:03,903
Thanks.

935
00:39:06,508 --> 00:39:09,776
My reasons for preserving you
are entirely selfish, Harlan.

936
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:13,279
You are a tremendous asset.

937
00:39:13,281 --> 00:39:15,815
I have little doubt

938
00:39:15,817 --> 00:39:19,118
I will need your help again
in the future.

939
00:39:26,461 --> 00:39:28,528
Me or him?

940
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:29,996
You.

941
00:39:29,998 --> 00:39:31,798
I have an update on
that real estate flipper.

942
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,433
I thought you might
want to know.

943
00:39:39,274 --> 00:39:41,908
I tracked down the truck rental
receipts to get her name.

944
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,142
Valerie Cork.

945
00:39:43,144 --> 00:39:44,911
She's an art authenticator.

946
00:39:44,913 --> 00:39:46,779
And that crate you saw?

947
00:39:46,781 --> 00:39:48,414
There was
something called

948
00:39:48,416 --> 00:39:50,683
a scanning fluorescence
spectrometry machine inside.

949
00:39:50,685 --> 00:39:52,251
They're used...
To find paintings

950
00:39:52,253 --> 00:39:53,553
underneath other paintings.

951
00:39:53,555 --> 00:39:55,288
So it turns out
that the building

952
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:56,689
Chad Keswick was looking to buy

953
00:39:56,691 --> 00:39:59,025
was leased by the WPA
during the Depression.

954
00:39:59,027 --> 00:40:00,927
They commissioned a
mural for the lobby.

955
00:40:00,929 --> 00:40:03,329
The artist was a
notorious communist,

956
00:40:03,331 --> 00:40:05,365
so when the property passed
into private hands in the '50s,

957
00:40:05,367 --> 00:40:06,999
the new owners
had it painted over.

958
00:40:07,001 --> 00:40:08,735
But it was still there,
under the paint.

959
00:40:08,737 --> 00:40:11,037
A lost work by Diego Rivera.

960
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:13,473
It's worth ten times
the price of the building.

961
00:40:14,676 --> 00:40:17,043
I was hoping to leak
the truth to the<i> Times.</i>

962
00:40:18,113 --> 00:40:20,046
I promised you a cut of my fee.

963
00:40:20,048 --> 00:40:22,148
But I'm pretty sure
the mural's gonna end up

964
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:24,384
in the hands of
a historical trust.

965
00:40:24,386 --> 00:40:26,352
I'd feel obligated
to refund my client,

966
00:40:26,354 --> 00:40:28,388
which means you'd get
a cut of nothing.

967
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:31,457
That works for me.

968
00:40:31,459 --> 00:40:33,493
Okay.

969
00:40:35,463 --> 00:40:37,397
I think you should know

970
00:40:37,399 --> 00:40:39,732
that I am going
to a meeting tonight.

971
00:40:41,803 --> 00:40:45,505
One of those
support groups for...

972
00:40:45,507 --> 00:40:47,340
people like me.

973
00:40:47,342 --> 00:40:49,876
It was, uh, Sherlock's idea.

974
00:40:49,878 --> 00:40:51,644
That's great.

975
00:40:51,646 --> 00:40:53,446
I know you put him up to it.

976
00:40:53,448 --> 00:40:55,381
We talked.

977
00:40:57,552 --> 00:41:00,219
When he first approached me
in London,

978
00:41:00,221 --> 00:41:03,556
I was...

979
00:41:03,558 --> 00:41:05,558
in a bad way.

980
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,227
And I had been for a while.

981
00:41:08,229 --> 00:41:11,130
But then,
when he talked about

982
00:41:11,132 --> 00:41:12,365
the work that he did,

983
00:41:12,367 --> 00:41:16,035
about the things
that he saw in me...

984
00:41:18,406 --> 00:41:19,739
I want it.

985
00:41:19,741 --> 00:41:21,874
I want every bit
of what's he offered me,

986
00:41:21,876 --> 00:41:23,843
of what he offered you, but...

987
00:41:23,845 --> 00:41:26,212
if I've learned one thing
over the last few weeks,

988
00:41:26,214 --> 00:41:28,047
it's that he can't pull it off.

989
00:41:28,049 --> 00:41:29,682
Not by himself, anyway.

990
00:41:31,586 --> 00:41:34,153
And if I'm gonna get
what I want,

991
00:41:34,155 --> 00:41:37,690
then I'm going to need
your help, too.

992
00:41:40,361 --> 00:41:42,829
I still think
the meetings are bollocks,

993
00:41:42,831 --> 00:41:44,931
but you say they're important.

994
00:41:44,933 --> 00:41:47,967
They matter to you, so...

995
00:41:47,969 --> 00:41:49,735
What do you say, Watson?

996
00:41:49,737 --> 00:41:52,071
Will you help me?

997
00:41:56,277 --> 00:41:58,244
I don't know how it happened.

998
00:41:58,246 --> 00:42:01,547
It just... hit me.

999
00:42:01,549 --> 00:42:03,983
Like a truck, out of nowhere.

1000
00:42:04,853 --> 00:42:07,753
Work is good.

1001
00:42:07,755 --> 00:42:09,755
I have friends.

1002
00:42:09,757 --> 00:42:13,092
I'm in a
relationship.

1003
00:42:13,094 --> 00:42:16,896
Somewhere along
the way, somehow,

1004
00:42:16,898 --> 00:42:19,732
I stopped being a victim

1005
00:42:19,734 --> 00:42:22,602
and became a survivor.

1006
00:42:22,604 --> 00:42:25,705
So, I guess all I'm saying is,
there's hope.

1007
00:42:26,357 --> 00:42:31,686
Do the work. Love yourself.
There's hope.

If you're looking for Sherlock,
he's downstairs.

3
00:00:04,785 --> 00:00:05,841
Okay.

4
00:00:05,842 --> 00:00:07,541
<i>His name is Harlan Emple.</i>

00:00:07,543 --> 00:00:09,176
<i>He is the Rachel P. Hanson</i>
<i>Professor</i>

6
00:00:09,178 --> 00:00:11,301
for Applied Mathematics
at Columbia University.

7
00:00:11,301 --> 00:00:14,502
What I don't get is
why he isn't wearing a shirt.

8
00:00:14,504 --> 00:00:17,372
He doesn't like anything to come
between him and the numbers.

9
00:00:17,374 --> 00:00:18,415
What is it?

10
00:00:18,438 --> 00:00:20,274
The answers to your questions
about Kitty.

11
00:00:20,276 --> 00:00:22,710
The truth is she was a
victim of a horrific crime.

12
00:00:22,712 --> 00:00:24,646
<i>After you left last night,</i>

13
00:00:24,648 --> 00:00:26,848
Sherlock gave me an envelope.

14
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,249
Sherlock keeps saying

15
00:00:28,251 --> 00:00:30,385
that I need to get
a better sense of you,

16
00:00:30,387 --> 00:00:33,021
and maybe that will give you
a better sense of me.

17
00:00:42,065 --> 00:00:43,065
It's open.

18
00:00:47,637 --> 00:00:49,003
It's nothing.

19
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:50,872
It's Sherlock and
one of his experts.

20
00:00:50,874 --> 00:00:52,006
Which one?

21
00:00:52,008 --> 00:00:53,241
Phillip something.

22
00:00:53,243 --> 00:00:54,575
Must be new.

23
00:00:54,577 --> 00:00:57,445
He's a knife-thrower.

24
00:00:57,447 --> 00:00:58,913
Why does Sherlock have
a knife-thrower?

25
00:00:58,915 --> 00:01:00,748
He got bored the other day,

26
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,185
started looking into this, uh,
circus accident from the '30s.

27
00:01:04,187 --> 00:01:07,922
The Great Galardo perforated one
of his assistants during an act,

28
00:01:07,924 --> 00:01:09,924
except Sherlock thinks
the blade was thrown

29
00:01:09,926 --> 00:01:11,492
by somebody in the stands,
not Galardo.

30
00:01:11,494 --> 00:01:15,096
Phillip, as far as I
can tell, disagrees.

31
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:18,900
It can't be done, okay?

32
00:01:18,902 --> 00:01:19,934
It was done.

33
00:01:19,936 --> 00:01:21,335
You're wrong.

34
00:01:21,337 --> 00:01:23,538
Nobody can chuck
a knife that far.

35
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,239
What's this?

36
00:01:25,241 --> 00:01:26,207
You're...

37
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:27,209
Not here.

38
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,509
I'm not here.

39
00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:29,711
Remember that, okay?

40
00:01:29,713 --> 00:01:31,279
Oh, yes. Heaven
forfend your work

41
00:01:31,281 --> 00:01:33,247
with me should endanger
your precious day job.

42
00:01:33,249 --> 00:01:35,116
You throw knives?

43
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,252
You know, it was supposed
to be just you here.

44
00:01:38,254 --> 00:01:41,355
Phillip is arguably the greatest
knife-thrower in the world.

45
00:01:41,357 --> 00:01:42,790
Has been for decades.

46
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:43,925
Only, there's little money

47
00:01:43,927 --> 00:01:45,193
to be made
in the impalement arts.

48
00:01:45,195 --> 00:01:46,494
So, as a youth, he turned

49
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,563
to what you Americans
term “football”"

50
00:01:48,565 --> 00:01:50,131
Is this a joke?

51
00:01:53,837 --> 00:01:55,002
Phillip, head
and heart.

52
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:56,904
Come on.
Head and heart.

53
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:06,814
Can I go?

54
00:02:06,816 --> 00:02:09,484
Yeah.

55
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,489
15 years he spent throwing
that misshapen ball around.

56
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:16,057
15 years.

57
00:02:16,059 --> 00:02:18,259
When I think of the acclaim
he could have brought

58
00:02:18,261 --> 00:02:20,828
to competitive blade slinging.

59
00:02:27,237 --> 00:02:29,036
You're following me,
Watson.

60
00:02:29,038 --> 00:02:30,338
I don't like it.

61
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,740
I want you to help
me with something.

62
00:02:32,742 --> 00:02:33,908
This is Chad Keswick.

63
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,976
He buys distressed
buildings,

64
00:02:34,978 --> 00:02:36,210
paints, spackles,

65
00:02:36,212 --> 00:02:37,645
and then flips them
for quick money.

66
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:39,180
Who'd he kill?
No one.

67
00:02:39,182 --> 00:02:41,315
I was hired by one of
his rivals to find out

68
00:02:41,317 --> 00:02:43,017
why he's been circling
this old office building

69
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:44,218
in Jamaica, Queens.

70
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,586
She wants to know
why he thinks

71
00:02:45,588 --> 00:02:47,355
the building is
a good investment.

72
00:02:47,357 --> 00:02:49,590
Is there a crime in there,
something worth investigating?

73
00:02:49,592 --> 00:02:50,925
Well, I've been
shadowing Keswick,

74
00:02:50,927 --> 00:02:52,593
but yesterday I think
he noticed me.

75
00:02:52,595 --> 00:02:54,595
I want to switch
up the tail.

76
00:02:54,597 --> 00:02:57,231
You followed me for over
a week before I noticed you.

77
00:02:57,233 --> 00:02:59,033
Help me out, and I'll
cut you in on my fee.

78
00:02:59,035 --> 00:03:02,003
I don't work for you,
I work for Sherlock.

79
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:03,437
I worked for him, too.

80
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,773
And, in my experience,
he was always supportive

81
00:03:05,775 --> 00:03:07,942
of taking on work
outside the partnership.

82
00:03:07,944 --> 00:03:10,912
Sorry, it's not my cup of tea.

83
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:33,034

Math-- maybe you've heard of it.

96

One dead guy

found in the same

I was not “found” there;
I am the one who called 911.

99
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,310
I was waiting there
for the police.

100
00:05:08,312 --> 00:05:09,745
Mr. Emple,

101
00:05:09,747 --> 00:05:11,613
we're just trying
to do our jobs, all right?

102
00:05:11,615 --> 00:05:13,048
First officers
on the scene described you

103
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,516
as “extremely agitated.”

104
00:05:14,518 --> 00:05:15,984
Well, of course
I was agitated.

105
00:05:15,986 --> 00:05:18,754
I had just found
a dead guy in mothballs!

106
00:05:18,756 --> 00:05:21,790
And did I mention that I have
not slept in almost two days?

107
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:23,358
Because of the math game.

108
00:05:24,762 --> 00:05:26,195
Can I borrow those?

109
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:31,100
This...

110
00:05:31,102 --> 00:05:33,302
is Belphegor's Prime, okay?

111
00:05:33,304 --> 00:05:35,304
It's a numeric palindrome.

112
00:05:35,306 --> 00:05:40,776
It's 666 bookended by 13 zeroes
and then bracketed with ones.

113
00:05:40,778 --> 00:05:43,846
Named for the demon Belphegor
who was a prince of hell.

114
00:05:43,848 --> 00:05:46,448
The first clue for the hunt
started making the rounds

115
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,883
a few months ago.

116
00:05:47,885 --> 00:05:49,651
It was a JPEG with two numbers
hidden in it.

117
00:05:49,653 --> 00:05:51,453
You divide those numbers
by Belphegor's Prime,

118
00:05:51,455 --> 00:05:54,890
and you get the GPS coordinates
for a restroom at the Bronx Zoo.

119
00:05:54,892 --> 00:05:56,959
You go to the restroom,
you find a phone number.

120
00:05:56,961 --> 00:05:58,927
You send a text to the number,
you get the next clue.

121
00:05:58,929 --> 00:05:59,962
Which is another math problem.

122
00:05:59,964 --> 00:06:00,929
Exactly.

123
00:06:00,931 --> 00:06:02,397
Only, this one is harder.

124
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,099
And that's how it works.

125
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:05,934
You know, but for
each one that you solve,

126
00:06:05,936 --> 00:06:08,103
you get a new set
of GPS coordinates.

127
00:06:08,105 --> 00:06:11,473
And that means that you've
completed a stage, or a portal.

128
00:06:11,475 --> 00:06:13,509
And last night,
I was on Portal Ten.

129
00:06:13,511 --> 00:06:15,711
And...

130
00:06:17,014 --> 00:06:18,313
You know what?

131
00:06:18,315 --> 00:06:20,015
I want to talk
to Sherlock and Joan.

132
00:06:20,017 --> 00:06:21,917
Look, Mr. Emple...
No, I'm sorry.

133
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,019
I told the police down
at the factory that I know them.

134
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:25,287
Isn't that the whole reason

135
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:26,922
that I was brought here
to this squad?

136
00:06:26,924 --> 00:06:30,392
I-I am not saying another word
until they are here.

137
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:35,264
Harlan Emple is
indeed an acquaintance.

138
00:06:35,266 --> 00:06:37,733
He is, in point of fact,
one of my “irregulars.”

139
00:06:37,735 --> 00:06:38,801
One of your what?

140
00:06:38,803 --> 00:06:40,302
Irregulars.

141
00:06:40,304 --> 00:06:41,770
I'm your consultant, Captain;
they are mine.

142
00:06:41,772 --> 00:06:43,572
They're a handful
of experts I turn to

143
00:06:43,574 --> 00:06:46,108
when I encounter problems which
are beyond my pool of knowledge.

144
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,810
Harlan is
a brilliant mathematician.

145
00:06:47,812 --> 00:06:49,778
And on the handful of occasions
I have tackled a case

146
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,046
which pertained
to mathematics...

147
00:06:51,048 --> 00:06:53,182
He helped you out.
Well, the good news

148
00:06:53,184 --> 00:06:56,018
for him is the preliminary
autopsy report just came in

149
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,252
before you got here.

150
00:06:57,254 --> 00:06:59,021
And the M.E. puts
the time of death

151
00:06:59,023 --> 00:07:00,989
between 4:00 and
6:00 p.m. last night.

152
00:07:00,991 --> 00:07:02,124
Mr. Emple was teaching

153
00:07:02,126 --> 00:07:03,358
a class at Columbia.

154
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,394
So the victim is
yet to be identified?

155
00:07:05,396 --> 00:07:07,663
No I.D., no phone.

156
00:07:07,665 --> 00:07:09,865
First detective on the scene
liked it for a mob hit,

157
00:07:09,867 --> 00:07:11,500
so while we're
running the prints,

158
00:07:11,502 --> 00:07:13,602
he's showing the vic's
face around OCID.

159
00:07:13,604 --> 00:07:16,839
Marcus here was about to walk
the scene with Mr. Emple.

160
00:07:16,841 --> 00:07:18,774
You're here now;
you might as well tag along.

161
00:07:18,776 --> 00:07:21,009
Actually, Captain,
I'm quite busy today.

162
00:07:21,011 --> 00:07:22,978
This is a John Doe,
and we got nothing.

163
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,247
And, like you just said,
you're my consultant.

164
00:07:25,249 --> 00:07:26,748
So, go consult.

165
00:07:29,787 --> 00:07:30,986
Watson.

166
00:07:30,988 --> 00:07:32,588
Um, he's your friend.

167
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,523
Actually, Kitty is
otherwise engaged,

168
00:07:34,525 --> 00:07:37,426
and he did actually help both
of us with a case last year.

169
00:07:37,428 --> 00:07:38,493
Did he not?

170
00:07:40,865 --> 00:07:44,099
Have I told you
how good it is to see you?

171
00:07:44,101 --> 00:07:45,367
Yes, you have.
Three times.

172
00:07:45,369 --> 00:07:46,468
Well, it is.

173
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,636
Hey, lousy circumstances.

174
00:07:47,638 --> 00:07:49,371
But, uh, hey...

175
00:07:49,373 --> 00:07:51,740
I heard from your boss that you
just, uh, got back from London.

176
00:07:51,742 --> 00:07:53,308
Were you working
a case or...?

177
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,576
No, I moved back there.

178
00:07:54,578 --> 00:07:55,677
You mean<i> moved,</i> moved?

179
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:56,845
Is there another
definition?

180
00:07:56,847 --> 00:07:58,513
I was there for
eight months,

181
00:07:58,515 --> 00:08:00,883
and had a change of heart
and returned to New York.

182
00:08:00,885 --> 00:08:02,517
So, you moved to London,
and you didn't, uh...

183
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,086
You know what?
Doesn't even matter.

184
00:08:04,088 --> 00:08:05,387
The point is you're back!

185
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:07,389
Mr. Emple.
Uh, duty calls.

186
00:08:07,391 --> 00:08:09,024
Yeah.

187
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:18,634
It's interesting.

188
00:08:18,636 --> 00:08:20,068
Mothballs are interesting?

189
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,070
They were taken from
that cabinet over there.

190
00:08:22,072 --> 00:08:25,941
Obviously, to cover the smell
of John Doe's decay.

191
00:08:25,943 --> 00:08:28,043
The killer didn't
bring them with him.

192
00:08:28,045 --> 00:08:31,179
Perhaps leaving the body here
was not part of his plan, hmm?

193
00:08:32,983 --> 00:08:36,018
Doe was shot in the foot
first and then the knee.

194
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,453
Either those were
two really bad misses or...

195
00:08:38,455 --> 00:08:41,256
Or the killer was torturing him.

196
00:08:41,258 --> 00:08:43,892
This doesn't seem like anything
you can't handle on your own.

197
00:08:43,894 --> 00:08:45,994
So you want to tell me why you
really asked me to come here?

198
00:08:45,996 --> 00:08:48,363
“This doesn't seem like anything
you can't handle on your own.”

199
00:08:48,365 --> 00:08:49,765
That's funny.

200
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:51,566
That's exactly what
I would have said

201
00:08:51,568 --> 00:08:53,602
had I been present when you
asked Kitty for her assistance

202
00:08:53,604 --> 00:08:54,937
with your tawdry side job.

203
00:08:54,939 --> 00:08:57,372
“Tawdry”?
I wanted you to know I approve.

204
00:08:57,374 --> 00:08:59,007
Of what?

205
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:01,376
Your agenda
with regards to Kitty.

206
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:03,078
Several days ago,
I gave you her file.

207
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,913
And then you show up at
the brownstone yesterday,

208
00:09:04,915 --> 00:09:06,515
and you invite her
into an investigation.

209
00:09:06,517 --> 00:09:08,183
Coincidence? No, I think not.

210
00:09:08,185 --> 00:09:11,320
You feel for her.
And now you wish to engage.

211
00:09:11,322 --> 00:09:13,956
It's not an outcome
I would have predicted, no.

212
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,458
But it is one
I approve of, yeah.

213
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,193
She could learn
a great deal from you,

214
00:09:18,195 --> 00:09:20,228
especially with regards
to how to get the most

215
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,864
from my tutelage.

216
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:25,734
So, I've already dispatched her
to, uh, follow your Mr. Keswick.

217
00:09:25,736 --> 00:09:27,836
But that's not
what I actually...

218
00:09:27,838 --> 00:09:29,404
Harlan!

219
00:09:30,741 --> 00:09:33,075
You came here to retrieve
a phone number, did you not?

220
00:09:33,077 --> 00:09:34,609
You would send a text,
and then receive

221
00:09:34,611 --> 00:09:36,845
the next clue in the game
that you were playing.

222
00:09:36,847 --> 00:09:38,747
Yeah, but I didn't find it.

223
00:09:38,749 --> 00:09:40,048
Not that I kept looking

224
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,250
after the dead guy
fell out of the locker.

225
00:09:42,252 --> 00:09:44,052
Yeah, CSU didn't find
any number either.

226
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:46,154
Probably because
it's under that paint.

227
00:09:46,156 --> 00:09:48,190
It's fresh.

228
00:09:48,192 --> 00:09:49,891
Applied in the last

229
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:52,694
24 hours.

230
00:09:52,696 --> 00:09:54,696
Right after John Doe's murder,
I'd wager.

231
00:09:54,698 --> 00:09:57,099
You don't think
this was a mob hit?

232
00:09:57,101 --> 00:09:59,101
Doe and the killer were
playing the game, too.

233
00:09:59,103 --> 00:10:01,203
The killer shot Doe and
then covered up the number

234
00:10:01,205 --> 00:10:02,704
so no one else could use it.

235
00:10:02,706 --> 00:10:04,806
What's the prize
in your little contest?

236
00:10:04,808 --> 00:10:07,576
Well, I'm doing it
mostly for the math.

237
00:10:07,578 --> 00:10:11,480
But, uh, $1,707,071.

238
00:10:11,482 --> 00:10:13,882
It's another
palindromic prime.

239
00:10:13,884 --> 00:10:17,152
Did I not mention the
money at the station?

240
00:10:17,154 --> 00:10:18,587
Who the hell can afford

241
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:20,655
that kind of payout
for a puzzle hunt?

242
00:10:20,657 --> 00:10:22,124
Well, most people
think it's CAML.

243
00:10:22,126 --> 00:10:24,593
The Center for Applied
Mathematics and Logic.

244
00:10:24,595 --> 00:10:26,094
It's located
in Ramapo...

245
00:10:26,096 --> 00:10:27,729
Wait, most people
“think” it's them?

246
00:10:27,731 --> 00:10:29,331
Well, hunts like these,

247
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,266
the organizers are
almost always anonymous.

248
00:10:31,268 --> 00:10:32,401
It's S.O.P.

249
00:10:32,403 --> 00:10:34,302
What about the
contestants?

250
00:10:34,304 --> 00:10:37,005
Is anonymity
also S.O.P.?

251
00:10:37,007 --> 00:10:39,207
For the most part, yeah.

252
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:43,078
But, guys, math peeps
are my peeps, okay?

253
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,314
It's, uh, like
a community, sort of.

254
00:10:46,316 --> 00:10:48,984
I can think of ten
or 12 other people

255
00:10:48,986 --> 00:10:50,018
who were probably competing.

256
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,186
Would that help?

257
00:10:53,157 --> 00:10:55,223
No.

258
00:10:55,225 --> 00:10:58,026
I'm sorry, I don't know him.

259
00:10:58,028 --> 00:11:00,862
But you admit you were
competing in Belphegor's Prime.

260
00:11:00,864 --> 00:11:02,197
I do.

261
00:11:04,835 --> 00:11:05,934
Pepe!

262
00:11:08,172 --> 00:11:10,439
Sorry. He doesn't
like strangers.

263
00:11:12,109 --> 00:11:14,443
Give him one of these.

264
00:11:14,445 --> 00:11:16,111
Get on his good side.

265
00:11:24,288 --> 00:11:26,354
What are you doing?

266
00:11:28,225 --> 00:11:30,725
I'm just verifying that
you've been lying to us.

267
00:11:30,727 --> 00:11:33,895
You did know the
dead man, did you not?

268
00:11:33,897 --> 00:11:36,998
I reviewed his personal
effects at the morgue earlier.

269
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,034
The coroner reported finding
crumbs in one of his pockets.

270
00:11:39,036 --> 00:11:40,036
I tasted one.

271
00:11:40,037 --> 00:11:41,269
Why would you...?

272
00:11:41,271 --> 00:11:42,771
At first, I thought
they were from

273
00:11:42,773 --> 00:11:44,439
a particularly rancid
brand of cheese,

274
00:11:44,441 --> 00:11:47,609
but, no... they're from
one of Pepe's treats.

275
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:49,277
Homemade?

276
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,481
Harlan was able to give us
the names of nine other people

277
00:11:52,483 --> 00:11:54,149
he believed to be
other competitors.

278
00:11:54,151 --> 00:11:55,984
Our colleagues are
investigating them as we speak,

279
00:11:55,986 --> 00:11:57,919
but I'll quite happily
recommend that the NYPD

280
00:11:57,921 --> 00:12:00,222
focus its attention
entirely on you.

281
00:12:04,128 --> 00:12:06,428
His name was Ike Walaczek.

282
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,231
In another lifetime,
he was my boyfriend.

283
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:10,866
And what of
this lifetime?

284
00:12:10,868 --> 00:12:12,701
We were working together.

285
00:12:12,703 --> 00:12:14,769
On Belphegor's.
What?!

286
00:12:14,771 --> 00:12:16,705
He was a numerical analyst
at the Tory Foundation.

287
00:12:16,707 --> 00:12:17,873
I work mostly in combinatorics.

288
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,307
I thought we would make
a good team.

289
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:20,742
But there aren't
supposed to be teams.

290
00:12:20,744 --> 00:12:22,711
Not in a puzzle hunt.
It's bad form.

291
00:12:22,713 --> 00:12:23,713
Harlan...

292
00:12:23,714 --> 00:12:25,514
I'm just saying...

293
00:12:25,516 --> 00:12:27,315
My husband
wouldn't understand,

294
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:30,385
so I decided I wouldn't tell him
until after we won the money.

295
00:12:30,387 --> 00:12:33,121
A team-- so that's how
you got there before me.

296
00:12:33,123 --> 00:12:34,489
I wasn't there.

297
00:12:34,491 --> 00:12:36,258
Tom and I were out of town
until this morning.

298
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,126
His cousin
was getting married in Hawaii.

299
00:12:38,128 --> 00:12:40,662
That's why Ike went
to the coordinates by himself.

300
00:12:40,664 --> 00:12:42,097
Because I couldn't.

301
00:12:44,268 --> 00:12:46,601
These are pictures I took.

302
00:12:46,603 --> 00:12:49,337
Check the dates.

303
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:51,506
You gave the police
nine other names?

304
00:12:51,508 --> 00:12:53,408
People you thought
were competing?

305
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,776
I've got 16.

306
00:12:54,778 --> 00:12:56,311
And I know they were competing.

307
00:12:58,448 --> 00:13:01,249
He talked to her
outside the Jamaica property

308
00:13:01,251 --> 00:13:05,720
for about 20 minutes,
and then this truck rolled up.

309
00:13:05,722 --> 00:13:07,822
Any idea what's
inside the crate?

310
00:13:07,824 --> 00:13:09,024
Nope.

311
00:13:09,026 --> 00:13:10,392
I can't identify
the woman either.

312
00:13:10,394 --> 00:13:12,260
Everything about her
said money though.

313
00:13:12,262 --> 00:13:15,363
She, Keswick
and the mystery box

314
00:13:15,365 --> 00:13:17,732
stayed inside the building
for about three hours,

315
00:13:17,734 --> 00:13:20,001
and then off they went.

316
00:13:20,904 --> 00:13:22,170
Good.

317
00:13:22,172 --> 00:13:23,872
Okay.

318
00:13:23,874 --> 00:13:26,074
You know where
to send the check.

319
00:13:26,076 --> 00:13:30,145
You haven't asked me about
the file Sherlock gave me.

320
00:13:30,147 --> 00:13:32,080
Why would I?

321
00:13:32,082 --> 00:13:36,184
You said it would give me
a better sense of you-- it did.

322
00:13:37,588 --> 00:13:40,155
That's why you asked
for my help.

323
00:13:40,157 --> 00:13:41,990
Because you felt sorry for me.

324
00:13:41,992 --> 00:13:44,226
No.

325
00:13:44,228 --> 00:13:46,194
You just don't seem interested
in anything

326
00:13:46,196 --> 00:13:48,063
outside of becoming
a detective.

327
00:13:48,065 --> 00:13:50,999
There she is.

328
00:13:51,001 --> 00:13:53,301
The old counselor.

329
00:13:53,303 --> 00:13:55,637
Who used to hold
Sherlock's hand.

330
00:13:57,608 --> 00:13:59,741
Everything that you read,

331
00:13:59,743 --> 00:14:02,510
everything that happened to me,
that's all it is.

332
00:14:02,512 --> 00:14:04,646
It's just something
that happened.

333
00:14:04,648 --> 00:14:08,116
And it's all
in the past now.

334
00:14:08,118 --> 00:14:10,685
So let's just
leave it there, shall we?

335
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:24,667
Hello.

336
00:14:24,668 --> 00:14:26,001
You've had sex.

337
00:14:26,003 --> 00:14:27,202
Excuse me?

338
00:14:27,204 --> 00:14:28,503
I can hear it
in your voice.

339
00:14:28,505 --> 00:14:29,771
You've joined paunches.

340
00:14:29,773 --> 00:14:30,972
Good for you, Watson.

341
00:14:30,974 --> 00:14:32,807
As you know, I think
the act of love

342
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:34,676
can be quite conducive to...
What do you want?

343
00:14:34,678 --> 00:14:36,911
Merely to apprise you
of a new development

344
00:14:36,913 --> 00:14:38,280
in the murder of
Ike Walaczek.

345
00:14:38,282 --> 00:14:40,115
As I informed
you yesterday,

346
00:14:40,117 --> 00:14:42,284
Harlan and I were given
a new list of competitors.

347
00:14:42,286 --> 00:14:45,320
One name leapt out:
Byron Lowenthal.

348
00:14:45,322 --> 00:14:48,156
He's a statistician at the
Public Utilities Commission

349
00:14:48,158 --> 00:14:50,425
and a diagnosed
paranoid schizophrenic.

350
00:14:50,427 --> 00:14:52,160
He's been hospitalized
for becoming violent

351
00:14:52,162 --> 00:14:53,728
on no fewer
than three occasions.

352
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,964
Certainly sounds like
it could be our guy.

353
00:14:55,966 --> 00:14:59,367
Unfortunately, Mr. Lowenthal had
another break earlier this year.

354
00:14:59,369 --> 00:15:02,137
He's been staying in
a transient hotel ever since.

355
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:04,239
Detective Bell and I
are going to speak with him.

356
00:15:04,241 --> 00:15:05,307
You want me to meet you?

357
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:06,875
Oh, no, we're already here.

358
00:15:06,877 --> 00:15:08,410
Anyway, now that I know
that you've enjoyed coitus

359
00:15:08,412 --> 00:15:09,778
and could enjoy more
in the near future...

360
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,846
When you're done,
we need to talk.

361
00:15:14,718 --> 00:15:16,818
Byron Lowenthal,
you in there?

362
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,053
Who is it?

363
00:15:18,055 --> 00:15:19,754
It's Detective Bell, NYPD.

364
00:15:19,756 --> 00:15:22,257
My colleague and I would like
to ask you some questions.

365
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:24,592
Let me
get some pants on.

366
00:15:37,341 --> 00:15:40,008
S-Sorry, I just... I, um...

367
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,310
I-I thought I heard
Mr. Lowenthal retr...

368
00:16:19,154 --> 00:16:21,267
You guys got lucky.

369
00:16:21,268 --> 00:16:22,868
Well, luck had little
to do with it, actually.

370
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,536
I... I heard Mr. Lowenthal

371
00:16:24,538 --> 00:16:27,039
pulling a heavy object off
a shelf, placing it on his bed,

372
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,041
and the sound of
the zipper indicated

373
00:16:29,043 --> 00:16:30,976
that it was
a large gun case.

374
00:16:30,978 --> 00:16:33,579
Looks like he was sane enough
to do math, but not much else.

375
00:16:33,581 --> 00:16:34,747
Plus, he was
pretty hopped up.

376
00:16:34,749 --> 00:16:36,448
Caffeine pills,
energy drinks,

377
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,251
pretty much every legal
stimulant you can buy.

378
00:16:39,253 --> 00:16:40,853
Plus a few illegal ones.

379
00:16:40,855 --> 00:16:42,821
Hmm. Obviously, he was
keeping himself awake

380
00:16:42,823 --> 00:16:44,490
so he could work on
Belphegor's.

381
00:16:44,492 --> 00:16:47,392
This... is obvious to you?

382
00:16:47,394 --> 00:16:48,961
I confess the maths
are beyond me,

383
00:16:48,963 --> 00:16:51,130
but I took the liberty of
sending pictures of what

384
00:16:51,132 --> 00:16:52,865
appear to be Mr. Lowenthal's
most recent scribbles

385
00:16:52,867 --> 00:16:54,166
to Harlan Emple,
and he's confirmed

386
00:16:54,168 --> 00:16:55,667
they are part of the contest.

387
00:16:55,669 --> 00:16:56,969
With your permission,
I'd like copies of these

388
00:16:56,971 --> 00:16:58,837
sent to my home
so he can review them.

389
00:16:58,839 --> 00:16:59,972
What for?

390
00:16:59,974 --> 00:17:01,073
If Byron Lowenthal

391
00:17:01,075 --> 00:17:02,441
did kill Ike Walaczek,

392
00:17:02,443 --> 00:17:04,109
then he used
and obscured a phone number,

393
00:17:04,111 --> 00:17:05,878
which would have yielded
the next problem.

394
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,379
That problem's solution

395
00:17:07,381 --> 00:17:08,714
would be GPS coordinates.

396
00:17:08,716 --> 00:17:10,415
If he's recorded them
in his books...

397
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:12,551
Your pal will be able to tell us
where he's headed next.

398
00:17:12,553 --> 00:17:14,853
I'll get our guys to give you

399
00:17:14,855 --> 00:17:16,388
whatever you need.

400
00:17:17,258 --> 00:17:18,991
Scans are still coming through,

401
00:17:18,993 --> 00:17:21,260
but I've put what we've got
so far up on the wall.

402
00:17:21,262 --> 00:17:23,262
Sherlock said that
you prefer it that way.

403
00:17:23,264 --> 00:17:25,030
Picked it up from him,
actually.

404
00:17:25,032 --> 00:17:28,600
Makes me feel like I'm really
inside of the problem.

405
00:17:30,704 --> 00:17:33,372
I'll, uh, let you know
if I need anything.

406
00:17:34,275 --> 00:17:35,974
Oh, I work without a shirt.

407
00:17:35,976 --> 00:17:38,911
Sometimes makes me feel
closer to the numbers.

408
00:17:38,913 --> 00:17:42,147
You'll need to, uh,
check the printer in the study

409
00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:43,615
for more pages.

410
00:17:43,617 --> 00:17:45,417
Uh, this is nice,
you know?

411
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:47,452
Meeting another member
of the team.

412
00:17:47,454 --> 00:17:48,654
You know, Team Sherlock.

413
00:17:48,656 --> 00:17:50,656
You help him, I help him...

414
00:17:51,926 --> 00:17:53,559
Obviously, you haven't
tackled a case

415
00:17:53,561 --> 00:17:55,093
with high-order math since
you started working with him,

416
00:17:55,095 --> 00:17:57,729
or we would've...

417
00:17:57,731 --> 00:17:59,031
What?

418
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:00,232
What?

419
00:18:00,234 --> 00:18:01,834
Wait...

420
00:18:01,836 --> 00:18:04,002
have you worked a case
with high-order math?

421
00:18:04,805 --> 00:18:06,238
You have, haven't you?

422
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,840
Does it matter?

423
00:18:07,842 --> 00:18:09,842
Of course it...

424
00:18:09,844 --> 00:18:11,443
Oh, my God.

425
00:18:11,445 --> 00:18:13,278
Did he fire me?

426
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,980
All I know
is that back in London,

427
00:18:14,982 --> 00:18:16,982
we worked a case that involved
Fibonacci spirals...

428
00:18:16,984 --> 00:18:18,483
He fired me.

429
00:18:18,485 --> 00:18:21,386
...and he called some woman
named Indira Patel.

430
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,856
She's at Berkeley.

431
00:18:23,858 --> 00:18:25,624
I'm three time zones closer!

432
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:27,125
You're here now.

433
00:18:27,127 --> 00:18:29,428
Sure, because I found
a dead body.

434
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,531
I have to go; I have to run
some errands for Sherlock.

435
00:18:35,936 --> 00:18:37,903
I-I don't know
what was in the crate,

436
00:18:37,905 --> 00:18:39,271
but the stenciling on
the side indicates

437
00:18:39,273 --> 00:18:40,772
it came from one of
the SUNY schools.

438
00:18:40,774 --> 00:18:42,908
I put another detective
on Keswick...

439
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:45,177
Don't kill me, I had to
use your razor to shave.

440
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:47,179
I...

441
00:18:47,181 --> 00:18:49,147
You must be Andrew.

442
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:50,515
Sherlock Holmes.

443
00:18:50,517 --> 00:18:52,551
Sorry.

444
00:18:52,553 --> 00:18:55,487
Joan said you were coming;
I... I forgot.

445
00:18:55,489 --> 00:18:57,122
It's not how
I wanted to meet you.

446
00:18:57,124 --> 00:18:58,891
She said you can tell
a lot about people

447
00:18:58,893 --> 00:19:00,192
just by looking at them.

448
00:19:00,194 --> 00:19:02,261
I swear, I...
usually wear pants.

449
00:19:02,263 --> 00:19:03,729
Well, in my experience,
most people

450
00:19:03,731 --> 00:19:05,264
need only be concerned
I won't notice

451
00:19:05,266 --> 00:19:06,498
anything worth remarking upon.

452
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:10,535
Watson seems adequately sexed.

453
00:19:11,939 --> 00:19:13,672
Hey.

454
00:19:13,674 --> 00:19:15,674
I was just introducing myself.

455
00:19:17,945 --> 00:19:20,379
I've got that thing.
I'll see you tonight.

456
00:19:20,381 --> 00:19:21,580
Okay.

457
00:19:27,855 --> 00:19:30,188
Your home, Watson...

458
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,823
it's utterly pleasant.

459
00:19:31,825 --> 00:19:33,692
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

460
00:19:33,694 --> 00:19:35,394
When you told me
you wanted a life of your own,

461
00:19:35,396 --> 00:19:36,595
I didn't realize
that you meant you wanted

462
00:19:36,597 --> 00:19:38,030
the same life everyone else has.

463
00:19:38,032 --> 00:19:39,464
But at any rate,
none of my business, is it?

464
00:19:39,466 --> 00:19:41,233
It's not.
And I didn't ask you here

465
00:19:41,235 --> 00:19:42,634
to talk about my apartment.

466
00:19:42,636 --> 00:19:44,970
No, you asked me here
to discuss Kitty.

467
00:19:44,972 --> 00:19:46,471
If she were not
the topic of conversation,

468
00:19:46,473 --> 00:19:48,941
then you wouldn't have
invited me to your home,

469
00:19:48,943 --> 00:19:50,776
where there's no chance
she'll be present.

470
00:19:52,346 --> 00:19:53,946
She disappointed you
in some way.

471
00:19:53,948 --> 00:19:55,247
Skills not up to snuff?

472
00:19:55,249 --> 00:19:57,316
Please remember
she is a novice.

473
00:19:57,318 --> 00:19:58,850
Actually, she did a great job.

474
00:19:58,852 --> 00:20:00,285
But I have some concerns.

475
00:20:00,287 --> 00:20:01,954
I thought we could
talk about them.

476
00:20:03,757 --> 00:20:04,923
You think that
Kitty needs help

477
00:20:04,925 --> 00:20:06,091
above and beyond
my mentorship.

478
00:20:06,093 --> 00:20:07,392
You read the same
file I did.

479
00:20:07,394 --> 00:20:08,894
She's a rape victim.

480
00:20:08,896 --> 00:20:11,296
She was kept and tortured.

481
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,899
Mm.

482
00:20:16,136 --> 00:20:19,171
You know me, so surely you know

483
00:20:19,173 --> 00:20:22,874
I've broached the subject of
a support group meeting before.

484
00:20:22,876 --> 00:20:25,010
Even offered
to pay for therapy.

485
00:20:25,012 --> 00:20:26,812
She's not interested, I know.

486
00:20:26,814 --> 00:20:28,447
Just as you also know

487
00:20:28,449 --> 00:20:30,749
someone with a problem
can't be forced to get help.

488
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:32,551
They have to want it.

489
00:20:32,553 --> 00:20:34,786
What Kitty wants
is to be a detective.

490
00:20:36,523 --> 00:20:38,490
I am taking pains
to try and channel

491
00:20:38,492 --> 00:20:40,592
her residual feelings
into her work.

492
00:20:42,329 --> 00:20:44,463
Well, that works out
great for you.

493
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:48,400
You told me that
you took on a partner

494
00:20:48,402 --> 00:20:50,635
because you wanted to replicate
what you and I had.

495
00:20:50,637 --> 00:20:52,637
That you thought it helped
with your recovery.

496
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:54,539
You think I would
try and take advantage

497
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,208
of the victim of a trauma?

498
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,910
Of course not, but there is
a conflict of interest here.

499
00:20:58,912 --> 00:21:02,447
She needs what she needs,
but you need what you need, too.

500
00:21:06,053 --> 00:21:10,055
It's-it's good that you're
in her life now, Watson.

501
00:21:10,057 --> 00:21:12,524
I mean,
it's commonly believed that, um,

502
00:21:12,526 --> 00:21:16,228
a child benefits mostly from
the presence of two parents.

503
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,164
He-- or she, in this case--
can absorb certain qualities

504
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,466
from the father--
clear-eyed view of the world,

505
00:21:21,468 --> 00:21:23,168
capacity of
rational thought, etcetera.

506
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,170
They can also absorb certain
qualities from the mother.

507
00:21:25,172 --> 00:21:27,105
Excuse me, but I am not
Kitty's mother,

508
00:21:27,107 --> 00:21:28,807
and she sure as hell
is not our child.

509
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:30,942
You brought her here;
she looks up to you.

510
00:21:30,944 --> 00:21:32,944
She says that she doesn't
need help-- fine--

511
00:21:32,946 --> 00:21:34,579
but you know better.

512
00:21:34,581 --> 00:21:37,082
And you're gonna have to be
the one that tells her.

513
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,620
It's Harlan.

514
00:21:41,622 --> 00:21:44,523
Making progress with the maths.

515
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,660
We thought
that Byron and Ike

516
00:21:48,662 --> 00:21:50,462
arrived at Portal Ten
simultaneously.

517
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,664
That would've meant that they
were doing all the same math

518
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,032
at essentially
the same time.

519
00:21:54,034 --> 00:21:56,001
Only, the math
you found at Byron's place

520
00:21:56,003 --> 00:21:57,003
says that's wrong.

521
00:21:57,004 --> 00:21:58,470
He was one step behind Ike.

522
00:21:58,472 --> 00:22:00,705
Are you proposing he did
not kill Mr. Walaczek?

523
00:22:00,707 --> 00:22:03,175
I don't know, but that's
not the weirdest part.

524
00:22:03,177 --> 00:22:04,810
Byron was obsessive.

525
00:22:04,812 --> 00:22:06,211
He time-stamped
almost everything he did.

526
00:22:06,213 --> 00:22:09,047
He only solved
the Portal Nine problem,

527
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:11,316
the same problem that sent me
to that old factory last night.

528
00:22:11,318 --> 00:22:12,884
But get this--

529
00:22:12,886 --> 00:22:14,686
he wasn't given
the same problem as me.

530
00:22:14,688 --> 00:22:16,655
And so it would've yielded
GPS coordinates

531
00:22:16,657 --> 00:22:18,323
for an entirely
different location.

532
00:22:18,325 --> 00:22:21,760
The person in charge of
the game changed the clue

533
00:22:21,762 --> 00:22:23,328
after the police
found Ike's body.

534
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:25,964
Well, he had to, right?

535
00:22:25,966 --> 00:22:27,899
If he hadn't, he would be
sending other competitors

536
00:22:27,901 --> 00:22:29,101
to an active crime scene.

537
00:22:29,103 --> 00:22:30,402
The important thing is

538
00:22:30,404 --> 00:22:31,536
I figured out the coordinates

539
00:22:31,538 --> 00:22:32,771
to the second location.

540
00:22:32,773 --> 00:22:35,540
I know where Byron went.

541
00:22:35,542 --> 00:22:36,842
What are you doing?

542
00:22:36,844 --> 00:22:38,410
You're saying he
time-stamped everything.

543
00:22:38,412 --> 00:22:40,345
I'm looking at the time
he received his clues.

544
00:22:40,347 --> 00:22:42,647
It's all there, to the second,
but what does that have to do...

545
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:44,149
What if you hadn't
found a body?

546
00:22:44,151 --> 00:22:46,118
If the game had
proceeded as planned,

547
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,486
what were you meant
to do there?

548
00:22:47,488 --> 00:22:49,354
I would have sent a text
to the phone number,

549
00:22:49,356 --> 00:22:51,523
the one that the killer painted
over, and then I would have

550
00:22:51,525 --> 00:22:52,891
gotten a message back
with the next problem.

551
00:22:52,893 --> 00:22:54,559
There's an extra
step in there.

552
00:22:54,561 --> 00:22:56,428
Why all this rigmarole with
phone numbers and texts?

553
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,064
Why not just post the problem
itself at the factory?

554
00:22:59,066 --> 00:23:02,100
I don't know, it's just the way
the game is played.

555
00:23:02,102 --> 00:23:04,102
They're for an old
industrial area in Queens.

556
00:23:04,104 --> 00:23:06,805
You're welcome
for finding your suspect.

557
00:23:06,807 --> 00:23:09,207
If I'm right, Harlan,
what you've found...

558
00:23:09,209 --> 00:23:11,109
is the site of
another murder.

559
00:23:11,111 --> 00:23:13,245
Byron Lowenthal's.

560
00:23:15,983 --> 00:23:18,216
You were right,
Lowenthal's dead.

561
00:23:18,218 --> 00:23:20,952
He was shot in the foot,
then the knee.

562
00:23:20,954 --> 00:23:22,821
Just like
Ike Wallaczek.

563
00:23:22,823 --> 00:23:26,391
I'm, uh, gonna look
over here now.

564
00:23:26,393 --> 00:23:29,427
Well, we think the perp
was pulling the body

565
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:31,429
to a car that was parked
over there.

566
00:23:31,431 --> 00:23:34,065
Then he just
left him here.

567
00:23:34,067 --> 00:23:35,901
Probably afraid
he'd been spotted.

568
00:23:35,903 --> 00:23:38,803
There's a lot
of homeless in the area.

569
00:23:41,441 --> 00:23:43,008
Question is:

570
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:45,010
how'd you know
Lowenthal was the next victim

571
00:23:45,012 --> 00:23:46,511
and not the killer?

572
00:23:49,316 --> 00:23:51,750
Well, that's
quite simple, really.

573
00:23:51,752 --> 00:23:54,352
The game is directing
its players to remote locales,

574
00:23:54,354 --> 00:23:56,788
and then instructing them
to send a text message

575
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,256
indicating their presence.

576
00:23:58,258 --> 00:24:00,125
I suspect the killer wanted
to remove the body

577
00:24:00,127 --> 00:24:02,928
so he could keep this new
location “in play,” so to speak.

578
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:05,130
Still missing the “simple” part.

579
00:24:05,132 --> 00:24:06,698
The late Mr. Lowenthal

580
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,366
received his final clue

581
00:24:08,368 --> 00:24:10,235
after Harlan discovered
Ike Wallaczek's body,

582
00:24:10,237 --> 00:24:12,737
but before news of the killing
had reached the media.

583
00:24:12,739 --> 00:24:14,439
That means the
game's designer

584
00:24:14,441 --> 00:24:16,408
knew the location
had been compromised.

585
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,577
And the only way
that he could have known that,

586
00:24:18,579 --> 00:24:20,111
at the time that he knew it,

587
00:24:20,113 --> 00:24:21,880
was if he, himself,
was the killer.

588
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,917
Belphegor's Prime is not
a treasure hunt.

589
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,619
It's a trap.

590
00:24:40,696 --> 00:24:42,196
Better?

591
00:24:42,198 --> 00:24:44,665
False alarm.

592
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:47,668
But I still feel
a little queasy.

593
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,273
This new dead guy--

594
00:24:52,275 --> 00:24:54,875
your friend said that he was
tortured, too, right?

595
00:24:54,877 --> 00:24:57,244
Right before the killer tried
to abscond with his corpse.

596
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:59,213
I assume
he intended to take

597
00:24:59,215 --> 00:25:02,383
Ike Wallaczek away with him
as well, only Ike was too large.

598
00:25:02,385 --> 00:25:04,685
A speedy mothballing
was the best he could do.

599
00:25:04,687 --> 00:25:07,221
So, just to recap,

600
00:25:07,223 --> 00:25:09,657
I've spent the last
few months of my life

601
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:13,360
playing a game that was
designed to kill me.

602
00:25:13,362 --> 00:25:15,629
Got to be a metaphor
in there somewhere, right?

603
00:25:15,631 --> 00:25:18,966
I think the word you're
looking for is “moral.”

604
00:25:18,968 --> 00:25:21,902
There is a moral in there:
games are for idiots.

605
00:25:24,707 --> 00:25:26,473
Breaking news from Ramapo.

606
00:25:26,475 --> 00:25:29,443
Kitty reports the Center for
Applied Mathematics and Logic

607
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,912
is not the sponsor
of Belphegor's Prime.

608
00:25:31,914 --> 00:25:34,148
Then it's got to be
a serial killer, right?

609
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,716
Someone who's obsessed
with mathematicians?

610
00:25:35,718 --> 00:25:37,284
Mm.

611
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,920
Perhaps he was bullied
by mathematicians as a child.

612
00:25:39,922 --> 00:25:42,056
Or mathematicians
killed his parents.

613
00:25:42,058 --> 00:25:43,657
I'm being serious.

614
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:45,726
Serial killers who devise
elaborate death traps

615
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,461
are the stuff of pulp fiction.

616
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:49,229
And besides, with respect
to these murders,

617
00:25:49,231 --> 00:25:51,165
there are none
of the elaborations

618
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:53,767
which mark that sort of culprit.

619
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:55,970
If anything, I would describe
the work as businesslike.

620
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:58,172
Then it's the government.

621
00:25:58,174 --> 00:26:01,241
I mean, the-the game was some
sort of test to weed out people

622
00:26:01,243 --> 00:26:03,243
who could weaponize math.

623
00:26:03,245 --> 00:26:05,179
The American intelligence
apparatus may be clod-like,

624
00:26:05,181 --> 00:26:07,014
but I think they would
do a better job

625
00:26:07,016 --> 00:26:08,749
of disposing of two bodies,
don't you?

626
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:11,785
Watson?

627
00:26:11,787 --> 00:26:13,621
I just heard
from one of the suspects

628
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:14,922
Marcus and I talked to
yesterday,

629
00:26:14,924 --> 00:26:16,290
another puzzle-hunter.

630
00:26:16,292 --> 00:26:18,525
Tell me he confessed
to the murders.

631
00:26:18,527 --> 00:26:20,427
We ruled him out right away,
but he heard about

632
00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:22,329
Byron Lowenthal's murder on
the news and wanted me to know

633
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:25,165
he's at a friend's place,
some guy named Paul.

634
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,934
That is fascinating.

635
00:26:26,936 --> 00:26:28,369
Actually, it might be.

636
00:26:28,371 --> 00:26:31,038
Paul is positive he knows
who the killer is.

637
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,807
I know the guards
are a bit much,

638
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:35,509
but I wanted everyone
to feel safe.

639
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:38,178
And, besides,
math has been good to me.

640
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,279
Commodities.

641
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:40,848
So, you and your friends,

642
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:43,150
you were competitors
in Belphegor's Prime?

643
00:26:43,152 --> 00:26:45,352
Most of us. Some of the others
are just here for the math.

644
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,121
You said you could
identify the killer.

645
00:26:47,123 --> 00:26:49,323
I can, sort of.

646
00:26:52,061 --> 00:26:54,194
“Mo Shellshocker.”

647
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:56,930
It's a pseudonym,
obviously, but I'm telling you,

648
00:26:56,932 --> 00:26:58,365
this is the guy
you're looking for.

649
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,600
I've heard of him.

650
00:26:59,602 --> 00:27:01,335
He uses his blog
to expose bad math.

651
00:27:01,337 --> 00:27:03,837
Corrupt economists, biased
pollsters, that sort of thing.

652
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:05,572
He's actually
sort of a crusader.

653
00:27:05,574 --> 00:27:06,574
He's a murderer.

654
00:27:06,575 --> 00:27:09,143
How can you be
so sure?

655
00:27:09,145 --> 00:27:10,744
When he isn't crusading,
he's competing in puzzle hunts.

656
00:27:10,746 --> 00:27:11,812
A few months ago,

657
00:27:11,814 --> 00:27:13,080
he claimed to
have solved

658
00:27:13,082 --> 00:27:14,815
Cicada 3301 two
years in a row.

659
00:27:14,817 --> 00:27:17,484
Some people called BS,
including...

660
00:27:17,486 --> 00:27:20,120
Ike Wallaczek
and Byron Lowenthal.

661
00:27:20,122 --> 00:27:21,221
“WallaCheckYourMath,”

662
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:22,489
“ByLow2020.”

663
00:27:22,491 --> 00:27:23,757
Those are their
online handles.

664
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:25,392
Their friends
will confirm it.

665
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,528
A flame war does not
a murderer make.

666
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:30,097
The stuff these guys were
slinging at each other was ugly.

667
00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:32,099
Mo knew they were into hunts,
and so he built one

668
00:27:32,101 --> 00:27:34,034
that would send them to places
where he could kill them.

669
00:27:34,036 --> 00:27:35,469
That's what we're
doing here is

670
00:27:35,471 --> 00:27:36,837
we're just sifting
through all the math

671
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:38,338
he's posted on his blog
over the years,

672
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,840
to see if we could
find his signature

673
00:27:39,842 --> 00:27:41,975
or something that
could identify him.

674
00:27:41,977 --> 00:27:45,279
If two people weren't dead,
we'd probably be having fun.

675
00:27:45,281 --> 00:27:46,747
But still, the
chances that he left

676
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:48,582
something like that
in his math...

677
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,784
If it's there, we'll find it.
In the meantime,

678
00:27:50,786 --> 00:27:52,186
we thought the
police should know

679
00:27:52,188 --> 00:27:53,687
who they're really
dealing with.

680
00:27:53,689 --> 00:27:55,389
<i>I've got to go meet someone</i>

681
00:27:55,391 --> 00:27:56,924
about my other case.

682
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:59,927
You're good to pass all this
along to Marcus? Okay.

683
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:03,030
I must say, I'm surprised you
didn't offer to stay and help.

684
00:28:03,032 --> 00:28:05,265
Mr. Ettinger makes
a compelling case with respect

685
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,067
to Mo Shellshocker's
viability as a suspect.

686
00:28:07,069 --> 00:28:09,002
Mo is a genius.

687
00:28:09,004 --> 00:28:10,637
We're talking off the charts.

688
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:12,139
Leibniz meets Euler meets Gauss.

689
00:28:12,141 --> 00:28:14,108
Huh.
He may have an ego,

690
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,110
but he's not gonna kill
anyone over a few comments.

691
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:18,312
So, while “The League of
Concerned Mathematician”"

692
00:28:18,314 --> 00:28:21,014
chases its tail up there, I
am gonna do the smart thing

693
00:28:21,016 --> 00:28:22,416
and get out of town.

694
00:28:22,418 --> 00:28:24,485
You can let me know
when it all blows over.

695
00:28:24,487 --> 00:28:26,386
You're not going
anywhere, Harlan.

696
00:28:26,388 --> 00:28:29,223
Or should I call you
Mo Shellshocker?

697
00:28:32,728 --> 00:28:34,661
Did you honestly think
I wouldn't recognize

698
00:28:34,663 --> 00:28:36,130
an anagram of my own name?

699
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:40,567
I knew I should've gone
with “Choker Hell Moss”"

700
00:28:40,569 --> 00:28:42,569
But I never thought
that you would see it, okay?

701
00:28:42,571 --> 00:28:44,104
Math is my thing, not yours.

702
00:28:44,106 --> 00:28:46,473
It's my name, Harlan;
that makes it my thing.

703
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,675
It was an homage.

704
00:28:48,677 --> 00:28:50,043
Explain.

705
00:28:50,045 --> 00:28:52,045
Every day, all over the world,

706
00:28:52,047 --> 00:28:54,348
math is used to trick people.

707
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,917
Data dredging to sell
pharmaceuticals.

708
00:28:56,919 --> 00:28:59,720
Publication bias
to justify wars.

709
00:28:59,722 --> 00:29:02,322
In the wrong hands, math can be
manipulated, abused.

710
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:05,425
And I decided to do
something about it.

711
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:09,596
You catch people
who murder other people.

712
00:29:09,598 --> 00:29:11,431
I catch people who murder math.

713
00:29:11,433 --> 00:29:14,568
According to this,
Mo is a wanted man.

714
00:29:17,606 --> 00:29:19,940
Harlan?

715
00:29:19,942 --> 00:29:23,110
The D.O.D. was working
on a new fighter.

716
00:29:23,112 --> 00:29:27,047
Only, I knew that the
performance stats were bogus.

717
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:29,116
A friend of mine found
the internal numbers,

718
00:29:29,118 --> 00:29:31,251
and I sort of published them.

719
00:29:31,253 --> 00:29:33,320
So you put classified
Department of Defense documents

720
00:29:33,322 --> 00:29:34,888
on the Internet.

721
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:36,623
Isn't that what
you would have done?

722
00:29:38,928 --> 00:29:41,562
Fine! I screwed up, okay?

723
00:29:41,564 --> 00:29:43,730
But, hey, that's what I do,
right? I screw up.

724
00:29:43,732 --> 00:29:46,233
If I didn't, then probably you
wouldn't have secretly fired me.

725
00:29:46,235 --> 00:29:47,968
Excuse me?

726
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,403
I know about Indira Patel!

727
00:29:51,006 --> 00:29:53,340
I know you replaced me.

728
00:29:55,144 --> 00:29:58,979
Kitty, I think
we could use some tea.

729
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:04,318
Just tell me.

730
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,253
Tell me what math I got wrong.

731
00:30:06,255 --> 00:30:09,356
Tell me why you didn't let me
make it up to you.

732
00:30:09,358 --> 00:30:12,926
It wasn't the maths, it was you.

733
00:30:14,763 --> 00:30:18,232
Your work was impeccable.

734
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:20,334
And for the most part,
I enjoyed our collaborations.

735
00:30:20,336 --> 00:30:24,838
B-But over time, you just...
you became quite... needy.

736
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,406
What are you talking about?

737
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:29,109
Y-You asked my advice
on-on social matters,

738
00:30:29,111 --> 00:30:32,512
and you even invited me
to a party.

739
00:30:32,514 --> 00:30:34,648
You were my friend.

740
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,416
I was your employer, Harlan.

741
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:37,918
A-And you were my consultant.

742
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,419
One of many.

743
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:43,757
I know that I'm a little
obsessed with what I do.

744
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:46,960
That has always made it hard
to make friends.

745
00:30:46,962 --> 00:30:50,664
And I used to feel pretty bad
about that, and then I met you.

746
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:52,566
And I thought to myself,

747
00:30:52,568 --> 00:30:55,903
hey, if it doesn't bother him,
why should I let it bother me?

748
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:03,810
I got a lot
out of the work that we did.

749
00:31:03,812 --> 00:31:06,146
A lot.

750
00:31:06,148 --> 00:31:11,218
But if someone like you thinks
that I'm a loser, then...

751
00:31:22,564 --> 00:31:24,965
Hey, are we still doing this?

752
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:26,366
Doing what?

753
00:31:26,368 --> 00:31:28,502
Talking about the case.

754
00:31:28,504 --> 00:31:30,070
You're just sitting there.

755
00:31:30,072 --> 00:31:32,105
I'm thinking.

756
00:31:32,107 --> 00:31:34,308
I suspect the silence
is exacerbated

757
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,143
by the nature
of our communication.

758
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:37,811
Yes. Well, I don't
live there anymore.

759
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,713
So, if you want
to talk shop at night,

760
00:31:39,715 --> 00:31:41,515
this is the best I can do.

761
00:31:41,517 --> 00:31:45,252
Keep asking myself:
what did the killer want?

762
00:31:45,254 --> 00:31:48,255
He went to great lengths to lure
brilliant mathematicians

763
00:31:48,257 --> 00:31:49,489
to their deaths.

764
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,525
Winnowed out
the less gifted

765
00:31:51,527 --> 00:31:54,061
by making his problems
more and more complicated.

766
00:31:54,063 --> 00:31:57,597
He had a type, but I still think
he's a serial killer

767
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:59,266
only in the most
technical sense.

768
00:31:59,268 --> 00:32:01,201
He tortured both his victims.

769
00:32:01,203 --> 00:32:02,936
But there's no sign
that he enjoyed it.

770
00:32:02,938 --> 00:32:04,538
The work was
utilitarian,

771
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,740
suggesting it was
less for pleasure

772
00:32:06,742 --> 00:32:10,043
and more for persuasion.

773
00:32:10,045 --> 00:32:11,945
He wanted something.

774
00:32:11,947 --> 00:32:13,714
But what?

775
00:32:13,716 --> 00:32:16,483
Maybe there's a connection
between Wallaczek and Lowenthal

776
00:32:16,485 --> 00:32:18,418
we haven't spotted yet.

777
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,220
Maybe they were working
on a project together,

778
00:32:20,222 --> 00:32:21,822
something that was worth
a lot of money.

779
00:32:21,824 --> 00:32:23,857
There's no way the killer
could have predicted

780
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:26,093
which competitors would make it
to the terminal stage.

781
00:32:26,095 --> 00:32:28,795
That part of the game
was beyond his control.

782
00:32:28,797 --> 00:32:30,664
If it weren't,
he would've been prepared

783
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:33,300
to dispose of a body
the size of Ike Wallaczek's.

784
00:32:33,302 --> 00:32:35,335
So, even if there were a
connection between the victims,

785
00:32:35,337 --> 00:32:37,070
the killer could not
have counted on them

786
00:32:37,072 --> 00:32:38,839
being lured into his trap.

787
00:32:38,841 --> 00:32:41,041
Certainly not
in sequence.

788
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:45,112
His game was, in many respects,
one of chance.

789
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:51,718
Suggesting he knows what
he wants, but not who has it.

790
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,888
Like he was on a puzzle hunt
of his own.

791
00:32:56,825 --> 00:32:58,859
I'm back.

792
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:05,665
I'll set up
downstairs, yeah?

793
00:33:09,138 --> 00:33:11,238
I've been thinking about
what you said earlier.

794
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,740
I've decided to engage her
one more time

795
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:15,609
with regards
to her recuperation.

796
00:33:17,112 --> 00:33:21,815
I doubt she'll listen,
but I'll keep you apprised.

797
00:33:25,954 --> 00:33:27,421
I've been thinking.

798
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:29,623
About?
You. Your history.

799
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:31,825
Your decision
not to seek help.

800
00:33:31,827 --> 00:33:34,594
I think it's
a mistake.

801
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,530
Oh?

802
00:33:36,532 --> 00:33:38,198
I've looked into a number
of support groups.

803
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,633
As you are well aware,

804
00:33:39,635 --> 00:33:41,701
I have benefited greatly
from similar settings.

805
00:33:41,703 --> 00:33:43,270
You have.

806
00:33:43,272 --> 00:33:44,638
The process, I find,

807
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,906
is not unlike
voiding one's bowels...

808
00:33:45,908 --> 00:33:47,808
I'll go.
What?

809
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:49,676
I'll go.
Just get me the details.

810
00:33:52,014 --> 00:33:55,182
I've been thinking, too-- about
your number-cruncher, Harlan.

811
00:33:55,184 --> 00:33:57,017
You think I was
too hard on him.

812
00:33:57,019 --> 00:33:58,685
You will have consultants
of your own one day.

813
00:33:58,687 --> 00:34:01,488
You'll see that they require
management and focus.

814
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:04,124
They are but keys on a keyboard,
and we're the typists.

815
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:06,159
You could've given him
a shoeing for all I care.

816
00:34:06,161 --> 00:34:07,828
No, I'm just saying that

817
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:10,030
some of the stuff he's got
up to, it's quite good.

818
00:34:10,032 --> 00:34:11,698
You should take a look.

819
00:34:13,368 --> 00:34:15,735
You may find a fellow typist.

820
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,076
Hello?

821
00:34:23,078 --> 00:34:25,312
Yeah, I
hear that you and some friends

822
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:27,848
are trying to identify
Mo Shellshocker.

823
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,649
That's right. Who is this?

824
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:32,719
His name is Harlan Emple.

825
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:34,020
You got a pen?

826
00:34:34,022 --> 00:34:36,456
I'll-I'll give you his address.

827
00:34:52,454 --> 00:34:54,020
Harlan.

828
00:34:54,022 --> 00:34:56,356
You can't take a hint, can you?

829
00:34:56,358 --> 00:34:57,657
I got your text messages.

830
00:34:57,659 --> 00:34:58,958
I don't want to see you
right now.

831
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,827
So if you came here
to apologize...

832
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:03,363
Actually, I came here
to spare you an agonizing death.

833
00:35:04,299 --> 00:35:05,832
Can I come in?

834
00:35:05,834 --> 00:35:08,301
I was puzzling earlier

835
00:35:08,303 --> 00:35:12,038
as to why the killer went
to such specific lengths.

836
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,606
What did he want?

837
00:35:13,608 --> 00:35:15,809
And then Watson,
quite by accident,

838
00:35:15,811 --> 00:35:17,410
she made a most
compelling analogy.

839
00:35:17,412 --> 00:35:20,080
She said it was as if he
was on a hunt of his own.

840
00:35:20,082 --> 00:35:22,615
Duh. He was hunting
mathematicians.

841
00:35:22,617 --> 00:35:23,783
No, he wasn't.

842
00:35:23,785 --> 00:35:25,151
He was hunting<i> a</i> mathematician.

843
00:35:25,153 --> 00:35:26,619
One.

844
00:35:26,621 --> 00:35:29,389
A man who had concealed
his identity not only

845
00:35:29,391 --> 00:35:31,191
from the mathematics
community at large,

846
00:35:31,193 --> 00:35:32,859
but also from the FBI.

847
00:35:32,861 --> 00:35:35,395
A “crusader,”
you might call him.

848
00:35:35,397 --> 00:35:36,763
Wait a minute.

849
00:35:36,765 --> 00:35:38,731
Are you saying that
this was all about me?

850
00:35:53,448 --> 00:35:56,449
<i> Unfortunately, emulating</i>
<i>the work of people like me</i>

851
00:35:56,451 --> 00:35:59,018
<i>is not without risks.</i>

852
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,320
Creates enemies.

853
00:36:00,322 --> 00:36:02,889
I knew it was the government.

854
00:36:02,891 --> 00:36:04,424
It was a lottery winner.

855
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,260
Little over a year ago,

856
00:36:07,262 --> 00:36:09,529
you started a series of blogs
where you exposed the flaws

857
00:36:09,531 --> 00:36:11,664
in certain scratch card
lottery games.

858
00:36:11,666 --> 00:36:13,766
Tickets like this one.

859
00:36:13,768 --> 00:36:15,802
I wrote about
baited hook games.

860
00:36:15,804 --> 00:36:17,971
Games where the numbers
are printed on the front.

861
00:36:17,973 --> 00:36:20,707
Scratch off the hidden numbers,
hope for a match.

862
00:36:20,709 --> 00:36:23,309
Only, you proved that with
careful mathematical analysis

863
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:25,512
of the visible numbers,
you could predict

864
00:36:25,514 --> 00:36:28,381
which tickets were winners
80% of the time.

865
00:36:28,383 --> 00:36:29,682
If you had exploited

866
00:36:29,684 --> 00:36:32,085
this flaw,
rather than exposing it,

867
00:36:32,087 --> 00:36:33,520
you could have made millions.

868
00:36:33,522 --> 00:36:36,022
Well... sure.
But that would been cheating.

869
00:36:36,024 --> 00:36:37,157
Right.

870
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:38,825
So imagine
for a moment

871
00:36:38,827 --> 00:36:41,060
that you are a less
honest mathematician.

872
00:36:41,062 --> 00:36:42,495
Right?

873
00:36:42,497 --> 00:36:44,063
You've been taking
advantage of these games

874
00:36:44,065 --> 00:36:47,967
for a couple of years to
amass a small fortune.

875
00:36:47,969 --> 00:36:49,502
And then “Mo"
comes along.

876
00:36:49,504 --> 00:36:51,971
He starts exposing
the broken games.

877
00:36:51,973 --> 00:36:54,340
State lottery commissions
shut them down.

878
00:36:54,342 --> 00:36:56,976
The exploitable
games dry up.

879
00:36:56,978 --> 00:37:00,613
Now, if you were a
psychopathic lottery cheat,

880
00:37:00,615 --> 00:37:02,582
how do you fix that?

881
00:37:02,584 --> 00:37:04,484
You kill Mo.

882
00:37:04,486 --> 00:37:07,253
<i>Unfortunately, Mo is elusive.</i>

883
00:37:07,255 --> 00:37:08,821
<i>Anonymous.</i>

884
00:37:08,823 --> 00:37:11,224
The only thing
he knew about him for sure

885
00:37:11,226 --> 00:37:14,394
was that he could not resist
a puzzle hunt.

886
00:37:14,396 --> 00:37:17,130
Now, if you were smart enough
to identify

887
00:37:17,132 --> 00:37:19,399
and take advantage of
broken lottery games...

888
00:37:19,401 --> 00:37:21,868
Then I'm smart enough
to design a puzzle hunt.

889
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:25,338
This plan was not
without its flaws.

890
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:28,775
Once a competitor
reached the terminal stage,

891
00:37:28,777 --> 00:37:32,745
the killer could not be certain
that he'd trapped Mo, could he?

892
00:37:32,747 --> 00:37:34,480
So he tortured them.

893
00:37:34,482 --> 00:37:37,083
I submit he forced them to
log on to Mo's Web site,

894
00:37:37,085 --> 00:37:39,686
and when they failed...

895
00:37:41,323 --> 00:37:42,755
After two murders,

896
00:37:42,757 --> 00:37:44,290
the game was compromised.

897
00:37:44,292 --> 00:37:46,192
So the killer devises
a Plan “B.”

898
00:37:46,194 --> 00:37:47,460
He tricks

899
00:37:47,462 --> 00:37:49,229
a group of his peers

900
00:37:49,231 --> 00:37:51,097
into helping search
for an alternative means

901
00:37:51,099 --> 00:37:53,032
of identifying Mo.

902
00:37:56,504 --> 00:37:58,438
You're talking about that guy.

903
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,906
The one with the penthouse.

904
00:37:59,908 --> 00:38:02,742
<i>Paul?</i>

905
00:38:02,744 --> 00:38:05,044
Lottery winners
are public record.

906
00:38:05,046 --> 00:38:07,814
So when I searched for
the names of repeat winners

907
00:38:07,816 --> 00:38:09,482
in the dates prior
to your posts...

908
00:38:09,484 --> 00:38:11,317
I can't believe
I drank his water.

909
00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:12,685
I called him.

910
00:38:12,687 --> 00:38:14,654
I identified you as Mo.

911
00:38:14,656 --> 00:38:16,122
And I gave him your address.

912
00:38:16,124 --> 00:38:17,590
You what?!

913
00:38:21,129 --> 00:38:23,062
Drop your weapon!

914
00:38:23,064 --> 00:38:24,597
<i>I did not, however, give him</i>

915
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:25,965
<i>the correct apartment number.</i>

916
00:38:25,967 --> 00:38:28,334
He was arrested
a little over an hour ago.

917
00:38:30,739 --> 00:38:31,871
Tried to call you to
tell you, but, um...

918
00:38:31,873 --> 00:38:33,539
But I was ignoring you.

919
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:35,008
Yes, you were ignoring me.

920
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,209
Look, you know

921
00:38:36,211 --> 00:38:37,377
that I'm still screwed, right?

922
00:38:37,379 --> 00:38:39,279
You told him that I'm Mo.

923
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:42,115
He's gonna tell the police,
they're gonna tell the FBI...

924
00:38:42,117 --> 00:38:43,516
The NYPD is under
the impression

925
00:38:43,518 --> 00:38:45,385
that I lied about
your connection to Mo

926
00:38:45,387 --> 00:38:47,920
in order to draw
Mr. Ettinger out.

927
00:38:47,922 --> 00:38:49,555
As far as the
FBI goes, well,

928
00:38:49,557 --> 00:38:51,958
I've got some associates
who have created a trail

929
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,860
which will
strongly suggest that Mo

930
00:38:53,862 --> 00:38:55,728
is a cyber-terrorist
I became aware of

931
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:58,197
whilst working for, um...

932
00:38:58,199 --> 00:38:59,766
queen and country.

933
00:38:59,768 --> 00:39:02,135
Your secret's
quite safe.

934
00:39:02,137 --> 00:39:03,903
Thanks.

935
00:39:06,508 --> 00:39:09,776
My reasons for preserving you
are entirely selfish, Harlan.

936
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:13,279
You are a tremendous asset.

937
00:39:13,281 --> 00:39:15,815
I have little doubt

938
00:39:15,817 --> 00:39:19,118
I will need your help again
in the future.

939
00:39:26,461 --> 00:39:28,528
Me or him?

940
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:29,996
You.

941
00:39:29,998 --> 00:39:31,798
I have an update on
that real estate flipper.

942
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,433
I thought you might
want to know.

943
00:39:39,274 --> 00:39:41,908
I tracked down the truck rental
receipts to get her name.

944
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,142
Valerie Cork.

945
00:39:43,144 --> 00:39:44,911
She's an art authenticator.

946
00:39:44,913 --> 00:39:46,779
And that crate you saw?

947
00:39:46,781 --> 00:39:48,414
There was
something called

948
00:39:48,416 --> 00:39:50,683
a scanning fluorescence
spectrometry machine inside.

949
00:39:50,685 --> 00:39:52,251
They're used...
To find paintings

950
00:39:52,253 --> 00:39:53,553
underneath other paintings.

951
00:39:53,555 --> 00:39:55,288
So it turns out
that the building

952
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:56,689
Chad Keswick was looking to buy

953
00:39:56,691 --> 00:39:59,025
was leased by the WPA
during the Depression.

954
00:39:59,027 --> 00:40:00,927
They commissioned a
mural for the lobby.

955
00:40:00,929 --> 00:40:03,329
The artist was a
notorious communist,

956
00:40:03,331 --> 00:40:05,365
so when the property passed
into private hands in the '50s,

957
00:40:05,367 --> 00:40:06,999
the new owners
had it painted over.

958
00:40:07,001 --> 00:40:08,735
But it was still there,
under the paint.

959
00:40:08,737 --> 00:40:11,037
A lost work by Diego Rivera.

960
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:13,473
It's worth ten times
the price of the building.

961
00:40:14,676 --> 00:40:17,043
I was hoping to leak
the truth to the<i> Times.</i>

962
00:40:18,113 --> 00:40:20,046
I promised you a cut of my fee.

963
00:40:20,048 --> 00:40:22,148
But I'm pretty sure
the mural's gonna end up

964
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:24,384
in the hands of
a historical trust.

965
00:40:24,386 --> 00:40:26,352
I'd feel obligated
to refund my client,

966
00:40:26,354 --> 00:40:28,388
which means you'd get
a cut of nothing.

967
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:31,457
That works for me.

968
00:40:31,459 --> 00:40:33,493
Okay.

969
00:40:35,463 --> 00:40:37,397
I think you should know

970
00:40:37,399 --> 00:40:39,732
that I am going
to a meeting tonight.

971
00:40:41,803 --> 00:40:45,505
One of those
support groups for...

972
00:40:45,507 --> 00:40:47,340
people like me.

973
00:40:47,342 --> 00:40:49,876
It was, uh, Sherlock's idea.

974
00:40:49,878 --> 00:40:51,644
That's great.

975
00:40:51,646 --> 00:40:53,446
I know you put him up to it.

976
00:40:53,448 --> 00:40:55,381
We talked.

977
00:40:57,552 --> 00:41:00,219
When he first approached me
in London,

978
00:41:00,221 --> 00:41:03,556
I was...

979
00:41:03,558 --> 00:41:05,558
in a bad way.

980
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,227
And I had been for a while.

981
00:41:08,229 --> 00:41:11,130
But then,
when he talked about

982
00:41:11,132 --> 00:41:12,365
the work that he did,

983
00:41:12,367 --> 00:41:16,035
about the things
that he saw in me...

984
00:41:18,406 --> 00:41:19,739
I want it.

985
00:41:19,741 --> 00:41:21,874
I want every bit
of what's he offered me,

986
00:41:21,876 --> 00:41:23,843
of what he offered you, but...

987
00:41:23,845 --> 00:41:26,212
if I've learned one thing
over the last few weeks,

988
00:41:26,214 --> 00:41:28,047
it's that he can't pull it off.

989
00:41:28,049 --> 00:41:29,682
Not by himself, anyway.

990
00:41:31,586 --> 00:41:34,153
And if I'm gonna get
what I want,

991
00:41:34,155 --> 00:41:37,690
then I'm going to need
your help, too.

992
00:41:40,361 --> 00:41:42,829
I still think
the meetings are bollocks,

993
00:41:42,831 --> 00:41:44,931
but you say they're important.

994
00:41:44,933 --> 00:41:47,967
They matter to you, so...

995
00:41:47,969 --> 00:41:49,735
What do you say, Watson?

996
00:41:49,737 --> 00:41:52,071
Will you help me?

997
00:41:56,277 --> 00:41:58,244
I don't know how it happened.

998
00:41:58,246 --> 00:42:01,547
It just... hit me.

999
00:42:01,549 --> 00:42:03,983
Like a truck, out of nowhere.

1000
00:42:04,853 --> 00:42:07,753
Work is good.

1001
00:42:07,755 --> 00:42:09,755
I have friends.

1002
00:42:09,757 --> 00:42:13,092
I'm in a
relationship.

1003
00:42:13,094 --> 00:42:16,896
Somewhere along
the way, somehow,

1004
00:42:16,898 --> 00:42:19,732
I stopped being a victim

1005
00:42:19,734 --> 00:42:22,602
and became a survivor.

1006
00:42:22,604 --> 00:42:25,705
So, I guess all I'm saying is,
there's hope.

1007
00:42:26,357 --> 00:42:31,686
Do the work. Love yourself.
There's hope.

00:00:03,422 --> 00:00:04,761
If you're looking for Sherlock,
he's downstairs.

3
00:00:04,785 --> 00:00:05,841
Okay.

4
00:00:05,842 --> 00:00:07,541
<i>His name is Harlan Emple.</i>

5
00:00:07,543 --> 00:00:09,176
<i>He is the Rachel P. Hanson</i>
<i>Professor</i>

6
00:00:09,178 --> 00:00:11,301
for Applied Mathematics
at Columbia University.

7
00:00:11,301 --> 00:00:14,502
What I don't get is
why he isn't wearing a shirt.

8
00:00:14,504 --> 00:00:17,372
He doesn't like anything to come
between him and the numbers.

9
00:00:17,374 --> 00:00:18,415
What is it?

10
00:00:18,438 --> 00:00:20,274
The answers to your questions
about Kitty.

11
00:00:20,276 --> 00:00:22,710
The truth is she was a
victim of a horrific crime.

12
00:00:22,712 --> 00:00:24,646
<i>After you left last night,</i>

13
00:00:24,648 --> 00:00:26,848
Sherlock gave me an envelope.

14
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,249
Sherlock keeps saying

15
00:00:28,251 --> 00:00:30,385
that I need to get
a better sense of you,

16
00:00:30,387 --> 00:00:33,021
and maybe that will give you
a better sense of me.

17
00:00:42,065 --> 00:00:43,065
It's open.

18
00:00:47,637 --> 00:00:49,003
It's nothing.

19
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:50,872
It's Sherlock and
one of his experts.

20
00:00:50,874 --> 00:00:52,006
Which one?

21
00:00:52,008 --> 00:00:53,241
Phillip something.

22
00:00:53,243 --> 00:00:54,575
Must be new.

23
00:00:54,577 --> 00:00:57,445
He's a knife-thrower.

24
00:00:57,447 --> 00:00:58,913
Why does Sherlock have
a knife-thrower?

25
00:00:58,915 --> 00:01:00,748
He got bored the other day,

26
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,185
started looking into this, uh,
circus accident from the '30s.

27
00:01:04,187 --> 00:01:07,922
The Great Galardo perforated one
of his assistants during an act,

28
00:01:07,924 --> 00:01:09,924
except Sherlock thinks
the blade was thrown

29
00:01:09,926 --> 00:01:11,492
by somebody in the stands,
not Galardo.

30
00:01:11,494 --> 00:01:15,096
Phillip, as far as I
can tell, disagrees.

31
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:18,900
It can't be done, okay?

32
00:01:18,902 --> 00:01:19,934
It was done.

33
00:01:19,936 --> 00:01:21,335
You're wrong.

34
00:01:21,337 --> 00:01:23,538
Nobody can chuck
a knife that far.

35
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,239
What's this?

36
00:01:25,241 --> 00:01:26,207
You're...

37
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:27,209
Not here.

38
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,509
I'm not here.

39
00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:29,711
Remember that, okay?

40
00:01:29,713 --> 00:01:31,279
Oh, yes. Heaven
forfend your work

41
00:01:31,281 --> 00:01:33,247
with me should endanger
your precious day job.

42
00:01:33,249 --> 00:01:35,116
You throw knives?

43
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,252
You know, it was supposed
to be just you here.

44
00:01:38,254 --> 00:01:41,355
Phillip is arguably the greatest
knife-thrower in the world.

45
00:01:41,357 --> 00:01:42,790
Has been for decades.

46
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:43,925
Only, there's little money

47
00:01:43,927 --> 00:01:45,193
to be made
in the impalement arts.

48
00:01:45,195 --> 00:01:46,494
So, as a youth, he turned

49
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,563
to what you Americans
term “football”"

50
00:01:48,565 --> 00:01:50,131
Is this a joke?

51
00:01:53,837 --> 00:01:55,002
Phillip, head
and heart.

52
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:56,904
Come on.
Head and heart.

53
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:06,814
Can I go?

54
00:02:06,816 --> 00:02:09,484
Yeah.

55
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,489
15 years he spent throwing
that misshapen ball around.

56
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:16,057
15 years.

57
00:02:16,059 --> 00:02:18,259
When I think of the acclaim
he could have brought

58
00:02:18,261 --> 00:02:20,828
to competitive blade slinging.

59
00:02:27,237 --> 00:02:29,036
You're following me,
Watson.

60
00:02:29,038 --> 00:02:30,338
I don't like it.

61
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,740
I want you to help
me with something.

62
00:02:32,742 --> 00:02:33,908
This is Chad Keswick.

63
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,976
He buys distressed
buildings,

64
00:02:34,978 --> 00:02:36,210
paints, spackles,

65
00:02:36,212 --> 00:02:37,645
and then flips them
for quick money.

66
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:39,180
Who'd he kill?
No one.

67
00:02:39,182 --> 00:02:41,315
I was hired by one of
his rivals to find out

68
00:02:41,317 --> 00:02:43,017
why he's been circling
this old office building

69
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:44,218
in Jamaica, Queens.

70
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,586
She wants to know
why he thinks

71
00:02:45,588 --> 00:02:47,355
the building is
a good investment.

72
00:02:47,357 --> 00:02:49,590
Is there a crime in there,
something worth investigating?

73
00:02:49,592 --> 00:02:50,925
Well, I've been
shadowing Keswick,

74
00:02:50,927 --> 00:02:52,593
but yesterday I think
he noticed me.

75
00:02:52,595 --> 00:02:54,595
I want to switch
up the tail.

76
00:02:54,597 --> 00:02:57,231
You followed me for over
a week before I noticed you.

77
00:02:57,233 --> 00:02:59,033
Help me out, and I'll
cut you in on my fee.

78
00:02:59,035 --> 00:03:02,003
I don't work for you,
I work for Sherlock.

79
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:03,437
I worked for him, too.

80
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,773
And, in my experience,
he was always supportive

81
00:03:05,775 --> 00:03:07,942
of taking on work
outside the partnership.

82
00:03:07,944 --> 00:03:10,912
Sorry, it's not my cup of tea.

83
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:33,034
Hello, Portal Ten.

84
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,247
I'm here, Belphegor.

00:03:46,249 --> 00:03:49,784

Belphegor's Prime.

92

Think Cicada 3301

They're math games.

Math-- maybe you've heard of it.

I've got some math for you.

96
00:04:58,335 --> 00:05:00,335
One dead guy
plus one live guy

97
00:05:00,337 --> 00:05:02,104
found in the same
deserted factory.

98
00:05:02,106 --> 00:05:06,108
I was not “found” there;
I am the one who called 911.

99
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,310
I was waiting there
for the police.

100
00:05:08,312 --> 00:05:09,745
Mr. Emple,

101
00:05:09,747 --> 00:05:11,613
we're just trying
to do our jobs, all right?

102
00:05:11,615 --> 00:05:13,048
First officers
on the scene described you

103
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,516
as “extremely agitated.”

104
00:05:14,518 --> 00:05:15,984
Well, of course
I was agitated.

105
00:05:15,986 --> 00:05:18,754
I had just found
a dead guy in mothballs!

106
00:05:18,756 --> 00:05:21,790
And did I mention that I have
not slept in almost two days?

107
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:23,358
Because of the math game.

108
00:05:24,762 --> 00:05:26,195
Can I borrow those?

109
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:31,100
This...

110
00:05:31,102 --> 00:05:33,302
is Belphegor's Prime, okay?

111
00:05:33,304 --> 00:05:35,304
It's a numeric palindrome.

112
00:05:35,306 --> 00:05:40,776
It's 666 bookended by 13 zeroes
and then bracketed with ones.

113
00:05:40,778 --> 00:05:43,846
Named for the demon Belphegor
who was a prince of hell.

114
00:05:43,848 --> 00:05:46,448
The first clue for the hunt
started making the rounds

115
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,883
a few months ago.

116
00:05:47,885 --> 00:05:49,651
It was a JPEG with two numbers
hidden in it.

117
00:05:49,653 --> 00:05:51,453
You divide those numbers
by Belphegor's Prime,

118
00:05:51,455 --> 00:05:54,890
and you get the GPS coordinates
for a restroom at the Bronx Zoo.

119
00:05:54,892 --> 00:05:56,959
You go to the restroom,
you find a phone number.

120
00:05:56,961 --> 00:05:58,927
You send a text to the number,
you get the next clue.

121
00:05:58,929 --> 00:05:59,962
Which is another math problem.

122
00:05:59,964 --> 00:06:00,929
Exactly.

123
00:06:00,931 --> 00:06:02,397
Only, this one is harder.

124
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,099
And that's how it works.

125
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:05,934
You know, but for
each one that you solve,

126
00:06:05,936 --> 00:06:08,103
you get a new set
of GPS coordinates.

127
00:06:08,105 --> 00:06:11,473
And that means that you've
completed a stage, or a portal.

128
00:06:11,475 --> 00:06:13,509
And last night,
I was on Portal Ten.

129
00:06:13,511 --> 00:06:15,711
And...

130
00:06:17,014 --> 00:06:18,313
You know what?

131
00:06:18,315 --> 00:06:20,015
I want to talk
to Sherlock and Joan.

132
00:06:20,017 --> 00:06:21,917
Look, Mr. Emple...
No, I'm sorry.

133
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,019
I told the police down
at the factory that I know them.

134
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:25,287
Isn't that the whole reason

135
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:26,922
that I was brought here
to this squad?

136
00:06:26,924 --> 00:06:30,392
I-I am not saying another word
until they are here.

137
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:35,264
Harlan Emple is
indeed an acquaintance.

138
00:06:35,266 --> 00:06:37,733
He is, in point of fact,
one of my “irregulars.”

139
00:06:37,735 --> 00:06:38,801
One of your what?

140
00:06:38,803 --> 00:06:40,302
Irregulars.

141
00:06:40,304 --> 00:06:41,770
I'm your consultant, Captain;
they are mine.

142
00:06:41,772 --> 00:06:43,572
They're a handful
of experts I turn to

143
00:06:43,574 --> 00:06:46,108
when I encounter problems which
are beyond my pool of knowledge.

144
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,810
Harlan is
a brilliant mathematician.

145
00:06:47,812 --> 00:06:49,778
And on the handful of occasions
I have tackled a case

146
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,046
which pertained
to mathematics...

147
00:06:51,048 --> 00:06:53,182
He helped you out.
Well, the good news

148
00:06:53,184 --> 00:06:56,018
for him is the preliminary
autopsy report just came in

149
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,252
before you got here.

150
00:06:57,254 --> 00:06:59,021
And the M.E. puts
the time of death

151
00:06:59,023 --> 00:07:00,989
between 4:00 and
6:00 p.m. last night.

152
00:07:00,991 --> 00:07:02,124
Mr. Emple was teaching

153
00:07:02,126 --> 00:07:03,358
a class at Columbia.

154
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,394
So the victim is
yet to be identified?

155
00:07:05,396 --> 00:07:07,663
No I.D., no phone.

156
00:07:07,665 --> 00:07:09,865
First detective on the scene
liked it for a mob hit,

157
00:07:09,867 --> 00:07:11,500
so while we're
running the prints,

158
00:07:11,502 --> 00:07:13,602
he's showing the vic's
face around OCID.

159
00:07:13,604 --> 00:07:16,839
Marcus here was about to walk
the scene with Mr. Emple.

160
00:07:16,841 --> 00:07:18,774
You're here now;
you might as well tag along.

161
00:07:18,776 --> 00:07:21,009
Actually, Captain,
I'm quite busy today.

162
00:07:21,011 --> 00:07:22,978
This is a John Doe,
and we got nothing.

163
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,247
And, like you just said,
you're my consultant.

164
00:07:25,249 --> 00:07:26,748
So, go consult.

165
00:07:29,787 --> 00:07:30,986
Watson.

166
00:07:30,988 --> 00:07:32,588
Um, he's your friend.

167
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,523
Actually, Kitty is
otherwise engaged,

168
00:07:34,525 --> 00:07:37,426
and he did actually help both
of us with a case last year.

169
00:07:37,428 --> 00:07:38,493
Did he not?

170
00:07:40,865 --> 00:07:44,099
Have I told you
how good it is to see you?

171
00:07:44,101 --> 00:07:45,367
Yes, you have.
Three times.

172
00:07:45,369 --> 00:07:46,468
Well, it is.

173
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,636
Hey, lousy circumstances.

174
00:07:47,638 --> 00:07:49,371
But, uh, hey...

175
00:07:49,373 --> 00:07:51,740
I heard from your boss that you
just, uh, got back from London.

176
00:07:51,742 --> 00:07:53,308
Were you working
a case or...?

177
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,576
No, I moved back there.

178
00:07:54,578 --> 00:07:55,677
You mean<i> moved,</i> moved?

179
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:56,845
Is there another
definition?

180
00:07:56,847 --> 00:07:58,513
I was there for
eight months,

181
00:07:58,515 --> 00:08:00,883
and had a change of heart
and returned to New York.

182
00:08:00,885 --> 00:08:02,517
So, you moved to London,
and you didn't, uh...

183
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,086
You know what?
Doesn't even matter.

184
00:08:04,088 --> 00:08:05,387
The point is you're back!

185
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:07,389
Mr. Emple.
Uh, duty calls.

186
00:08:07,391 --> 00:08:09,024
Yeah.

187
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:18,634
It's interesting.

188
00:08:18,636 --> 00:08:20,068
Mothballs are interesting?

189
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,070
They were taken from
that cabinet over there.

190
00:08:22,072 --> 00:08:25,941
Obviously, to cover the smell
of John Doe's decay.

191
00:08:25,943 --> 00:08:28,043
The killer didn't
bring them with him.

192
00:08:28,045 --> 00:08:31,179
Perhaps leaving the body here
was not part of his plan, hmm?

193
00:08:32,983 --> 00:08:36,018
Doe was shot in the foot
first and then the knee.

194
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,453
Either those were
two really bad misses or...

195
00:08:38,455 --> 00:08:41,256
Or the killer was torturing him.

196
00:08:41,258 --> 00:08:43,892
This doesn't seem like anything
you can't handle on your own.

197
00:08:43,894 --> 00:08:45,994
So you want to tell me why you
really asked me to come here?

198
00:08:45,996 --> 00:08:48,363
“This doesn't seem like anything
you can't handle on your own.”

199
00:08:48,365 --> 00:08:49,765
That's funny.

200
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:51,566
That's exactly what
I would have said

201
00:08:51,568 --> 00:08:53,602
had I been present when you
asked Kitty for her assistance

202
00:08:53,604 --> 00:08:54,937
with your tawdry side job.

203
00:08:54,939 --> 00:08:57,372
“Tawdry”?
I wanted you to know I approve.

204
00:08:57,374 --> 00:08:59,007
Of what?

205
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:01,376
Your agenda
with regards to Kitty.

206
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:03,078
Several days ago,
I gave you her file.

207
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,913
And then you show up at
the brownstone yesterday,

208
00:09:04,915 --> 00:09:06,515
and you invite her
into an investigation.

209
00:09:06,517 --> 00:09:08,183
Coincidence? No, I think not.

210
00:09:08,185 --> 00:09:11,320
You feel for her.
And now you wish to engage.

211
00:09:11,322 --> 00:09:13,956
It's not an outcome
I would have predicted, no.

212
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,458
But it is one
I approve of, yeah.

213
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,193
She could learn
a great deal from you,

214
00:09:18,195 --> 00:09:20,228
especially with regards
to how to get the most

215
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,864
from my tutelage.

216
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:25,734
So, I've already dispatched her
to, uh, follow your Mr. Keswick.

217
00:09:25,736 --> 00:09:27,836
But that's not
what I actually...

218
00:09:27,838 --> 00:09:29,404
Harlan!

219
00:09:30,741 --> 00:09:33,075
You came here to retrieve
a phone number, did you not?

220
00:09:33,077 --> 00:09:34,609
You would send a text,
and then receive

221
00:09:34,611 --> 00:09:36,845
the next clue in the game
that you were playing.

222
00:09:36,847 --> 00:09:38,747
Yeah, but I didn't find it.

223
00:09:38,749 --> 00:09:40,048
Not that I kept looking

224
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,250
after the dead guy
fell out of the locker.

225
00:09:42,252 --> 00:09:44,052
Yeah, CSU didn't find
any number either.

226
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:46,154
Probably because
it's under that paint.

227
00:09:46,156 --> 00:09:48,190
It's fresh.

228
00:09:48,192 --> 00:09:49,891
Applied in the last

229
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:52,694
24 hours.

230
00:09:52,696 --> 00:09:54,696
Right after John Doe's murder,
I'd wager.

231
00:09:54,698 --> 00:09:57,099
You don't think
this was a mob hit?

232
00:09:57,101 --> 00:09:59,101
Doe and the killer were
playing the game, too.

233
00:09:59,103 --> 00:10:01,203
The killer shot Doe and
then covered up the number

234
00:10:01,205 --> 00:10:02,704
so no one else could use it.

235
00:10:02,706 --> 00:10:04,806
What's the prize
in your little contest?

236
00:10:04,808 --> 00:10:07,576
Well, I'm doing it
mostly for the math.

237
00:10:07,578 --> 00:10:11,480
But, uh, $1,707,071.

238
00:10:11,482 --> 00:10:13,882
It's another
palindromic prime.

239
00:10:13,884 --> 00:10:17,152
Did I not mention the
money at the station?

240
00:10:17,154 --> 00:10:18,587
Who the hell can afford

241
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:20,655
that kind of payout
for a puzzle hunt?

242
00:10:20,657 --> 00:10:22,124
Well, most people
think it's CAML.

243
00:10:22,126 --> 00:10:24,593
The Center for Applied
Mathematics and Logic.

244
00:10:24,595 --> 00:10:26,094
It's located
in Ramapo...

245
00:10:26,096 --> 00:10:27,729
Wait, most people
“think” it's them?

246
00:10:27,731 --> 00:10:29,331
Well, hunts like these,

247
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,266
the organizers are
almost always anonymous.

248
00:10:31,268 --> 00:10:32,401
It's S.O.P.

249
00:10:32,403 --> 00:10:34,302
What about the
contestants?

250
00:10:34,304 --> 00:10:37,005
Is anonymity
also S.O.P.?

251
00:10:37,007 --> 00:10:39,207
For the most part, yeah.

252
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:43,078
But, guys, math peeps
are my peeps, okay?

253
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,314
It's, uh, like
a community, sort of.

254
00:10:46,316 --> 00:10:48,984
I can think of ten
or 12 other people

255
00:10:48,986 --> 00:10:50,018
who were probably competing.

256
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,186
Would that help?

257
00:10:53,157 --> 00:10:55,223
No.

258
00:10:55,225 --> 00:10:58,026
I'm sorry, I don't know him.

259
00:10:58,028 --> 00:11:00,862
But you admit you were
competing in Belphegor's Prime.

260
00:11:00,864 --> 00:11:02,197
I do.

261
00:11:04,835 --> 00:11:05,934
Pepe!

262
00:11:08,172 --> 00:11:10,439
Sorry. He doesn't
like strangers.

263
00:11:12,109 --> 00:11:14,443
Give him one of these.

264
00:11:14,445 --> 00:11:16,111
Get on his good side.

265
00:11:24,288 --> 00:11:26,354
What are you doing?

266
00:11:28,225 --> 00:11:30,725
I'm just verifying that
you've been lying to us.

267
00:11:30,727 --> 00:11:33,895
You did know the
dead man, did you not?

268
00:11:33,897 --> 00:11:36,998
I reviewed his personal
effects at the morgue earlier.

269
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,034
The coroner reported finding
crumbs in one of his pockets.

270
00:11:39,036 --> 00:11:40,036
I tasted one.

271
00:11:40,037 --> 00:11:41,269
Why would you...?

272
00:11:41,271 --> 00:11:42,771
At first, I thought
they were from

273
00:11:42,773 --> 00:11:44,439
a particularly rancid
brand of cheese,

274
00:11:44,441 --> 00:11:47,609
but, no... they're from
one of Pepe's treats.

275
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:49,277
Homemade?

276
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,481
Harlan was able to give us
the names of nine other people

277
00:11:52,483 --> 00:11:54,149
he believed to be
other competitors.

278
00:11:54,151 --> 00:11:55,984
Our colleagues are
investigating them as we speak,

279
00:11:55,986 --> 00:11:57,919
but I'll quite happily
recommend that the NYPD

280
00:11:57,921 --> 00:12:00,222
focus its attention
entirely on you.

281
00:12:04,128 --> 00:12:06,428
His name was Ike Walaczek.

282
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,231
In another lifetime,
he was my boyfriend.

283
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:10,866
And what of
this lifetime?

284
00:12:10,868 --> 00:12:12,701
We were working together.

285
00:12:12,703 --> 00:12:14,769
On Belphegor's.
What?!

286
00:12:14,771 --> 00:12:16,705
He was a numerical analyst
at the Tory Foundation.

287
00:12:16,707 --> 00:12:17,873
I work mostly in combinatorics.

288
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,307
I thought we would make
a good team.

289
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:20,742
But there aren't
supposed to be teams.

290
00:12:20,744 --> 00:12:22,711
Not in a puzzle hunt.
It's bad form.

291
00:12:22,713 --> 00:12:23,713
Harlan...

292
00:12:23,714 --> 00:12:25,514
I'm just saying...

293
00:12:25,516 --> 00:12:27,315
My husband
wouldn't understand,

294
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:30,385
so I decided I wouldn't tell him
until after we won the money.

295
00:12:30,387 --> 00:12:33,121
A team-- so that's how
you got there before me.

296
00:12:33,123 --> 00:12:34,489
I wasn't there.

297
00:12:34,491 --> 00:12:36,258
Tom and I were out of town
until this morning.

298
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,126
His cousin
was getting married in Hawaii.

299
00:12:38,128 --> 00:12:40,662
That's why Ike went
to the coordinates by himself.

300
00:12:40,664 --> 00:12:42,097
Because I couldn't.

301
00:12:44,268 --> 00:12:46,601
These are pictures I took.

302
00:12:46,603 --> 00:12:49,337
Check the dates.

303
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:51,506
You gave the police
nine other names?

304
00:12:51,508 --> 00:12:53,408
People you thought
were competing?

305
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,776
I've got 16.

306
00:12:54,778 --> 00:12:56,311
And I know they were competing.

307
00:12:58,448 --> 00:13:01,249
He talked to her
outside the Jamaica property

308
00:13:01,251 --> 00:13:05,720
for about 20 minutes,
and then this truck rolled up.

309
00:13:05,722 --> 00:13:07,822
Any idea what's
inside the crate?

310
00:13:07,824 --> 00:13:09,024
Nope.

311
00:13:09,026 --> 00:13:10,392
I can't identify
the woman either.

312
00:13:10,394 --> 00:13:12,260
Everything about her
said money though.

313
00:13:12,262 --> 00:13:15,363
She, Keswick
and the mystery box

314
00:13:15,365 --> 00:13:17,732
stayed inside the building
for about three hours,

315
00:13:17,734 --> 00:13:20,001
and then off they went.

316
00:13:20,904 --> 00:13:22,170
Good.

317
00:13:22,172 --> 00:13:23,872
Okay.

318
00:13:23,874 --> 00:13:26,074
You know where
to send the check.

319
00:13:26,076 --> 00:13:30,145
You haven't asked me about
the file Sherlock gave me.

320
00:13:30,147 --> 00:13:32,080
Why would I?

321
00:13:32,082 --> 00:13:36,184
You said it would give me
a better sense of you-- it did.

322
00:13:37,588 --> 00:13:40,155
That's why you asked
for my help.

323
00:13:40,157 --> 00:13:41,990
Because you felt sorry for me.

324
00:13:41,992 --> 00:13:44,226
No.

325
00:13:44,228 --> 00:13:46,194
You just don't seem interested
in anything

326
00:13:46,196 --> 00:13:48,063
outside of becoming
a detective.

327
00:13:48,065 --> 00:13:50,999
There she is.

328
00:13:51,001 --> 00:13:53,301
The old counselor.

329
00:13:53,303 --> 00:13:55,637
Who used to hold
Sherlock's hand.

330
00:13:57,608 --> 00:13:59,741
Everything that you read,

331
00:13:59,743 --> 00:14:02,510
everything that happened to me,
that's all it is.

332
00:14:02,512 --> 00:14:04,646
It's just something
that happened.

333
00:14:04,648 --> 00:14:08,116
And it's all
in the past now.

334
00:14:08,118 --> 00:14:10,685
So let's just
leave it there, shall we?

335
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:24,667
Hello.

336
00:14:24,668 --> 00:14:26,001
You've had sex.

337
00:14:26,003 --> 00:14:27,202
Excuse me?

338
00:14:27,204 --> 00:14:28,503
I can hear it
in your voice.

339
00:14:28,505 --> 00:14:29,771
You've joined paunches.

340
00:14:29,773 --> 00:14:30,972
Good for you, Watson.

341
00:14:30,974 --> 00:14:32,807
As you know, I think
the act of love

342
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:34,676
can be quite conducive to...
What do you want?

343
00:14:34,678 --> 00:14:36,911
Merely to apprise you
of a new development

344
00:14:36,913 --> 00:14:38,280
in the murder of
Ike Walaczek.

345
00:14:38,282 --> 00:14:40,115
As I informed
you yesterday,

346
00:14:40,117 --> 00:14:42,284
Harlan and I were given
a new list of competitors.

347
00:14:42,286 --> 00:14:45,320
One name leapt out:
Byron Lowenthal.

348
00:14:45,322 --> 00:14:48,156
He's a statistician at the
Public Utilities Commission

349
00:14:48,158 --> 00:14:50,425
and a diagnosed
paranoid schizophrenic.

350
00:14:50,427 --> 00:14:52,160
He's been hospitalized
for becoming violent

351
00:14:52,162 --> 00:14:53,728
on no fewer
than three occasions.

352
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,964
Certainly sounds like
it could be our guy.

353
00:14:55,966 --> 00:14:59,367
Unfortunately, Mr. Lowenthal had
another break earlier this year.

354
00:14:59,369 --> 00:15:02,137
He's been staying in
a transient hotel ever since.

355
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:04,239
Detective Bell and I
are going to speak with him.

356
00:15:04,241 --> 00:15:05,307
You want me to meet you?

357
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:06,875
Oh, no, we're already here.

358
00:15:06,877 --> 00:15:08,410
Anyway, now that I know
that you've enjoyed coitus

359
00:15:08,412 --> 00:15:09,778
and could enjoy more
in the near future...

360
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,846
When you're done,
we need to talk.

361
00:15:14,718 --> 00:15:16,818
Byron Lowenthal,
you in there?

362
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,053
Who is it?

363
00:15:18,055 --> 00:15:19,754
It's Detective Bell, NYPD.

364
00:15:19,756 --> 00:15:22,257
My colleague and I would like
to ask you some questions.

365
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:24,592
Let me
get some pants on.

366
00:15:37,341 --> 00:15:40,008
S-Sorry, I just... I, um...

367
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,310
I-I thought I heard
Mr. Lowenthal retr...

368
00:16:19,154 --> 00:16:21,267
You guys got lucky.

369
00:16:21,268 --> 00:16:22,868
Well, luck had little
to do with it, actually.

370
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,536
I... I heard Mr. Lowenthal

371
00:16:24,538 --> 00:16:27,039
pulling a heavy object off
a shelf, placing it on his bed,

372
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,041
and the sound of
the zipper indicated

373
00:16:29,043 --> 00:16:30,976
that it was
a large gun case.

374
00:16:30,978 --> 00:16:33,579
Looks like he was sane enough
to do math, but not much else.

375
00:16:33,581 --> 00:16:34,747
Plus, he was
pretty hopped up.

376
00:16:34,749 --> 00:16:36,448
Caffeine pills,
energy drinks,

377
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,251
pretty much every legal
stimulant you can buy.

378
00:16:39,253 --> 00:16:40,853
Plus a few illegal ones.

379
00:16:40,855 --> 00:16:42,821
Hmm. Obviously, he was
keeping himself awake

380
00:16:42,823 --> 00:16:44,490
so he could work on
Belphegor's.

381
00:16:44,492 --> 00:16:47,392
This... is obvious to you?

382
00:16:47,394 --> 00:16:48,961
I confess the maths
are beyond me,

383
00:16:48,963 --> 00:16:51,130
but I took the liberty of
sending pictures of what

384
00:16:51,132 --> 00:16:52,865
appear to be Mr. Lowenthal's
most recent scribbles

385
00:16:52,867 --> 00:16:54,166
to Harlan Emple,
and he's confirmed

386
00:16:54,168 --> 00:16:55,667
they are part of the contest.

387
00:16:55,669 --> 00:16:56,969
With your permission,
I'd like copies of these

388
00:16:56,971 --> 00:16:58,837
sent to my home
so he can review them.

389
00:16:58,839 --> 00:16:59,972
What for?

390
00:16:59,974 --> 00:17:01,073
If Byron Lowenthal

391
00:17:01,075 --> 00:17:02,441
did kill Ike Walaczek,

392
00:17:02,443 --> 00:17:04,109
then he used
and obscured a phone number,

393
00:17:04,111 --> 00:17:05,878
which would have yielded
the next problem.

394
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,379
That problem's solution

395
00:17:07,381 --> 00:17:08,714
would be GPS coordinates.

396
00:17:08,716 --> 00:17:10,415
If he's recorded them
in his books...

397
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:12,551
Your pal will be able to tell us
where he's headed next.

398
00:17:12,553 --> 00:17:14,853
I'll get our guys to give you

399
00:17:14,855 --> 00:17:16,388
whatever you need.

400
00:17:17,258 --> 00:17:18,991
Scans are still coming through,

401
00:17:18,993 --> 00:17:21,260
but I've put what we've got
so far up on the wall.

402
00:17:21,262 --> 00:17:23,262
Sherlock said that
you prefer it that way.

403
00:17:23,264 --> 00:17:25,030
Picked it up from him,
actually.

404
00:17:25,032 --> 00:17:28,600
Makes me feel like I'm really
inside of the problem.

405
00:17:30,704 --> 00:17:33,372
I'll, uh, let you know
if I need anything.

406
00:17:34,275 --> 00:17:35,974
Oh, I work without a shirt.

407
00:17:35,976 --> 00:17:38,911
Sometimes makes me feel
closer to the numbers.

408
00:17:38,913 --> 00:17:42,147
You'll need to, uh,
check the printer in the study

409
00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:43,615
for more pages.

410
00:17:43,617 --> 00:17:45,417
Uh, this is nice,
you know?

411
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:47,452
Meeting another member
of the team.

412
00:17:47,454 --> 00:17:48,654
You know, Team Sherlock.

413
00:17:48,656 --> 00:17:50,656
You help him, I help him...

414
00:17:51,926 --> 00:17:53,559
Obviously, you haven't
tackled a case

415
00:17:53,561 --> 00:17:55,093
with high-order math since
you started working with him,

416
00:17:55,095 --> 00:17:57,729
or we would've...

417
00:17:57,731 --> 00:17:59,031
What?

418
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:00,232
What?

419
00:18:00,234 --> 00:18:01,834
Wait...

420
00:18:01,836 --> 00:18:04,002
have you worked a case
with high-order math?

421
00:18:04,805 --> 00:18:06,238
You have, haven't you?

422
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,840
Does it matter?

423
00:18:07,842 --> 00:18:09,842
Of course it...

424
00:18:09,844 --> 00:18:11,443
Oh, my God.

425
00:18:11,445 --> 00:18:13,278
Did he fire me?

426
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,980
All I know
is that back in London,

427
00:18:14,982 --> 00:18:16,982
we worked a case that involved
Fibonacci spirals...

428
00:18:16,984 --> 00:18:18,483
He fired me.

429
00:18:18,485 --> 00:18:21,386
...and he called some woman
named Indira Patel.

430
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,856
She's at Berkeley.

431
00:18:23,858 --> 00:18:25,624
I'm three time zones closer!

432
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:27,125
You're here now.

433
00:18:27,127 --> 00:18:29,428
Sure, because I found
a dead body.

434
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,531
I have to go; I have to run
some errands for Sherlock.

435
00:18:35,936 --> 00:18:37,903
I-I don't know
what was in the crate,

436
00:18:37,905 --> 00:18:39,271
but the stenciling on
the side indicates

437
00:18:39,273 --> 00:18:40,772
it came from one of
the SUNY schools.

438
00:18:40,774 --> 00:18:42,908
I put another detective
on Keswick...

439
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:45,177
Don't kill me, I had to
use your razor to shave.

440
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:47,179
I...

441
00:18:47,181 --> 00:18:49,147
You must be Andrew.

442
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:50,515
Sherlock Holmes.

443
00:18:50,517 --> 00:18:52,551
Sorry.

444
00:18:52,553 --> 00:18:55,487
Joan said you were coming;
I... I forgot.

445
00:18:55,489 --> 00:18:57,122
It's not how
I wanted to meet you.

446
00:18:57,124 --> 00:18:58,891
She said you can tell
a lot about people

447
00:18:58,893 --> 00:19:00,192
just by looking at them.

448
00:19:00,194 --> 00:19:02,261
I swear, I...
usually wear pants.

449
00:19:02,263 --> 00:19:03,729
Well, in my experience,
most people

450
00:19:03,731 --> 00:19:05,264
need only be concerned
I won't notice

451
00:19:05,266 --> 00:19:06,498
anything worth remarking upon.

452
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:10,535
Watson seems adequately sexed.

453
00:19:11,939 --> 00:19:13,672
Hey.

454
00:19:13,674 --> 00:19:15,674
I was just introducing myself.

455
00:19:17,945 --> 00:19:20,379
I've got that thing.
I'll see you tonight.

456
00:19:20,381 --> 00:19:21,580
Okay.

457
00:19:27,855 --> 00:19:30,188
Your home, Watson...

458
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,823
it's utterly pleasant.

459
00:19:31,825 --> 00:19:33,692
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

460
00:19:33,694 --> 00:19:35,394
When you told me
you wanted a life of your own,

461
00:19:35,396 --> 00:19:36,595
I didn't realize
that you meant you wanted

462
00:19:36,597 --> 00:19:38,030
the same life everyone else has.

463
00:19:38,032 --> 00:19:39,464
But at any rate,
none of my business, is it?

464
00:19:39,466 --> 00:19:41,233
It's not.
And I didn't ask you here

465
00:19:41,235 --> 00:19:42,634
to talk about my apartment.

466
00:19:42,636 --> 00:19:44,970
No, you asked me here
to discuss Kitty.

467
00:19:44,972 --> 00:19:46,471
If she were not
the topic of conversation,

468
00:19:46,473 --> 00:19:48,941
then you wouldn't have
invited me to your home,

469
00:19:48,943 --> 00:19:50,776
where there's no chance
she'll be present.

470
00:19:52,346 --> 00:19:53,946
She disappointed you
in some way.

471
00:19:53,948 --> 00:19:55,247
Skills not up to snuff?

472
00:19:55,249 --> 00:19:57,316
Please remember
she is a novice.

473
00:19:57,318 --> 00:19:58,850
Actually, she did a great job.

474
00:19:58,852 --> 00:20:00,285
But I have some concerns.

475
00:20:00,287 --> 00:20:01,954
I thought we could
talk about them.

476
00:20:03,757 --> 00:20:04,923
You think that
Kitty needs help

477
00:20:04,925 --> 00:20:06,091
above and beyond
my mentorship.

478
00:20:06,093 --> 00:20:07,392
You read the same
file I did.

479
00:20:07,394 --> 00:20:08,894
She's a rape victim.

480
00:20:08,896 --> 00:20:11,296
She was kept and tortured.

481
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,899
Mm.

482
00:20:16,136 --> 00:20:19,171
You know me, so surely you know

483
00:20:19,173 --> 00:20:22,874
I've broached the subject of
a support group meeting before.

484
00:20:22,876 --> 00:20:25,010
Even offered
to pay for therapy.

485
00:20:25,012 --> 00:20:26,812
She's not interested, I know.

486
00:20:26,814 --> 00:20:28,447
Just as you also know

487
00:20:28,449 --> 00:20:30,749
someone with a problem
can't be forced to get help.

488
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:32,551
They have to want it.

489
00:20:32,553 --> 00:20:34,786
What Kitty wants
is to be a detective.

490
00:20:36,523 --> 00:20:38,490
I am taking pains
to try and channel

491
00:20:38,492 --> 00:20:40,592
her residual feelings
into her work.

492
00:20:42,329 --> 00:20:44,463
Well, that works out
great for you.

493
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:48,400
You told me that
you took on a partner

494
00:20:48,402 --> 00:20:50,635
because you wanted to replicate
what you and I had.

495
00:20:50,637 --> 00:20:52,637
That you thought it helped
with your recovery.

496
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:54,539
You think I would
try and take advantage

497
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,208
of the victim of a trauma?

498
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,910
Of course not, but there is
a conflict of interest here.

499
00:20:58,912 --> 00:21:02,447
She needs what she needs,
but you need what you need, too.

500
00:21:06,053 --> 00:21:10,055
It's-it's good that you're
in her life now, Watson.

501
00:21:10,057 --> 00:21:12,524
I mean,
it's commonly believed that, um,

502
00:21:12,526 --> 00:21:16,228
a child benefits mostly from
the presence of two parents.

503
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,164
He-- or she, in this case--
can absorb certain qualities

504
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,466
from the father--
clear-eyed view of the world,

505
00:21:21,468 --> 00:21:23,168
capacity of
rational thought, etcetera.

506
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,170
They can also absorb certain
qualities from the mother.

507
00:21:25,172 --> 00:21:27,105
Excuse me, but I am not
Kitty's mother,

508
00:21:27,107 --> 00:21:28,807
and she sure as hell
is not our child.

509
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:30,942
You brought her here;
she looks up to you.

510
00:21:30,944 --> 00:21:32,944
She says that she doesn't
need help-- fine--

511
00:21:32,946 --> 00:21:34,579
but you know better.

512
00:21:34,581 --> 00:21:37,082
And you're gonna have to be
the one that tells her.

513
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,620
It's Harlan.

514
00:21:41,622 --> 00:21:44,523
Making progress with the maths.

515
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,660
We thought
that Byron and Ike

516
00:21:48,662 --> 00:21:50,462
arrived at Portal Ten
simultaneously.

517
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,664
That would've meant that they
were doing all the same math

518
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,032
at essentially
the same time.

519
00:21:54,034 --> 00:21:56,001
Only, the math
you found at Byron's place

520
00:21:56,003 --> 00:21:57,003
says that's wrong.

521
00:21:57,004 --> 00:21:58,470
He was one step behind Ike.

522
00:21:58,472 --> 00:22:00,705
Are you proposing he did
not kill Mr. Walaczek?

523
00:22:00,707 --> 00:22:03,175
I don't know, but that's
not the weirdest part.

524
00:22:03,177 --> 00:22:04,810
Byron was obsessive.

525
00:22:04,812 --> 00:22:06,211
He time-stamped
almost everything he did.

526
00:22:06,213 --> 00:22:09,047
He only solved
the Portal Nine problem,

527
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:11,316
the same problem that sent me
to that old factory last night.

528
00:22:11,318 --> 00:22:12,884
But get this--

529
00:22:12,886 --> 00:22:14,686
he wasn't given
the same problem as me.

530
00:22:14,688 --> 00:22:16,655
And so it would've yielded
GPS coordinates

531
00:22:16,657 --> 00:22:18,323
for an entirely
different location.

532
00:22:18,325 --> 00:22:21,760
The person in charge of
the game changed the clue

533
00:22:21,762 --> 00:22:23,328
after the police
found Ike's body.

534
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:25,964
Well, he had to, right?

535
00:22:25,966 --> 00:22:27,899
If he hadn't, he would be
sending other competitors

536
00:22:27,901 --> 00:22:29,101
to an active crime scene.

537
00:22:29,103 --> 00:22:30,402
The important thing is

538
00:22:30,404 --> 00:22:31,536
I figured out the coordinates

539
00:22:31,538 --> 00:22:32,771
to the second location.

540
00:22:32,773 --> 00:22:35,540
I know where Byron went.

541
00:22:35,542 --> 00:22:36,842
What are you doing?

542
00:22:36,844 --> 00:22:38,410
You're saying he
time-stamped everything.

543
00:22:38,412 --> 00:22:40,345
I'm looking at the time
he received his clues.

544
00:22:40,347 --> 00:22:42,647
It's all there, to the second,
but what does that have to do...

545
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:44,149
What if you hadn't
found a body?

546
00:22:44,151 --> 00:22:46,118
If the game had
proceeded as planned,

547
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,486
what were you meant
to do there?

548
00:22:47,488 --> 00:22:49,354
I would have sent a text
to the phone number,

549
00:22:49,356 --> 00:22:51,523
the one that the killer painted
over, and then I would have

550
00:22:51,525 --> 00:22:52,891
gotten a message back
with the next problem.

551
00:22:52,893 --> 00:22:54,559
There's an extra
step in there.

552
00:22:54,561 --> 00:22:56,428
Why all this rigmarole with
phone numbers and texts?

553
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,064
Why not just post the problem
itself at the factory?

554
00:22:59,066 --> 00:23:02,100
I don't know, it's just the way
the game is played.

555
00:23:02,102 --> 00:23:04,102
They're for an old
industrial area in Queens.

556
00:23:04,104 --> 00:23:06,805
You're welcome
for finding your suspect.

557
00:23:06,807 --> 00:23:09,207
If I'm right, Harlan,
what you've found...

558
00:23:09,209 --> 00:23:11,109
is the site of
another murder.

559
00:23:11,111 --> 00:23:13,245
Byron Lowenthal's.

560
00:23:15,983 --> 00:23:18,216
You were right,
Lowenthal's dead.

561
00:23:18,218 --> 00:23:20,952
He was shot in the foot,
then the knee.

562
00:23:20,954 --> 00:23:22,821
Just like
Ike Wallaczek.

563
00:23:22,823 --> 00:23:26,391
I'm, uh, gonna look
over here now.

564
00:23:26,393 --> 00:23:29,427
Well, we think the perp
was pulling the body

565
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:31,429
to a car that was parked
over there.

566
00:23:31,431 --> 00:23:34,065
Then he just
left him here.

567
00:23:34,067 --> 00:23:35,901
Probably afraid
he'd been spotted.

568
00:23:35,903 --> 00:23:38,803
There's a lot
of homeless in the area.

569
00:23:41,441 --> 00:23:43,008
Question is:

570
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:45,010
how'd you know
Lowenthal was the next victim

571
00:23:45,012 --> 00:23:46,511
and not the killer?

572
00:23:49,316 --> 00:23:51,750
Well, that's
quite simple, really.

573
00:23:51,752 --> 00:23:54,352
The game is directing
its players to remote locales,

574
00:23:54,354 --> 00:23:56,788
and then instructing them
to send a text message

575
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,256
indicating their presence.

576
00:23:58,258 --> 00:24:00,125
I suspect the killer wanted
to remove the body

577
00:24:00,127 --> 00:24:02,928
so he could keep this new
location “in play,” so to speak.

578
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:05,130
Still missing the “simple” part.

579
00:24:05,132 --> 00:24:06,698
The late Mr. Lowenthal

580
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,366
received his final clue

581
00:24:08,368 --> 00:24:10,235
after Harlan discovered
Ike Wallaczek's body,

582
00:24:10,237 --> 00:24:12,737
but before news of the killing
had reached the media.

583
00:24:12,739 --> 00:24:14,439
That means the
game's designer

584
00:24:14,441 --> 00:24:16,408
knew the location
had been compromised.

585
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,577
And the only way
that he could have known that,

586
00:24:18,579 --> 00:24:20,111
at the time that he knew it,

587
00:24:20,113 --> 00:24:21,880
was if he, himself,
was the killer.

588
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,917
Belphegor's Prime is not
a treasure hunt.

589
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,619
It's a trap.

590
00:24:40,696 --> 00:24:42,196
Better?

591
00:24:42,198 --> 00:24:44,665
False alarm.

592
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:47,668
But I still feel
a little queasy.

593
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,273
This new dead guy--

594
00:24:52,275 --> 00:24:54,875
your friend said that he was
tortured, too, right?

595
00:24:54,877 --> 00:24:57,244
Right before the killer tried
to abscond with his corpse.

596
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:59,213
I assume
he intended to take

597
00:24:59,215 --> 00:25:02,383
Ike Wallaczek away with him
as well, only Ike was too large.

598
00:25:02,385 --> 00:25:04,685
A speedy mothballing
was the best he could do.

599
00:25:04,687 --> 00:25:07,221
So, just to recap,

600
00:25:07,223 --> 00:25:09,657
I've spent the last
few months of my life

601
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:13,360
playing a game that was
designed to kill me.

602
00:25:13,362 --> 00:25:15,629
Got to be a metaphor
in there somewhere, right?

603
00:25:15,631 --> 00:25:18,966
I think the word you're
looking for is “moral.”

604
00:25:18,968 --> 00:25:21,902
There is a moral in there:
games are for idiots.

605
00:25:24,707 --> 00:25:26,473
Breaking news from Ramapo.

606
00:25:26,475 --> 00:25:29,443
Kitty reports the Center for
Applied Mathematics and Logic

607
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,912
is not the sponsor
of Belphegor's Prime.

608
00:25:31,914 --> 00:25:34,148
Then it's got to be
a serial killer, right?

609
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,716
Someone who's obsessed
with mathematicians?

610
00:25:35,718 --> 00:25:37,284
Mm.

611
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,920
Perhaps he was bullied
by mathematicians as a child.

612
00:25:39,922 --> 00:25:42,056
Or mathematicians
killed his parents.

613
00:25:42,058 --> 00:25:43,657
I'm being serious.

614
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:45,726
Serial killers who devise
elaborate death traps

615
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,461
are the stuff of pulp fiction.

616
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:49,229
And besides, with respect
to these murders,

617
00:25:49,231 --> 00:25:51,165
there are none
of the elaborations

618
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:53,767
which mark that sort of culprit.

619
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:55,970
If anything, I would describe
the work as businesslike.

620
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:58,172
Then it's the government.

621
00:25:58,174 --> 00:26:01,241
I mean, the-the game was some
sort of test to weed out people

622
00:26:01,243 --> 00:26:03,243
who could weaponize math.

623
00:26:03,245 --> 00:26:05,179
The American intelligence
apparatus may be clod-like,

624
00:26:05,181 --> 00:26:07,014
but I think they would
do a better job

625
00:26:07,016 --> 00:26:08,749
of disposing of two bodies,
don't you?

626
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:11,785
Watson?

627
00:26:11,787 --> 00:26:13,621
I just heard
from one of the suspects

628
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:14,922
Marcus and I talked to
yesterday,

629
00:26:14,924 --> 00:26:16,290
another puzzle-hunter.

630
00:26:16,292 --> 00:26:18,525
Tell me he confessed
to the murders.

631
00:26:18,527 --> 00:26:20,427
We ruled him out right away,
but he heard about

632
00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:22,329
Byron Lowenthal's murder on
the news and wanted me to know

633
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:25,165
he's at a friend's place,
some guy named Paul.

634
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,934
That is fascinating.

635
00:26:26,936 --> 00:26:28,369
Actually, it might be.

636
00:26:28,371 --> 00:26:31,038
Paul is positive he knows
who the killer is.

637
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,807
I know the guards
are a bit much,

638
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:35,509
but I wanted everyone
to feel safe.

639
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:38,178
And, besides,
math has been good to me.

640
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,279
Commodities.

641
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:40,848
So, you and your friends,

642
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:43,150
you were competitors
in Belphegor's Prime?

643
00:26:43,152 --> 00:26:45,352
Most of us. Some of the others
are just here for the math.

644
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,121
You said you could
identify the killer.

645
00:26:47,123 --> 00:26:49,323
I can, sort of.

646
00:26:52,061 --> 00:26:54,194
“Mo Shellshocker.”

647
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:56,930
It's a pseudonym,
obviously, but I'm telling you,

648
00:26:56,932 --> 00:26:58,365
this is the guy
you're looking for.

649
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,600
I've heard of him.

650
00:26:59,602 --> 00:27:01,335
He uses his blog
to expose bad math.

651
00:27:01,337 --> 00:27:03,837
Corrupt economists, biased
pollsters, that sort of thing.

652
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:05,572
He's actually
sort of a crusader.

653
00:27:05,574 --> 00:27:06,574
He's a murderer.

654
00:27:06,575 --> 00:27:09,143
How can you be
so sure?

655
00:27:09,145 --> 00:27:10,744
When he isn't crusading,
he's competing in puzzle hunts.

656
00:27:10,746 --> 00:27:11,812
A few months ago,

657
00:27:11,814 --> 00:27:13,080
he claimed to
have solved

658
00:27:13,082 --> 00:27:14,815
Cicada 3301 two
years in a row.

659
00:27:14,817 --> 00:27:17,484
Some people called BS,
including...

660
00:27:17,486 --> 00:27:20,120
Ike Wallaczek
and Byron Lowenthal.

661
00:27:20,122 --> 00:27:21,221
“WallaCheckYourMath,”

662
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:22,489
“ByLow2020.”

663
00:27:22,491 --> 00:27:23,757
Those are their
online handles.

664
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:25,392
Their friends
will confirm it.

665
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,528
A flame war does not
a murderer make.

666
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:30,097
The stuff these guys were
slinging at each other was ugly.

667
00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:32,099
Mo knew they were into hunts,
and so he built one

668
00:27:32,101 --> 00:27:34,034
that would send them to places
where he could kill them.

669
00:27:34,036 --> 00:27:35,469
That's what we're
doing here is

670
00:27:35,471 --> 00:27:36,837
we're just sifting
through all the math

671
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:38,338
he's posted on his blog
over the years,

672
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,840
to see if we could
find his signature

673
00:27:39,842 --> 00:27:41,975
or something that
could identify him.

674
00:27:41,977 --> 00:27:45,279
If two people weren't dead,
we'd probably be having fun.

675
00:27:45,281 --> 00:27:46,747
But still, the
chances that he left

676
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:48,582
something like that
in his math...

677
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,784
If it's there, we'll find it.
In the meantime,

678
00:27:50,786 --> 00:27:52,186
we thought the
police should know

679
00:27:52,188 --> 00:27:53,687
who they're really
dealing with.

680
00:27:53,689 --> 00:27:55,389
<i>I've got to go meet someone</i>

681
00:27:55,391 --> 00:27:56,924
about my other case.

682
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:59,927
You're good to pass all this
along to Marcus? Okay.

683
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:03,030
I must say, I'm surprised you
didn't offer to stay and help.

684
00:28:03,032 --> 00:28:05,265
Mr. Ettinger makes
a compelling case with respect

685
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,067
to Mo Shellshocker's
viability as a suspect.

686
00:28:07,069 --> 00:28:09,002
Mo is a genius.

687
00:28:09,004 --> 00:28:10,637
We're talking off the charts.

688
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:12,139
Leibniz meets Euler meets Gauss.

689
00:28:12,141 --> 00:28:14,108
Huh.
He may have an ego,

690
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,110
but he's not gonna kill
anyone over a few comments.

691
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:18,312
So, while “The League of
Concerned Mathematician”"

692
00:28:18,314 --> 00:28:21,014
chases its tail up there, I
am gonna do the smart thing

693
00:28:21,016 --> 00:28:22,416
and get out of town.

694
00:28:22,418 --> 00:28:24,485
You can let me know
when it all blows over.

695
00:28:24,487 --> 00:28:26,386
You're not going
anywhere, Harlan.

696
00:28:26,388 --> 00:28:29,223
Or should I call you
Mo Shellshocker?

697
00:28:32,728 --> 00:28:34,661
Did you honestly think
I wouldn't recognize

698
00:28:34,663 --> 00:28:36,130
an anagram of my own name?

699
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:40,567
I knew I should've gone
with “Choker Hell Moss”"

700
00:28:40,569 --> 00:28:42,569
But I never thought
that you would see it, okay?

701
00:28:42,571 --> 00:28:44,104
Math is my thing, not yours.

702
00:28:44,106 --> 00:28:46,473
It's my name, Harlan;
that makes it my thing.

703
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,675
It was an homage.

704
00:28:48,677 --> 00:28:50,043
Explain.

705
00:28:50,045 --> 00:28:52,045
Every day, all over the world,

706
00:28:52,047 --> 00:28:54,348
math is used to trick people.

707
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,917
Data dredging to sell
pharmaceuticals.

708
00:28:56,919 --> 00:28:59,720
Publication bias
to justify wars.

709
00:28:59,722 --> 00:29:02,322
In the wrong hands, math can be
manipulated, abused.

710
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:05,425
And I decided to do
something about it.

711
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:09,596
You catch people
who murder other people.

712
00:29:09,598 --> 00:29:11,431
I catch people who murder math.

713
00:29:11,433 --> 00:29:14,568
According to this,
Mo is a wanted man.

714
00:29:17,606 --> 00:29:19,940
Harlan?

715
00:29:19,942 --> 00:29:23,110
The D.O.D. was working
on a new fighter.

716
00:29:23,112 --> 00:29:27,047
Only, I knew that the
performance stats were bogus.

717
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:29,116
A friend of mine found
the internal numbers,

718
00:29:29,118 --> 00:29:31,251
and I sort of published them.

719
00:29:31,253 --> 00:29:33,320
So you put classified
Department of Defense documents

720
00:29:33,322 --> 00:29:34,888
on the Internet.

721
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:36,623
Isn't that what
you would have done?

722
00:29:38,928 --> 00:29:41,562
Fine! I screwed up, okay?

723
00:29:41,564 --> 00:29:43,730
But, hey, that's what I do,
right? I screw up.

724
00:29:43,732 --> 00:29:46,233
If I didn't, then probably you
wouldn't have secretly fired me.

725
00:29:46,235 --> 00:29:47,968
Excuse me?

726
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,403
I know about Indira Patel!

727
00:29:51,006 --> 00:29:53,340
I know you replaced me.

728
00:29:55,144 --> 00:29:58,979
Kitty, I think
we could use some tea.

729
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:04,318
Just tell me.

730
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,253
Tell me what math I got wrong.

731
00:30:06,255 --> 00:30:09,356
Tell me why you didn't let me
make it up to you.

732
00:30:09,358 --> 00:30:12,926
It wasn't the maths, it was you.

733
00:30:14,763 --> 00:30:18,232
Your work was impeccable.

734
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:20,334
And for the most part,
I enjoyed our collaborations.

735
00:30:20,336 --> 00:30:24,838
B-But over time, you just...
you became quite... needy.

736
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,406
What are you talking about?

737
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:29,109
Y-You asked my advice
on-on social matters,

738
00:30:29,111 --> 00:30:32,512
and you even invited me
to a party.

739
00:30:32,514 --> 00:30:34,648
You were my friend.

740
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,416
I was your employer, Harlan.

741
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:37,918
A-And you were my consultant.

742
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,419
One of many.

743
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:43,757
I know that I'm a little
obsessed with what I do.

744
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:46,960
That has always made it hard
to make friends.

745
00:30:46,962 --> 00:30:50,664
And I used to feel pretty bad
about that, and then I met you.

746
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:52,566
And I thought to myself,

747
00:30:52,568 --> 00:30:55,903
hey, if it doesn't bother him,
why should I let it bother me?

748
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:03,810
I got a lot
out of the work that we did.

749
00:31:03,812 --> 00:31:06,146
A lot.

750
00:31:06,148 --> 00:31:11,218
But if someone like you thinks
that I'm a loser, then...

751
00:31:22,564 --> 00:31:24,965
Hey, are we still doing this?

752
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:26,366
Doing what?

753
00:31:26,368 --> 00:31:28,502
Talking about the case.

754
00:31:28,504 --> 00:31:30,070
You're just sitting there.

755
00:31:30,072 --> 00:31:32,105
I'm thinking.

756
00:31:32,107 --> 00:31:34,308
I suspect the silence
is exacerbated

757
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,143
by the nature
of our communication.

758
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:37,811
Yes. Well, I don't
live there anymore.

759
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,713
So, if you want
to talk shop at night,

760
00:31:39,715 --> 00:31:41,515
this is the best I can do.

761
00:31:41,517 --> 00:31:45,252
Keep asking myself:
what did the killer want?

762
00:31:45,254 --> 00:31:48,255
He went to great lengths to lure
brilliant mathematicians

763
00:31:48,257 --> 00:31:49,489
to their deaths.

764
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,525
Winnowed out
the less gifted

765
00:31:51,527 --> 00:31:54,061
by making his problems
more and more complicated.

766
00:31:54,063 --> 00:31:57,597
He had a type, but I still think
he's a serial killer

767
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:59,266
only in the most
technical sense.

768
00:31:59,268 --> 00:32:01,201
He tortured both his victims.

769
00:32:01,203 --> 00:32:02,936
But there's no sign
that he enjoyed it.

770
00:32:02,938 --> 00:32:04,538
The work was
utilitarian,

771
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,740
suggesting it was
less for pleasure

772
00:32:06,742 --> 00:32:10,043
and more for persuasion.

773
00:32:10,045 --> 00:32:11,945
He wanted something.

774
00:32:11,947 --> 00:32:13,714
But what?

775
00:32:13,716 --> 00:32:16,483
Maybe there's a connection
between Wallaczek and Lowenthal

776
00:32:16,485 --> 00:32:18,418
we haven't spotted yet.

777
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,220
Maybe they were working
on a project together,

778
00:32:20,222 --> 00:32:21,822
something that was worth
a lot of money.

779
00:32:21,824 --> 00:32:23,857
There's no way the killer
could have predicted

780
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:26,093
which competitors would make it
to the terminal stage.

781
00:32:26,095 --> 00:32:28,795
That part of the game
was beyond his control.

782
00:32:28,797 --> 00:32:30,664
If it weren't,
he would've been prepared

783
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:33,300
to dispose of a body
the size of Ike Wallaczek's.

784
00:32:33,302 --> 00:32:35,335
So, even if there were a
connection between the victims,

785
00:32:35,337 --> 00:32:37,070
the killer could not
have counted on them

786
00:32:37,072 --> 00:32:38,839
being lured into his trap.

787
00:32:38,841 --> 00:32:41,041
Certainly not
in sequence.

788
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:45,112
His game was, in many respects,
one of chance.

789
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:51,718
Suggesting he knows what
he wants, but not who has it.

790
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,888
Like he was on a puzzle hunt
of his own.

791
00:32:56,825 --> 00:32:58,859
I'm back.

792
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:05,665
I'll set up
downstairs, yeah?

793
00:33:09,138 --> 00:33:11,238
I've been thinking about
what you said earlier.

794
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,740
I've decided to engage her
one more time

795
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:15,609
with regards
to her recuperation.

796
00:33:17,112 --> 00:33:21,815
I doubt she'll listen,
but I'll keep you apprised.

797
00:33:25,954 --> 00:33:27,421
I've been thinking.

798
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:29,623
About?
You. Your history.

799
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:31,825
Your decision
not to seek help.

800
00:33:31,827 --> 00:33:34,594
I think it's
a mistake.

801
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,530
Oh?

802
00:33:36,532 --> 00:33:38,198
I've looked into a number
of support groups.

803
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,633
As you are well aware,

804
00:33:39,635 --> 00:33:41,701
I have benefited greatly
from similar settings.

805
00:33:41,703 --> 00:33:43,270
You have.

806
00:33:43,272 --> 00:33:44,638
The process, I find,

807
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,906
is not unlike
voiding one's bowels...

808
00:33:45,908 --> 00:33:47,808
I'll go.
What?

809
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:49,676
I'll go.
Just get me the details.

810
00:33:52,014 --> 00:33:55,182
I've been thinking, too-- about
your number-cruncher, Harlan.

811
00:33:55,184 --> 00:33:57,017
You think I was
too hard on him.

812
00:33:57,019 --> 00:33:58,685
You will have consultants
of your own one day.

813
00:33:58,687 --> 00:34:01,488
You'll see that they require
management and focus.

814
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:04,124
They are but keys on a keyboard,
and we're the typists.

815
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:06,159
You could've given him
a shoeing for all I care.

816
00:34:06,161 --> 00:34:07,828
No, I'm just saying that

817
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:10,030
some of the stuff he's got
up to, it's quite good.

818
00:34:10,032 --> 00:34:11,698
You should take a look.

819
00:34:13,368 --> 00:34:15,735
You may find a fellow typist.

820
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,076
Hello?

821
00:34:23,078 --> 00:34:25,312
Yeah, I
hear that you and some friends

822
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:27,848
are trying to identify
Mo Shellshocker.

823
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,649
That's right. Who is this?

824
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:32,719
His name is Harlan Emple.

825
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:34,020
You got a pen?

826
00:34:34,022 --> 00:34:36,456
I'll-I'll give you his address.

827
00:34:52,454 --> 00:34:54,020
Harlan.

828
00:34:54,022 --> 00:34:56,356
You can't take a hint, can you?

829
00:34:56,358 --> 00:34:57,657
I got your text messages.

830
00:34:57,659 --> 00:34:58,958
I don't want to see you
right now.

831
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,827
So if you came here
to apologize...

832
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:03,363
Actually, I came here
to spare you an agonizing death.

833
00:35:04,299 --> 00:35:05,832
Can I come in?

834
00:35:05,834 --> 00:35:08,301
I was puzzling earlier

835
00:35:08,303 --> 00:35:12,038
as to why the killer went
to such specific lengths.

836
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,606
What did he want?

837
00:35:13,608 --> 00:35:15,809
And then Watson,
quite by accident,

838
00:35:15,811 --> 00:35:17,410
she made a most
compelling analogy.

839
00:35:17,412 --> 00:35:20,080
She said it was as if he
was on a hunt of his own.

840
00:35:20,082 --> 00:35:22,615
Duh. He was hunting
mathematicians.

841
00:35:22,617 --> 00:35:23,783
No, he wasn't.

842
00:35:23,785 --> 00:35:25,151
He was hunting<i> a</i> mathematician.

843
00:35:25,153 --> 00:35:26,619
One.

844
00:35:26,621 --> 00:35:29,389
A man who had concealed
his identity not only

845
00:35:29,391 --> 00:35:31,191
from the mathematics
community at large,

846
00:35:31,193 --> 00:35:32,859
but also from the FBI.

847
00:35:32,861 --> 00:35:35,395
A “crusader,”
you might call him.

848
00:35:35,397 --> 00:35:36,763
Wait a minute.

849
00:35:36,765 --> 00:35:38,731
Are you saying that
this was all about me?

850
00:35:53,448 --> 00:35:56,449
<i> Unfortunately, emulating</i>
<i>the work of people like me</i>

851
00:35:56,451 --> 00:35:59,018
<i>is not without risks.</i>

852
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,320
Creates enemies.

853
00:36:00,322 --> 00:36:02,889
I knew it was the government.

854
00:36:02,891 --> 00:36:04,424
It was a lottery winner.

855
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,260
Little over a year ago,

856
00:36:07,262 --> 00:36:09,529
you started a series of blogs
where you exposed the flaws

857
00:36:09,531 --> 00:36:11,664
in certain scratch card
lottery games.

858
00:36:11,666 --> 00:36:13,766
Tickets like this one.

859
00:36:13,768 --> 00:36:15,802
I wrote about
baited hook games.

860
00:36:15,804 --> 00:36:17,971
Games where the numbers
are printed on the front.

861
00:36:17,973 --> 00:36:20,707
Scratch off the hidden numbers,
hope for a match.

862
00:36:20,709 --> 00:36:23,309
Only, you proved that with
careful mathematical analysis

863
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:25,512
of the visible numbers,
you could predict

864
00:36:25,514 --> 00:36:28,381
which tickets were winners
80% of the time.

865
00:36:28,383 --> 00:36:29,682
If you had exploited

866
00:36:29,684 --> 00:36:32,085
this flaw,
rather than exposing it,

867
00:36:32,087 --> 00:36:33,520
you could have made millions.

868
00:36:33,522 --> 00:36:36,022
Well... sure.
But that would been cheating.

869
00:36:36,024 --> 00:36:37,157
Right.

870
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:38,825
So imagine
for a moment

871
00:36:38,827 --> 00:36:41,060
that you are a less
honest mathematician.

872
00:36:41,062 --> 00:36:42,495
Right?

873
00:36:42,497 --> 00:36:44,063
You've been taking
advantage of these games

874
00:36:44,065 --> 00:36:47,967
for a couple of years to
amass a small fortune.

875
00:36:47,969 --> 00:36:49,502
And then “Mo"
comes along.

876
00:36:49,504 --> 00:36:51,971
He starts exposing
the broken games.

877
00:36:51,973 --> 00:36:54,340
State lottery commissions
shut them down.

878
00:36:54,342 --> 00:36:56,976
The exploitable
games dry up.

879
00:36:56,978 --> 00:37:00,613
Now, if you were a
psychopathic lottery cheat,

880
00:37:00,615 --> 00:37:02,582
how do you fix that?

881
00:37:02,584 --> 00:37:04,484
You kill Mo.

882
00:37:04,486 --> 00:37:07,253
<i>Unfortunately, Mo is elusive.</i>

883
00:37:07,255 --> 00:37:08,821
<i>Anonymous.</i>

884
00:37:08,823 --> 00:37:11,224
The only thing
he knew about him for sure

885
00:37:11,226 --> 00:37:14,394
was that he could not resist
a puzzle hunt.

886
00:37:14,396 --> 00:37:17,130
Now, if you were smart enough
to identify

887
00:37:17,132 --> 00:37:19,399
and take advantage of
broken lottery games...

888
00:37:19,401 --> 00:37:21,868
Then I'm smart enough
to design a puzzle hunt.

889
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:25,338
This plan was not
without its flaws.

890
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:28,775
Once a competitor
reached the terminal stage,

891
00:37:28,777 --> 00:37:32,745
the killer could not be certain
that he'd trapped Mo, could he?

892
00:37:32,747 --> 00:37:34,480
So he tortured them.

893
00:37:34,482 --> 00:37:37,083
I submit he forced them to
log on to Mo's Web site,

894
00:37:37,085 --> 00:37:39,686
and when they failed...

895
00:37:41,323 --> 00:37:42,755
After two murders,

896
00:37:42,757 --> 00:37:44,290
the game was compromised.

897
00:37:44,292 --> 00:37:46,192
So the killer devises
a Plan “B.”

898
00:37:46,194 --> 00:37:47,460
He tricks

899
00:37:47,462 --> 00:37:49,229
a group of his peers

900
00:37:49,231 --> 00:37:51,097
into helping search
for an alternative means

901
00:37:51,099 --> 00:37:53,032
of identifying Mo.

902
00:37:56,504 --> 00:37:58,438
You're talking about that guy.

903
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,906
The one with the penthouse.

904
00:37:59,908 --> 00:38:02,742
<i>Paul?</i>

905
00:38:02,744 --> 00:38:05,044
Lottery winners
are public record.

906
00:38:05,046 --> 00:38:07,814
So when I searched for
the names of repeat winners

907
00:38:07,816 --> 00:38:09,482
in the dates prior
to your posts...

908
00:38:09,484 --> 00:38:11,317
I can't believe
I drank his water.

909
00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:12,685
I called him.

910
00:38:12,687 --> 00:38:14,654
I identified you as Mo.

911
00:38:14,656 --> 00:38:16,122
And I gave him your address.

912
00:38:16,124 --> 00:38:17,590
You what?!

913
00:38:21,129 --> 00:38:23,062
Drop your weapon!

914
00:38:23,064 --> 00:38:24,597
<i>I did not, however, give him</i>

915
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:25,965
<i>the correct apartment number.</i>

916
00:38:25,967 --> 00:38:28,334
He was arrested
a little over an hour ago.

917
00:38:30,739 --> 00:38:31,871
Tried to call you to
tell you, but, um...

918
00:38:31,873 --> 00:38:33,539
But I was ignoring you.

919
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:35,008
Yes, you were ignoring me.

920
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,209
Look, you know

921
00:38:36,211 --> 00:38:37,377
that I'm still screwed, right?

922
00:38:37,379 --> 00:38:39,279
You told him that I'm Mo.

923
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:42,115
He's gonna tell the police,
they're gonna tell the FBI...

924
00:38:42,117 --> 00:38:43,516
The NYPD is under
the impression

925
00:38:43,518 --> 00:38:45,385
that I lied about
your connection to Mo

926
00:38:45,387 --> 00:38:47,920
in order to draw
Mr. Ettinger out.

927
00:38:47,922 --> 00:38:49,555
As far as the
FBI goes, well,

928
00:38:49,557 --> 00:38:51,958
I've got some associates
who have created a trail

929
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,860
which will
strongly suggest that Mo

930
00:38:53,862 --> 00:38:55,728
is a cyber-terrorist
I became aware of

931
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:58,197
whilst working for, um...

932
00:38:58,199 --> 00:38:59,766
queen and country.

933
00:38:59,768 --> 00:39:02,135
Your secret's
quite safe.

934
00:39:02,137 --> 00:39:03,903
Thanks.

935
00:39:06,508 --> 00:39:09,776
My reasons for preserving you
are entirely selfish, Harlan.

936
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:13,279
You are a tremendous asset.

937
00:39:13,281 --> 00:39:15,815
I have little doubt

938
00:39:15,817 --> 00:39:19,118
I will need your help again
in the future.

939
00:39:26,461 --> 00:39:28,528
Me or him?

940
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:29,996
You.

941
00:39:29,998 --> 00:39:31,798
I have an update on
that real estate flipper.

942
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,433
I thought you might
want to know.

943
00:39:39,274 --> 00:39:41,908
I tracked down the truck rental
receipts to get her name.

944
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,142
Valerie Cork.

945
00:39:43,144 --> 00:39:44,911
She's an art authenticator.

946
00:39:44,913 --> 00:39:46,779
And that crate you saw?

947
00:39:46,781 --> 00:39:48,414
There was
something called

948
00:39:48,416 --> 00:39:50,683
a scanning fluorescence
spectrometry machine inside.

949
00:39:50,685 --> 00:39:52,251
They're used...
To find paintings

950
00:39:52,253 --> 00:39:53,553
underneath other paintings.

951
00:39:53,555 --> 00:39:55,288
So it turns out
that the building

952
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:56,689
Chad Keswick was looking to buy

953
00:39:56,691 --> 00:39:59,025
was leased by the WPA
during the Depression.

954
00:39:59,027 --> 00:40:00,927
They commissioned a
mural for the lobby.

955
00:40:00,929 --> 00:40:03,329
The artist was a
notorious communist,

956
00:40:03,331 --> 00:40:05,365
so when the property passed
into private hands in the '50s,

957
00:40:05,367 --> 00:40:06,999
the new owners
had it painted over.

958
00:40:07,001 --> 00:40:08,735
But it was still there,
under the paint.

959
00:40:08,737 --> 00:40:11,037
A lost work by Diego Rivera.

960
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:13,473
It's worth ten times
the price of the building.

961
00:40:14,676 --> 00:40:17,043
I was hoping to leak
the truth to the<i> Times.</i>

962
00:40:18,113 --> 00:40:20,046
I promised you a cut of my fee.

963
00:40:20,048 --> 00:40:22,148
But I'm pretty sure
the mural's gonna end up

964
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:24,384
in the hands of
a historical trust.

965
00:40:24,386 --> 00:40:26,352
I'd feel obligated
to refund my client,

966
00:40:26,354 --> 00:40:28,388
which means you'd get
a cut of nothing.

967
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:31,457
That works for me.

968
00:40:31,459 --> 00:40:33,493
Okay.

969
00:40:35,463 --> 00:40:37,397
I think you should know

970
00:40:37,399 --> 00:40:39,732
that I am going
to a meeting tonight.

971
00:40:41,803 --> 00:40:45,505
One of those
support groups for...

972
00:40:45,507 --> 00:40:47,340
people like me.

973
00:40:47,342 --> 00:40:49,876
It was, uh, Sherlock's idea.

974
00:40:49,878 --> 00:40:51,644
That's great.

975
00:40:51,646 --> 00:40:53,446
I know you put him up to it.

976
00:40:53,448 --> 00:40:55,381
We talked.

977
00:40:57,552 --> 00:41:00,219
When he first approached me
in London,

978
00:41:00,221 --> 00:41:03,556
I was...

979
00:41:03,558 --> 00:41:05,558
in a bad way.

980
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,227
And I had been for a while.

981
00:41:08,229 --> 00:41:11,130
But then,
when he talked about

982
00:41:11,132 --> 00:41:12,365
the work that he did,

983
00:41:12,367 --> 00:41:16,035
about the things
that he saw in me...

984
00:41:18,406 --> 00:41:19,739
I want it.

985
00:41:19,741 --> 00:41:21,874
I want every bit
of what's he offered me,

986
00:41:21,876 --> 00:41:23,843
of what he offered you, but...

987
00:41:23,845 --> 00:41:26,212
if I've learned one thing
over the last few weeks,

988
00:41:26,214 --> 00:41:28,047
it's that he can't pull it off.

989
00:41:28,049 --> 00:41:29,682
Not by himself, anyway.

990
00:41:31,586 --> 00:41:34,153
And if I'm gonna get
what I want,

991
00:41:34,155 --> 00:41:37,690
then I'm going to need
your help, too.

992
00:41:40,361 --> 00:41:42,829
I still think
the meetings are bollocks,

993
00:41:42,831 --> 00:41:44,931
but you say they're important.

994
00:41:44,933 --> 00:41:47,967
They matter to you, so...

995
00:41:47,969 --> 00:41:49,735
What do you say, Watson?

996
00:41:49,737 --> 00:41:52,071
Will you help me?

997
00:41:56,277 --> 00:41:58,244
I don't know how it happened.

998
00:41:58,246 --> 00:42:01,547
It just... hit me.

999
00:42:01,549 --> 00:42:03,983
Like a truck, out of nowhere.

1000
00:42:04,853 --> 00:42:07,753
Work is good.

1001
00:42:07,755 --> 00:42:09,755
I have friends.

1002
00:42:09,757 --> 00:42:13,092
I'm in a
relationship.

1003
00:42:13,094 --> 00:42:16,896
Somewhere along
the way, somehow,

1004
00:42:16,898 --> 00:42:19,732
I stopped being a victim

1005
00:42:19,734 --> 00:42:22,602
and became a survivor.

1006
00:42:22,604 --> 00:42:25,705
So, I guess all I'm saying is,
there's hope.

1007
00:42:26,357 --> 00:42:31,686
Do the work. Love yourself.
There's hope.

If you're looking for Sherlock,
he's downstairs.

3
00:00:04,785 --> 00:00:05,841
Okay.

4
00:00:05,842 --> 00:00:07,541
<i>His name is Harlan Emple.</i>

<i>He is the Rachel P. Hanson</i>

for Applied Mathematics
at Columbia University.

7
00:00:11,301 --> 00:00:14,502
What I don't get is
why he isn't wearing a shirt.

8
00:00:14,504 --> 00:00:17,372
He doesn't like anything to come
between him and the numbers.

9
00:00:17,374 --> 00:00:18,415
What is it?

10
00:00:18,438 --> 00:00:20,274
The answers to your questions
about Kitty.

11
00:00:20,276 --> 00:00:22,710
The truth is she was a
victim of a horrific crime.

12
00:00:22,712 --> 00:00:24,646
<i>After you left last night,</i>

13
00:00:24,648 --> 00:00:26,848
Sherlock gave me an envelope.

14
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,249
Sherlock keeps saying

15
00:00:28,251 --> 00:00:30,385
that I need to get
a better sense of you,

16
00:00:30,387 --> 00:00:33,021
and maybe that will give you
a better sense of me.

17
00:00:42,065 --> 00:00:43,065
It's open.

18
00:00:47,637 --> 00:00:49,003
It's nothing.

19
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:50,872
It's Sherlock and
one of his experts.

20
00:00:50,874 --> 00:00:52,006
Which one?

21
00:00:52,008 --> 00:00:53,241
Phillip something.

22
00:00:53,243 --> 00:00:54,575
Must be new.

23
00:00:54,577 --> 00:00:57,445
He's a knife-thrower.

24
00:00:57,447 --> 00:00:58,913
Why does Sherlock have
a knife-thrower?

25
00:00:58,915 --> 00:01:00,748
He got bored the other day,

26
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,185
started looking into this, uh,
circus accident from the '30s.

27
00:01:04,187 --> 00:01:07,922
The Great Galardo perforated one
of his assistants during an act,

28
00:01:07,924 --> 00:01:09,924
except Sherlock thinks
the blade was thrown

29
00:01:09,926 --> 00:01:11,492
by somebody in the stands,
not Galardo.

30
00:01:11,494 --> 00:01:15,096
Phillip, as far as I
can tell, disagrees.

31
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:18,900
It can't be done, okay?

32
00:01:18,902 --> 00:01:19,934
It was done.

33
00:01:19,936 --> 00:01:21,335
You're wrong.

34
00:01:21,337 --> 00:01:23,538
Nobody can chuck
a knife that far.

35
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,239
What's this?

36
00:01:25,241 --> 00:01:26,207
You're...

37
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:27,209
Not here.

38
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,509
I'm not here.

39
00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:29,711
Remember that, okay?

40
00:01:29,713 --> 00:01:31,279
Oh, yes. Heaven
forfend your work

41
00:01:31,281 --> 00:01:33,247
with me should endanger
your precious day job.

42
00:01:33,249 --> 00:01:35,116
You throw knives?

43
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,252
You know, it was supposed
to be just you here.

44
00:01:38,254 --> 00:01:41,355
Phillip is arguably the greatest
knife-thrower in the world.

45
00:01:41,357 --> 00:01:42,790
Has been for decades.

46
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:43,925
Only, there's little money

47
00:01:43,927 --> 00:01:45,193
to be made
in the impalement arts.

48
00:01:45,195 --> 00:01:46,494
So, as a youth, he turned

49
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,563
to what you Americans
term “football”"

50
00:01:48,565 --> 00:01:50,131
Is this a joke?

51
00:01:53,837 --> 00:01:55,002
Phillip, head
and heart.

52
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:56,904
Come on.
Head and heart.

53
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:06,814
Can I go?

54
00:02:06,816 --> 00:02:09,484
Yeah.

55
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,489
15 years he spent throwing
that misshapen ball around.

56
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:16,057
15 years.

57
00:02:16,059 --> 00:02:18,259
When I think of the acclaim
he could have brought

58
00:02:18,261 --> 00:02:20,828
to competitive blade slinging.

59
00:02:27,237 --> 00:02:29,036
You're following me,
Watson.

60
00:02:29,038 --> 00:02:30,338
I don't like it.

61
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,740
I want you to help
me with something.

62
00:02:32,742 --> 00:02:33,908
This is Chad Keswick.

63
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,976
He buys distressed
buildings,

64
00:02:34,978 --> 00:02:36,210
paints, spackles,

65
00:02:36,212 --> 00:02:37,645
and then flips them
for quick money.

66
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:39,180
Who'd he kill?
No one.

67
00:02:39,182 --> 00:02:41,315
I was hired by one of
his rivals to find out

68
00:02:41,317 --> 00:02:43,017
why he's been circling
this old office building

69
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:44,218
in Jamaica, Queens.

70
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,586
She wants to know
why he thinks

71
00:02:45,588 --> 00:02:47,355
the building is
a good investment.

72
00:02:47,357 --> 00:02:49,590
Is there a crime in there,
something worth investigating?

73
00:02:49,592 --> 00:02:50,925
Well, I've been
shadowing Keswick,

74
00:02:50,927 --> 00:02:52,593
but yesterday I think
he noticed me.

75
00:02:52,595 --> 00:02:54,595
I want to switch
up the tail.

76
00:02:54,597 --> 00:02:57,231
You followed me for over
a week before I noticed you.

77
00:02:57,233 --> 00:02:59,033
Help me out, and I'll
cut you in on my fee.

78
00:02:59,035 --> 00:03:02,003
I don't work for you,
I work for Sherlock.

79
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:03,437
I worked for him, too.

80
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,773
And, in my experience,
he was always supportive

81
00:03:05,775 --> 00:03:07,942
of taking on work
outside the partnership.

82
00:03:07,944 --> 00:03:10,912
Sorry, it's not my cup of tea.

83
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:33,034
Hello, Portal Ten.

84
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,247
I'm here, Belphegor.

85
00:03:46,249 --> 00:03:49,784
So where is the next clue?

Yeah, you called it
a puzzle hunt.

91
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,491
Belphegor's Prime.

92
00:04:50,761 --> 00:04:53,262
Think Cicada 3301
or Octorine's Challenge.

93
00:04:54,365 --> 00:04:55,631
They're math games.

94
00:04:55,633 --> 00:04:56,865
Math-- maybe you've heard of it.

95
00:04:56,867 --> 00:04:58,333
I've got some math for you.

96
00:04:58,335 --> 00:05:00,335
One dead guy
plus one live guy

97
00:05:00,337 --> 00:05:02,104
found in the same
deserted factory.

98
00:05:02,106 --> 00:05:06,108
I was not “found” there;
I am the one who called 911.

99
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,310
I was waiting there
for the police.

100
00:05:08,312 --> 00:05:09,745
Mr. Emple,

101
00:05:09,747 --> 00:05:11,613
we're just trying
to do our jobs, all right?

102
00:05:11,615 --> 00:05:13,048
First officers
on the scene described you

103
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,516
as “extremely agitated.”

104
00:05:14,518 --> 00:05:15,984
Well, of course
I was agitated.

105
00:05:15,986 --> 00:05:18,754
I had just found
a dead guy in mothballs!

106
00:05:18,756 --> 00:05:21,790
And did I mention that I have
not slept in almost two days?

107
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:23,358
Because of the math game.

108
00:05:24,762 --> 00:05:26,195
Can I borrow those?

109
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:31,100
This...

110
00:05:31,102 --> 00:05:33,302
is Belphegor's Prime, okay?

111
00:05:33,304 --> 00:05:35,304
It's a numeric palindrome.

112
00:05:35,306 --> 00:05:40,776
It's 666 bookended by 13 zeroes
and then bracketed with ones.

113
00:05:40,778 --> 00:05:43,846
Named for the demon Belphegor
who was a prince of hell.

114
00:05:43,848 --> 00:05:46,448
The first clue for the hunt
started making the rounds

115
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,883
a few months ago.

116
00:05:47,885 --> 00:05:49,651
It was a JPEG with two numbers
hidden in it.

117
00:05:49,653 --> 00:05:51,453
You divide those numbers
by Belphegor's Prime,

118
00:05:51,455 --> 00:05:54,890
and you get the GPS coordinates
for a restroom at the Bronx Zoo.

119
00:05:54,892 --> 00:05:56,959
You go to the restroom,
you find a phone number.

120
00:05:56,961 --> 00:05:58,927
You send a text to the number,
you get the next clue.

121
00:05:58,929 --> 00:05:59,962
Which is another math problem.

122
00:05:59,964 --> 00:06:00,929
Exactly.

123
00:06:00,931 --> 00:06:02,397
Only, this one is harder.

124
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,099
And that's how it works.

125
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:05,934
You know, but for
each one that you solve,

126
00:06:05,936 --> 00:06:08,103
you get a new set
of GPS coordinates.

127
00:06:08,105 --> 00:06:11,473
And that means that you've
completed a stage, or a portal.

128
00:06:11,475 --> 00:06:13,509
And last night,
I was on Portal Ten.

129
00:06:13,511 --> 00:06:15,711
And...

130
00:06:17,014 --> 00:06:18,313
You know what?

131
00:06:18,315 --> 00:06:20,015
I want to talk
to Sherlock and Joan.

132
00:06:20,017 --> 00:06:21,917
Look, Mr. Emple...
No, I'm sorry.

133
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,019
I told the police down
at the factory that I know them.

134
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:25,287
Isn't that the whole reason

135
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:26,922
that I was brought here
to this squad?

136
00:06:26,924 --> 00:06:30,392
I-I am not saying another word
until they are here.

137
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:35,264
Harlan Emple is
indeed an acquaintance.

138
00:06:35,266 --> 00:06:37,733
He is, in point of fact,
one of my “irregulars.”

139
00:06:37,735 --> 00:06:38,801
One of your what?

140
00:06:38,803 --> 00:06:40,302
Irregulars.

141
00:06:40,304 --> 00:06:41,770
I'm your consultant, Captain;
they are mine.

142
00:06:41,772 --> 00:06:43,572
They're a handful
of experts I turn to

143
00:06:43,574 --> 00:06:46,108
when I encounter problems which
are beyond my pool of knowledge.

144
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,810
Harlan is
a brilliant mathematician.

145
00:06:47,812 --> 00:06:49,778
And on the handful of occasions
I have tackled a case

146
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,046
which pertained
to mathematics...

147
00:06:51,048 --> 00:06:53,182
He helped you out.
Well, the good news

148
00:06:53,184 --> 00:06:56,018
for him is the preliminary
autopsy report just came in

149
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,252
before you got here.

150
00:06:57,254 --> 00:06:59,021
And the M.E. puts
the time of death

151
00:06:59,023 --> 00:07:00,989
between 4:00 and
6:00 p.m. last night.

152
00:07:00,991 --> 00:07:02,124
Mr. Emple was teaching

153
00:07:02,126 --> 00:07:03,358
a class at Columbia.

154
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,394
So the victim is
yet to be identified?

155
00:07:05,396 --> 00:07:07,663
No I.D., no phone.

156
00:07:07,665 --> 00:07:09,865
First detective on the scene
liked it for a mob hit,

157
00:07:09,867 --> 00:07:11,500
so while we're
running the prints,

158
00:07:11,502 --> 00:07:13,602
he's showing the vic's
face around OCID.

159
00:07:13,604 --> 00:07:16,839
Marcus here was about to walk
the scene with Mr. Emple.

160
00:07:16,841 --> 00:07:18,774
You're here now;
you might as well tag along.

161
00:07:18,776 --> 00:07:21,009
Actually, Captain,
I'm quite busy today.

162
00:07:21,011 --> 00:07:22,978
This is a John Doe,
and we got nothing.

163
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,247
And, like you just said,
you're my consultant.

164
00:07:25,249 --> 00:07:26,748
So, go consult.

165
00:07:29,787 --> 00:07:30,986
Watson.

166
00:07:30,988 --> 00:07:32,588
Um, he's your friend.

167
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,523
Actually, Kitty is
otherwise engaged,

168
00:07:34,525 --> 00:07:37,426
and he did actually help both
of us with a case last year.

169
00:07:37,428 --> 00:07:38,493
Did he not?

170
00:07:40,865 --> 00:07:44,099
Have I told you
how good it is to see you?

171
00:07:44,101 --> 00:07:45,367
Yes, you have.
Three times.

172
00:07:45,369 --> 00:07:46,468
Well, it is.

173
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,636
Hey, lousy circumstances.

174
00:07:47,638 --> 00:07:49,371
But, uh, hey...

175
00:07:49,373 --> 00:07:51,740
I heard from your boss that you
just, uh, got back from London.

176
00:07:51,742 --> 00:07:53,308
Were you working
a case or...?

177
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,576
No, I moved back there.

178
00:07:54,578 --> 00:07:55,677
You mean<i> moved,</i> moved?

179
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:56,845
Is there another
definition?

180
00:07:56,847 --> 00:07:58,513
I was there for
eight months,

181
00:07:58,515 --> 00:08:00,883
and had a change of heart
and returned to New York.

182
00:08:00,885 --> 00:08:02,517
So, you moved to London,
and you didn't, uh...

183
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,086
You know what?
Doesn't even matter.

184
00:08:04,088 --> 00:08:05,387
The point is you're back!

185
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:07,389
Mr. Emple.
Uh, duty calls.

186
00:08:07,391 --> 00:08:09,024
Yeah.

187
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:18,634
It's interesting.

188
00:08:18,636 --> 00:08:20,068
Mothballs are interesting?

189
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,070
They were taken from
that cabinet over there.

190
00:08:22,072 --> 00:08:25,941
Obviously, to cover the smell
of John Doe's decay.

191
00:08:25,943 --> 00:08:28,043
The killer didn't
bring them with him.

192
00:08:28,045 --> 00:08:31,179
Perhaps leaving the body here
was not part of his plan, hmm?

193
00:08:32,983 --> 00:08:36,018
Doe was shot in the foot
first and then the knee.

194
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,453
Either those were
two really bad misses or...

195
00:08:38,455 --> 00:08:41,256
Or the killer was torturing him.

196
00:08:41,258 --> 00:08:43,892
This doesn't seem like anything
you can't handle on your own.

197
00:08:43,894 --> 00:08:45,994
So you want to tell me why you
really asked me to come here?

198
00:08:45,996 --> 00:08:48,363
“This doesn't seem like anything
you can't handle on your own.”

199
00:08:48,365 --> 00:08:49,765
That's funny.

200
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:51,566
That's exactly what
I would have said

201
00:08:51,568 --> 00:08:53,602
had I been present when you
asked Kitty for her assistance

202
00:08:53,604 --> 00:08:54,937
with your tawdry side job.

203
00:08:54,939 --> 00:08:57,372
“Tawdry”?
I wanted you to know I approve.

204
00:08:57,374 --> 00:08:59,007
Of what?

205
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:01,376
Your agenda
with regards to Kitty.

206
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:03,078
Several days ago,
I gave you her file.

207
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,913
And then you show up at
the brownstone yesterday,

208
00:09:04,915 --> 00:09:06,515
and you invite her
into an investigation.

209
00:09:06,517 --> 00:09:08,183
Coincidence? No, I think not.

210
00:09:08,185 --> 00:09:11,320
You feel for her.
And now you wish to engage.

211
00:09:11,322 --> 00:09:13,956
It's not an outcome
I would have predicted, no.

212
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,458
But it is one
I approve of, yeah.

213
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,193
She could learn
a great deal from you,

214
00:09:18,195 --> 00:09:20,228
especially with regards
to how to get the most

215
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,864
from my tutelage.

216
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:25,734
So, I've already dispatched her
to, uh, follow your Mr. Keswick.

217
00:09:25,736 --> 00:09:27,836
But that's not
what I actually...

218
00:09:27,838 --> 00:09:29,404
Harlan!

219
00:09:30,741 --> 00:09:33,075
You came here to retrieve
a phone number, did you not?

220
00:09:33,077 --> 00:09:34,609
You would send a text,
and then receive

221
00:09:34,611 --> 00:09:36,845
the next clue in the game
that you were playing.

222
00:09:36,847 --> 00:09:38,747
Yeah, but I didn't find it.

223
00:09:38,749 --> 00:09:40,048
Not that I kept looking

224
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,250
after the dead guy
fell out of the locker.

225
00:09:42,252 --> 00:09:44,052
Yeah, CSU didn't find
any number either.

226
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:46,154
Probably because
it's under that paint.

227
00:09:46,156 --> 00:09:48,190
It's fresh.

228
00:09:48,192 --> 00:09:49,891
Applied in the last

229
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:52,694
24 hours.

230
00:09:52,696 --> 00:09:54,696
Right after John Doe's murder,
I'd wager.

231
00:09:54,698 --> 00:09:57,099
You don't think
this was a mob hit?

232
00:09:57,101 --> 00:09:59,101
Doe and the killer were
playing the game, too.

233
00:09:59,103 --> 00:10:01,203
The killer shot Doe and
then covered up the number

234
00:10:01,205 --> 00:10:02,704
so no one else could use it.

235
00:10:02,706 --> 00:10:04,806
What's the prize
in your little contest?

236
00:10:04,808 --> 00:10:07,576
Well, I'm doing it
mostly for the math.

237
00:10:07,578 --> 00:10:11,480
But, uh, $1,707,071.

238
00:10:11,482 --> 00:10:13,882
It's another
palindromic prime.

239
00:10:13,884 --> 00:10:17,152
Did I not mention the
money at the station?

240
00:10:17,154 --> 00:10:18,587
Who the hell can afford

241
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:20,655
that kind of payout
for a puzzle hunt?

242
00:10:20,657 --> 00:10:22,124
Well, most people
think it's CAML.

243
00:10:22,126 --> 00:10:24,593
The Center for Applied
Mathematics and Logic.

244
00:10:24,595 --> 00:10:26,094
It's located
in Ramapo...

245
00:10:26,096 --> 00:10:27,729
Wait, most people
“think” it's them?

246
00:10:27,731 --> 00:10:29,331
Well, hunts like these,

247
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,266
the organizers are
almost always anonymous.

248
00:10:31,268 --> 00:10:32,401
It's S.O.P.

249
00:10:32,403 --> 00:10:34,302
What about the
contestants?

250
00:10:34,304 --> 00:10:37,005
Is anonymity
also S.O.P.?

251
00:10:37,007 --> 00:10:39,207
For the most part, yeah.

252
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:43,078
But, guys, math peeps
are my peeps, okay?

253
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,314
It's, uh, like
a community, sort of.

254
00:10:46,316 --> 00:10:48,984
I can think of ten
or 12 other people

255
00:10:48,986 --> 00:10:50,018
who were probably competing.

256
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,186
Would that help?

257
00:10:53,157 --> 00:10:55,223
No.

258
00:10:55,225 --> 00:10:58,026
I'm sorry, I don't know him.

259
00:10:58,028 --> 00:11:00,862
But you admit you were
competing in Belphegor's Prime.

260
00:11:00,864 --> 00:11:02,197
I do.

261
00:11:04,835 --> 00:11:05,934
Pepe!

262
00:11:08,172 --> 00:11:10,439
Sorry. He doesn't
like strangers.

263
00:11:12,109 --> 00:11:14,443
Give him one of these.

264
00:11:14,445 --> 00:11:16,111
Get on his good side.

265
00:11:24,288 --> 00:11:26,354
What are you doing?

266
00:11:28,225 --> 00:11:30,725
I'm just verifying that
you've been lying to us.

267
00:11:30,727 --> 00:11:33,895
You did know the
dead man, did you not?

268
00:11:33,897 --> 00:11:36,998
I reviewed his personal
effects at the morgue earlier.

269
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,034
The coroner reported finding
crumbs in one of his pockets.

270
00:11:39,036 --> 00:11:40,036
I tasted one.

271
00:11:40,037 --> 00:11:41,269
Why would you...?

272
00:11:41,271 --> 00:11:42,771
At first, I thought
they were from

273
00:11:42,773 --> 00:11:44,439
a particularly rancid
brand of cheese,

274
00:11:44,441 --> 00:11:47,609
but, no... they're from
one of Pepe's treats.

275
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:49,277
Homemade?

276
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,481
Harlan was able to give us
the names of nine other people

277
00:11:52,483 --> 00:11:54,149
he believed to be
other competitors.

278
00:11:54,151 --> 00:11:55,984
Our colleagues are
investigating them as we speak,

279
00:11:55,986 --> 00:11:57,919
but I'll quite happily
recommend that the NYPD

280
00:11:57,921 --> 00:12:00,222
focus its attention
entirely on you.

281
00:12:04,128 --> 00:12:06,428
His name was Ike Walaczek.

282
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,231
In another lifetime,
he was my boyfriend.

283
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:10,866
And what of
this lifetime?

284
00:12:10,868 --> 00:12:12,701
We were working together.

285
00:12:12,703 --> 00:12:14,769
On Belphegor's.
What?!

286
00:12:14,771 --> 00:12:16,705
He was a numerical analyst
at the Tory Foundation.

287
00:12:16,707 --> 00:12:17,873
I work mostly in combinatorics.

288
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,307
I thought we would make
a good team.

289
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:20,742
But there aren't
supposed to be teams.

290
00:12:20,744 --> 00:12:22,711
Not in a puzzle hunt.
It's bad form.

291
00:12:22,713 --> 00:12:23,713
Harlan...

292
00:12:23,714 --> 00:12:25,514
I'm just saying...

293
00:12:25,516 --> 00:12:27,315
My husband
wouldn't understand,

294
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:30,385
so I decided I wouldn't tell him
until after we won the money.

295
00:12:30,387 --> 00:12:33,121
A team-- so that's how
you got there before me.

296
00:12:33,123 --> 00:12:34,489
I wasn't there.

297
00:12:34,491 --> 00:12:36,258
Tom and I were out of town
until this morning.

298
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,126
His cousin
was getting married in Hawaii.

299
00:12:38,128 --> 00:12:40,662
That's why Ike went
to the coordinates by himself.

300
00:12:40,664 --> 00:12:42,097
Because I couldn't.

301
00:12:44,268 --> 00:12:46,601
These are pictures I took.

302
00:12:46,603 --> 00:12:49,337
Check the dates.

303
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:51,506
You gave the police
nine other names?

304
00:12:51,508 --> 00:12:53,408
People you thought
were competing?

305
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,776
I've got 16.

306
00:12:54,778 --> 00:12:56,311
And I know they were competing.

307
00:12:58,448 --> 00:13:01,249
He talked to her
outside the Jamaica property

308
00:13:01,251 --> 00:13:05,720
for about 20 minutes,
and then this truck rolled up.

309
00:13:05,722 --> 00:13:07,822
Any idea what's
inside the crate?

310
00:13:07,824 --> 00:13:09,024
Nope.

311
00:13:09,026 --> 00:13:10,392
I can't identify
the woman either.

312
00:13:10,394 --> 00:13:12,260
Everything about her
said money though.

313
00:13:12,262 --> 00:13:15,363
She, Keswick
and the mystery box

314
00:13:15,365 --> 00:13:17,732
stayed inside the building
for about three hours,

315
00:13:17,734 --> 00:13:20,001
and then off they went.

316
00:13:20,904 --> 00:13:22,170
Good.

317
00:13:22,172 --> 00:13:23,872
Okay.

318
00:13:23,874 --> 00:13:26,074
You know where
to send the check.

319
00:13:26,076 --> 00:13:30,145
You haven't asked me about
the file Sherlock gave me.

320
00:13:30,147 --> 00:13:32,080
Why would I?

321
00:13:32,082 --> 00:13:36,184
You said it would give me
a better sense of you-- it did.

322
00:13:37,588 --> 00:13:40,155
That's why you asked
for my help.

323
00:13:40,157 --> 00:13:41,990
Because you felt sorry for me.

324
00:13:41,992 --> 00:13:44,226
No.

325
00:13:44,228 --> 00:13:46,194
You just don't seem interested
in anything

326
00:13:46,196 --> 00:13:48,063
outside of becoming
a detective.

327
00:13:48,065 --> 00:13:50,999
There she is.

328
00:13:51,001 --> 00:13:53,301
The old counselor.

329
00:13:53,303 --> 00:13:55,637
Who used to hold
Sherlock's hand.

330
00:13:57,608 --> 00:13:59,741
Everything that you read,

331
00:13:59,743 --> 00:14:02,510
everything that happened to me,
that's all it is.

332
00:14:02,512 --> 00:14:04,646
It's just something
that happened.

333
00:14:04,648 --> 00:14:08,116
And it's all
in the past now.

334
00:14:08,118 --> 00:14:10,685
So let's just
leave it there, shall we?

335
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:24,667
Hello.

336
00:14:24,668 --> 00:14:26,001
You've had sex.

337
00:14:26,003 --> 00:14:27,202
Excuse me?

338
00:14:27,204 --> 00:14:28,503
I can hear it
in your voice.

339
00:14:28,505 --> 00:14:29,771
You've joined paunches.

340
00:14:29,773 --> 00:14:30,972
Good for you, Watson.

341
00:14:30,974 --> 00:14:32,807
As you know, I think
the act of love

342
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:34,676
can be quite conducive to...
What do you want?

343
00:14:34,678 --> 00:14:36,911
Merely to apprise you
of a new development

344
00:14:36,913 --> 00:14:38,280
in the murder of
Ike Walaczek.

345
00:14:38,282 --> 00:14:40,115
As I informed
you yesterday,

346
00:14:40,117 --> 00:14:42,284
Harlan and I were given
a new list of competitors.

347
00:14:42,286 --> 00:14:45,320
One name leapt out:
Byron Lowenthal.

348
00:14:45,322 --> 00:14:48,156
He's a statistician at the
Public Utilities Commission

349
00:14:48,158 --> 00:14:50,425
and a diagnosed
paranoid schizophrenic.

350
00:14:50,427 --> 00:14:52,160
He's been hospitalized
for becoming violent

351
00:14:52,162 --> 00:14:53,728
on no fewer
than three occasions.

352
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,964
Certainly sounds like
it could be our guy.

353
00:14:55,966 --> 00:14:59,367
Unfortunately, Mr. Lowenthal had
another break earlier this year.

354
00:14:59,369 --> 00:15:02,137
He's been staying in
a transient hotel ever since.

355
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:04,239
Detective Bell and I
are going to speak with him.

356
00:15:04,241 --> 00:15:05,307
You want me to meet you?

357
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:06,875
Oh, no, we're already here.

358
00:15:06,877 --> 00:15:08,410
Anyway, now that I know
that you've enjoyed coitus

359
00:15:08,412 --> 00:15:09,778
and could enjoy more
in the near future...

360
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,846
When you're done,
we need to talk.

361
00:15:14,718 --> 00:15:16,818
Byron Lowenthal,
you in there?

362
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,053
Who is it?

363
00:15:18,055 --> 00:15:19,754
It's Detective Bell, NYPD.

364
00:15:19,756 --> 00:15:22,257
My colleague and I would like
to ask you some questions.

365
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:24,592
Let me
get some pants on.

366
00:15:37,341 --> 00:15:40,008
S-Sorry, I just... I, um...

367
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,310
I-I thought I heard
Mr. Lowenthal retr...

368
00:16:19,154 --> 00:16:21,267
You guys got lucky.

369
00:16:21,268 --> 00:16:22,868
Well, luck had little
to do with it, actually.

370
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,536
I... I heard Mr. Lowenthal

371
00:16:24,538 --> 00:16:27,039
pulling a heavy object off
a shelf, placing it on his bed,

372
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,041
and the sound of
the zipper indicated

373
00:16:29,043 --> 00:16:30,976
that it was
a large gun case.

374
00:16:30,978 --> 00:16:33,579
Looks like he was sane enough
to do math, but not much else.

375
00:16:33,581 --> 00:16:34,747
Plus, he was
pretty hopped up.

376
00:16:34,749 --> 00:16:36,448
Caffeine pills,
energy drinks,

377
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,251
pretty much every legal
stimulant you can buy.

378
00:16:39,253 --> 00:16:40,853
Plus a few illegal ones.

379
00:16:40,855 --> 00:16:42,821
Hmm. Obviously, he was
keeping himself awake

380
00:16:42,823 --> 00:16:44,490
so he could work on
Belphegor's.

381
00:16:44,492 --> 00:16:47,392
This... is obvious to you?

382
00:16:47,394 --> 00:16:48,961
I confess the maths
are beyond me,

383
00:16:48,963 --> 00:16:51,130
but I took the liberty of
sending pictures of what

384
00:16:51,132 --> 00:16:52,865
appear to be Mr. Lowenthal's
most recent scribbles

385
00:16:52,867 --> 00:16:54,166
to Harlan Emple,
and he's confirmed

386
00:16:54,168 --> 00:16:55,667
they are part of the contest.

387
00:16:55,669 --> 00:16:56,969
With your permission,
I'd like copies of these

388
00:16:56,971 --> 00:16:58,837
sent to my home
so he can review them.

389
00:16:58,839 --> 00:16:59,972
What for?

390
00:16:59,974 --> 00:17:01,073
If Byron Lowenthal

391
00:17:01,075 --> 00:17:02,441
did kill Ike Walaczek,

392
00:17:02,443 --> 00:17:04,109
then he used
and obscured a phone number,

393
00:17:04,111 --> 00:17:05,878
which would have yielded
the next problem.

394
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,379
That problem's solution

395
00:17:07,381 --> 00:17:08,714
would be GPS coordinates.

396
00:17:08,716 --> 00:17:10,415
If he's recorded them
in his books...

397
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:12,551
Your pal will be able to tell us
where he's headed next.

398
00:17:12,553 --> 00:17:14,853
I'll get our guys to give you

399
00:17:14,855 --> 00:17:16,388
whatever you need.

400
00:17:17,258 --> 00:17:18,991
Scans are still coming through,

401
00:17:18,993 --> 00:17:21,260
but I've put what we've got
so far up on the wall.

402
00:17:21,262 --> 00:17:23,262
Sherlock said that
you prefer it that way.

403
00:17:23,264 --> 00:17:25,030
Picked it up from him,
actually.

404
00:17:25,032 --> 00:17:28,600
Makes me feel like I'm really
inside of the problem.

405
00:17:30,704 --> 00:17:33,372
I'll, uh, let you know
if I need anything.

406
00:17:34,275 --> 00:17:35,974
Oh, I work without a shirt.

407
00:17:35,976 --> 00:17:38,911
Sometimes makes me feel
closer to the numbers.

408
00:17:38,913 --> 00:17:42,147
You'll need to, uh,
check the printer in the study

409
00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:43,615
for more pages.

410
00:17:43,617 --> 00:17:45,417
Uh, this is nice,
you know?

411
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:47,452
Meeting another member
of the team.

412
00:17:47,454 --> 00:17:48,654
You know, Team Sherlock.

413
00:17:48,656 --> 00:17:50,656
You help him, I help him...

414
00:17:51,926 --> 00:17:53,559
Obviously, you haven't
tackled a case

415
00:17:53,561 --> 00:17:55,093
with high-order math since
you started working with him,

416
00:17:55,095 --> 00:17:57,729
or we would've...

417
00:17:57,731 --> 00:17:59,031
What?

418
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:00,232
What?

419
00:18:00,234 --> 00:18:01,834
Wait...

420
00:18:01,836 --> 00:18:04,002
have you worked a case
with high-order math?

421
00:18:04,805 --> 00:18:06,238
You have, haven't you?

422
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,840
Does it matter?

423
00:18:07,842 --> 00:18:09,842
Of course it...

424
00:18:09,844 --> 00:18:11,443
Oh, my God.

425
00:18:11,445 --> 00:18:13,278
Did he fire me?

426
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,980
All I know
is that back in London,

427
00:18:14,982 --> 00:18:16,982
we worked a case that involved
Fibonacci spirals...

428
00:18:16,984 --> 00:18:18,483
He fired me.

429
00:18:18,485 --> 00:18:21,386
...and he called some woman
named Indira Patel.

430
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,856
She's at Berkeley.

431
00:18:23,858 --> 00:18:25,624
I'm three time zones closer!

432
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:27,125
You're here now.

433
00:18:27,127 --> 00:18:29,428
Sure, because I found
a dead body.

434
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,531
I have to go; I have to run
some errands for Sherlock.

435
00:18:35,936 --> 00:18:37,903
I-I don't know
what was in the crate,

436
00:18:37,905 --> 00:18:39,271
but the stenciling on
the side indicates

437
00:18:39,273 --> 00:18:40,772
it came from one of
the SUNY schools.

438
00:18:40,774 --> 00:18:42,908
I put another detective
on Keswick...

439
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:45,177
Don't kill me, I had to
use your razor to shave.

440
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:47,179
I...

441
00:18:47,181 --> 00:18:49,147
You must be Andrew.

442
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:50,515
Sherlock Holmes.

443
00:18:50,517 --> 00:18:52,551
Sorry.

444
00:18:52,553 --> 00:18:55,487
Joan said you were coming;
I... I forgot.

445
00:18:55,489 --> 00:18:57,122
It's not how
I wanted to meet you.

446
00:18:57,124 --> 00:18:58,891
She said you can tell
a lot about people

447
00:18:58,893 --> 00:19:00,192
just by looking at them.

448
00:19:00,194 --> 00:19:02,261
I swear, I...
usually wear pants.

449
00:19:02,263 --> 00:19:03,729
Well, in my experience,
most people

450
00:19:03,731 --> 00:19:05,264
need only be concerned
I won't notice

451
00:19:05,266 --> 00:19:06,498
anything worth remarking upon.

452
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:10,535
Watson seems adequately sexed.

453
00:19:11,939 --> 00:19:13,672
Hey.

454
00:19:13,674 --> 00:19:15,674
I was just introducing myself.

455
00:19:17,945 --> 00:19:20,379
I've got that thing.
I'll see you tonight.

456
00:19:20,381 --> 00:19:21,580
Okay.

457
00:19:27,855 --> 00:19:30,188
Your home, Watson...

458
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,823
it's utterly pleasant.

459
00:19:31,825 --> 00:19:33,692
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

460
00:19:33,694 --> 00:19:35,394
When you told me
you wanted a life of your own,

461
00:19:35,396 --> 00:19:36,595
I didn't realize
that you meant you wanted

462
00:19:36,597 --> 00:19:38,030
the same life everyone else has.

463
00:19:38,032 --> 00:19:39,464
But at any rate,
none of my business, is it?

464
00:19:39,466 --> 00:19:41,233
It's not.
And I didn't ask you here

465
00:19:41,235 --> 00:19:42,634
to talk about my apartment.

466
00:19:42,636 --> 00:19:44,970
No, you asked me here
to discuss Kitty.

467
00:19:44,972 --> 00:19:46,471
If she were not
the topic of conversation,

468
00:19:46,473 --> 00:19:48,941
then you wouldn't have
invited me to your home,

469
00:19:48,943 --> 00:19:50,776
where there's no chance
she'll be present.

470
00:19:52,346 --> 00:19:53,946
She disappointed you
in some way.

471
00:19:53,948 --> 00:19:55,247
Skills not up to snuff?

472
00:19:55,249 --> 00:19:57,316
Please remember
she is a novice.

473
00:19:57,318 --> 00:19:58,850
Actually, she did a great job.

474
00:19:58,852 --> 00:20:00,285
But I have some concerns.

475
00:20:00,287 --> 00:20:01,954
I thought we could
talk about them.

476
00:20:03,757 --> 00:20:04,923
You think that
Kitty needs help

477
00:20:04,925 --> 00:20:06,091
above and beyond
my mentorship.

478
00:20:06,093 --> 00:20:07,392
You read the same
file I did.

479
00:20:07,394 --> 00:20:08,894
She's a rape victim.

480
00:20:08,896 --> 00:20:11,296
She was kept and tortured.

481
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,899
Mm.

482
00:20:16,136 --> 00:20:19,171
You know me, so surely you know

483
00:20:19,173 --> 00:20:22,874
I've broached the subject of
a support group meeting before.

484
00:20:22,876 --> 00:20:25,010
Even offered
to pay for therapy.

485
00:20:25,012 --> 00:20:26,812
She's not interested, I know.

486
00:20:26,814 --> 00:20:28,447
Just as you also know

487
00:20:28,449 --> 00:20:30,749
someone with a problem
can't be forced to get help.

488
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:32,551
They have to want it.

489
00:20:32,553 --> 00:20:34,786
What Kitty wants
is to be a detective.

490
00:20:36,523 --> 00:20:38,490
I am taking pains
to try and channel

491
00:20:38,492 --> 00:20:40,592
her residual feelings
into her work.

492
00:20:42,329 --> 00:20:44,463
Well, that works out
great for you.

493
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:48,400
You told me that
you took on a partner

494
00:20:48,402 --> 00:20:50,635
because you wanted to replicate
what you and I had.

495
00:20:50,637 --> 00:20:52,637
That you thought it helped
with your recovery.

496
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:54,539
You think I would
try and take advantage

497
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,208
of the victim of a trauma?

498
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,910
Of course not, but there is
a conflict of interest here.

499
00:20:58,912 --> 00:21:02,447
She needs what she needs,
but you need what you need, too.

500
00:21:06,053 --> 00:21:10,055
It's-it's good that you're
in her life now, Watson.

501
00:21:10,057 --> 00:21:12,524
I mean,
it's commonly believed that, um,

502
00:21:12,526 --> 00:21:16,228
a child benefits mostly from
the presence of two parents.

503
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,164
He-- or she, in this case--
can absorb certain qualities

504
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,466
from the father--
clear-eyed view of the world,

505
00:21:21,468 --> 00:21:23,168
capacity of
rational thought, etcetera.

506
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,170
They can also absorb certain
qualities from the mother.

507
00:21:25,172 --> 00:21:27,105
Excuse me, but I am not
Kitty's mother,

508
00:21:27,107 --> 00:21:28,807
and she sure as hell
is not our child.

509
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:30,942
You brought her here;
she looks up to you.

510
00:21:30,944 --> 00:21:32,944
She says that she doesn't
need help-- fine--

511
00:21:32,946 --> 00:21:34,579
but you know better.

512
00:21:34,581 --> 00:21:37,082
And you're gonna have to be
the one that tells her.

513
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,620
It's Harlan.

514
00:21:41,622 --> 00:21:44,523
Making progress with the maths.

515
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,660
We thought
that Byron and Ike

516
00:21:48,662 --> 00:21:50,462
arrived at Portal Ten
simultaneously.

517
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,664
That would've meant that they
were doing all the same math

518
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,032
at essentially
the same time.

519
00:21:54,034 --> 00:21:56,001
Only, the math
you found at Byron's place

520
00:21:56,003 --> 00:21:57,003
says that's wrong.

521
00:21:57,004 --> 00:21:58,470
He was one step behind Ike.

522
00:21:58,472 --> 00:22:00,705
Are you proposing he did
not kill Mr. Walaczek?

523
00:22:00,707 --> 00:22:03,175
I don't know, but that's
not the weirdest part.

524
00:22:03,177 --> 00:22:04,810
Byron was obsessive.

525
00:22:04,812 --> 00:22:06,211
He time-stamped
almost everything he did.

526
00:22:06,213 --> 00:22:09,047
He only solved
the Portal Nine problem,

527
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:11,316
the same problem that sent me
to that old factory last night.

528
00:22:11,318 --> 00:22:12,884
But get this--

529
00:22:12,886 --> 00:22:14,686
he wasn't given
the same problem as me.

530
00:22:14,688 --> 00:22:16,655
And so it would've yielded
GPS coordinates

531
00:22:16,657 --> 00:22:18,323
for an entirely
different location.

532
00:22:18,325 --> 00:22:21,760
The person in charge of
the game changed the clue

533
00:22:21,762 --> 00:22:23,328
after the police
found Ike's body.

534
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:25,964
Well, he had to, right?

535
00:22:25,966 --> 00:22:27,899
If he hadn't, he would be
sending other competitors

536
00:22:27,901 --> 00:22:29,101
to an active crime scene.

537
00:22:29,103 --> 00:22:30,402
The important thing is

538
00:22:30,404 --> 00:22:31,536
I figured out the coordinates

539
00:22:31,538 --> 00:22:32,771
to the second location.

540
00:22:32,773 --> 00:22:35,540
I know where Byron went.

541
00:22:35,542 --> 00:22:36,842
What are you doing?

542
00:22:36,844 --> 00:22:38,410
You're saying he
time-stamped everything.

543
00:22:38,412 --> 00:22:40,345
I'm looking at the time
he received his clues.

544
00:22:40,347 --> 00:22:42,647
It's all there, to the second,
but what does that have to do...

545
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:44,149
What if you hadn't
found a body?

546
00:22:44,151 --> 00:22:46,118
If the game had
proceeded as planned,

547
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,486
what were you meant
to do there?

548
00:22:47,488 --> 00:22:49,354
I would have sent a text
to the phone number,

549
00:22:49,356 --> 00:22:51,523
the one that the killer painted
over, and then I would have

550
00:22:51,525 --> 00:22:52,891
gotten a message back
with the next problem.

551
00:22:52,893 --> 00:22:54,559
There's an extra
step in there.

552
00:22:54,561 --> 00:22:56,428
Why all this rigmarole with
phone numbers and texts?

553
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,064
Why not just post the problem
itself at the factory?

554
00:22:59,066 --> 00:23:02,100
I don't know, it's just the way
the game is played.

555
00:23:02,102 --> 00:23:04,102
They're for an old
industrial area in Queens.

556
00:23:04,104 --> 00:23:06,805
You're welcome
for finding your suspect.

557
00:23:06,807 --> 00:23:09,207
If I'm right, Harlan,
what you've found...

558
00:23:09,209 --> 00:23:11,109
is the site of
another murder.

559
00:23:11,111 --> 00:23:13,245
Byron Lowenthal's.

560
00:23:15,983 --> 00:23:18,216
You were right,
Lowenthal's dead.

561
00:23:18,218 --> 00:23:20,952
He was shot in the foot,
then the knee.

562
00:23:20,954 --> 00:23:22,821
Just like
Ike Wallaczek.

563
00:23:22,823 --> 00:23:26,391
I'm, uh, gonna look
over here now.

564
00:23:26,393 --> 00:23:29,427
Well, we think the perp
was pulling the body

565
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:31,429
to a car that was parked
over there.

566
00:23:31,431 --> 00:23:34,065
Then he just
left him here.

567
00:23:34,067 --> 00:23:35,901
Probably afraid
he'd been spotted.

568
00:23:35,903 --> 00:23:38,803
There's a lot
of homeless in the area.

569
00:23:41,441 --> 00:23:43,008
Question is:

570
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:45,010
how'd you know
Lowenthal was the next victim

571
00:23:45,012 --> 00:23:46,511
and not the killer?

572
00:23:49,316 --> 00:23:51,750
Well, that's
quite simple, really.

573
00:23:51,752 --> 00:23:54,352
The game is directing
its players to remote locales,

574
00:23:54,354 --> 00:23:56,788
and then instructing them
to send a text message

575
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,256
indicating their presence.

576
00:23:58,258 --> 00:24:00,125
I suspect the killer wanted
to remove the body

577
00:24:00,127 --> 00:24:02,928
so he could keep this new
location “in play,” so to speak.

578
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:05,130
Still missing the “simple” part.

579
00:24:05,132 --> 00:24:06,698
The late Mr. Lowenthal

580
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,366
received his final clue

581
00:24:08,368 --> 00:24:10,235
after Harlan discovered
Ike Wallaczek's body,

582
00:24:10,237 --> 00:24:12,737
but before news of the killing
had reached the media.

583
00:24:12,739 --> 00:24:14,439
That means the
game's designer

584
00:24:14,441 --> 00:24:16,408
knew the location
had been compromised.

585
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,577
And the only way
that he could have known that,

586
00:24:18,579 --> 00:24:20,111
at the time that he knew it,

587
00:24:20,113 --> 00:24:21,880
was if he, himself,
was the killer.

588
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,917
Belphegor's Prime is not
a treasure hunt.

589
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,619
It's a trap.

590
00:24:40,696 --> 00:24:42,196
Better?

591
00:24:42,198 --> 00:24:44,665
False alarm.

592
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:47,668
But I still feel
a little queasy.

593
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,273
This new dead guy--

594
00:24:52,275 --> 00:24:54,875
your friend said that he was
tortured, too, right?

595
00:24:54,877 --> 00:24:57,244
Right before the killer tried
to abscond with his corpse.

596
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:59,213
I assume
he intended to take

597
00:24:59,215 --> 00:25:02,383
Ike Wallaczek away with him
as well, only Ike was too large.

598
00:25:02,385 --> 00:25:04,685
A speedy mothballing
was the best he could do.

599
00:25:04,687 --> 00:25:07,221
So, just to recap,

600
00:25:07,223 --> 00:25:09,657
I've spent the last
few months of my life

601
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:13,360
playing a game that was
designed to kill me.

602
00:25:13,362 --> 00:25:15,629
Got to be a metaphor
in there somewhere, right?

603
00:25:15,631 --> 00:25:18,966
I think the word you're
looking for is “moral.”

604
00:25:18,968 --> 00:25:21,902
There is a moral in there:
games are for idiots.

605
00:25:24,707 --> 00:25:26,473
Breaking news from Ramapo.

606
00:25:26,475 --> 00:25:29,443
Kitty reports the Center for
Applied Mathematics and Logic

607
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,912
is not the sponsor
of Belphegor's Prime.

608
00:25:31,914 --> 00:25:34,148
Then it's got to be
a serial killer, right?

609
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,716
Someone who's obsessed
with mathematicians?

610
00:25:35,718 --> 00:25:37,284
Mm.

611
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,920
Perhaps he was bullied
by mathematicians as a child.

612
00:25:39,922 --> 00:25:42,056
Or mathematicians
killed his parents.

613
00:25:42,058 --> 00:25:43,657
I'm being serious.

614
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:45,726
Serial killers who devise
elaborate death traps

615
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,461
are the stuff of pulp fiction.

616
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:49,229
And besides, with respect
to these murders,

617
00:25:49,231 --> 00:25:51,165
there are none
of the elaborations

618
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:53,767
which mark that sort of culprit.

619
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:55,970
If anything, I would describe
the work as businesslike.

620
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:58,172
Then it's the government.

621
00:25:58,174 --> 00:26:01,241
I mean, the-the game was some
sort of test to weed out people

622
00:26:01,243 --> 00:26:03,243
who could weaponize math.

623
00:26:03,245 --> 00:26:05,179
The American intelligence
apparatus may be clod-like,

624
00:26:05,181 --> 00:26:07,014
but I think they would
do a better job

625
00:26:07,016 --> 00:26:08,749
of disposing of two bodies,
don't you?

626
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:11,785
Watson?

627
00:26:11,787 --> 00:26:13,621
I just heard
from one of the suspects

628
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:14,922
Marcus and I talked to
yesterday,

629
00:26:14,924 --> 00:26:16,290
another puzzle-hunter.

630
00:26:16,292 --> 00:26:18,525
Tell me he confessed
to the murders.

631
00:26:18,527 --> 00:26:20,427
We ruled him out right away,
but he heard about

632
00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:22,329
Byron Lowenthal's murder on
the news and wanted me to know

633
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:25,165
he's at a friend's place,
some guy named Paul.

634
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,934
That is fascinating.

635
00:26:26,936 --> 00:26:28,369
Actually, it might be.

636
00:26:28,371 --> 00:26:31,038
Paul is positive he knows
who the killer is.

637
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,807
I know the guards
are a bit much,

638
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:35,509
but I wanted everyone
to feel safe.

639
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:38,178
And, besides,
math has been good to me.

640
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,279
Commodities.

641
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:40,848
So, you and your friends,

642
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:43,150
you were competitors
in Belphegor's Prime?

643
00:26:43,152 --> 00:26:45,352
Most of us. Some of the others
are just here for the math.

644
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,121
You said you could
identify the killer.

645
00:26:47,123 --> 00:26:49,323
I can, sort of.

646
00:26:52,061 --> 00:26:54,194
“Mo Shellshocker.”

647
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:56,930
It's a pseudonym,
obviously, but I'm telling you,

648
00:26:56,932 --> 00:26:58,365
this is the guy
you're looking for.

649
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,600
I've heard of him.

650
00:26:59,602 --> 00:27:01,335
He uses his blog
to expose bad math.

651
00:27:01,337 --> 00:27:03,837
Corrupt economists, biased
pollsters, that sort of thing.

652
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:05,572
He's actually
sort of a crusader.

653
00:27:05,574 --> 00:27:06,574
He's a murderer.

654
00:27:06,575 --> 00:27:09,143
How can you be
so sure?

655
00:27:09,145 --> 00:27:10,744
When he isn't crusading,
he's competing in puzzle hunts.

656
00:27:10,746 --> 00:27:11,812
A few months ago,

657
00:27:11,814 --> 00:27:13,080
he claimed to
have solved

658
00:27:13,082 --> 00:27:14,815
Cicada 3301 two
years in a row.

659
00:27:14,817 --> 00:27:17,484
Some people called BS,
including...

660
00:27:17,486 --> 00:27:20,120
Ike Wallaczek
and Byron Lowenthal.

661
00:27:20,122 --> 00:27:21,221
“WallaCheckYourMath,”

662
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:22,489
“ByLow2020.”

663
00:27:22,491 --> 00:27:23,757
Those are their
online handles.

664
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:25,392
Their friends
will confirm it.

665
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,528
A flame war does not
a murderer make.

666
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:30,097
The stuff these guys were
slinging at each other was ugly.

667
00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:32,099
Mo knew they were into hunts,
and so he built one

668
00:27:32,101 --> 00:27:34,034
that would send them to places
where he could kill them.

669
00:27:34,036 --> 00:27:35,469
That's what we're
doing here is

670
00:27:35,471 --> 00:27:36,837
we're just sifting
through all the math

671
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:38,338
he's posted on his blog
over the years,

672
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,840
to see if we could
find his signature

673
00:27:39,842 --> 00:27:41,975
or something that
could identify him.

674
00:27:41,977 --> 00:27:45,279
If two people weren't dead,
we'd probably be having fun.

675
00:27:45,281 --> 00:27:46,747
But still, the
chances that he left

676
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:48,582
something like that
in his math...

677
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,784
If it's there, we'll find it.
In the meantime,

678
00:27:50,786 --> 00:27:52,186
we thought the
police should know

679
00:27:52,188 --> 00:27:53,687
who they're really
dealing with.

680
00:27:53,689 --> 00:27:55,389
<i>I've got to go meet someone</i>

681
00:27:55,391 --> 00:27:56,924
about my other case.

682
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:59,927
You're good to pass all this
along to Marcus? Okay.

683
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:03,030
I must say, I'm surprised you
didn't offer to stay and help.

684
00:28:03,032 --> 00:28:05,265
Mr. Ettinger makes
a compelling case with respect

685
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,067
to Mo Shellshocker's
viability as a suspect.

686
00:28:07,069 --> 00:28:09,002
Mo is a genius.

687
00:28:09,004 --> 00:28:10,637
We're talking off the charts.

688
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:12,139
Leibniz meets Euler meets Gauss.

689
00:28:12,141 --> 00:28:14,108
Huh.
He may have an ego,

690
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,110
but he's not gonna kill
anyone over a few comments.

691
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:18,312
So, while “The League of
Concerned Mathematician”"

692
00:28:18,314 --> 00:28:21,014
chases its tail up there, I
am gonna do the smart thing

693
00:28:21,016 --> 00:28:22,416
and get out of town.

694
00:28:22,418 --> 00:28:24,485
You can let me know
when it all blows over.

695
00:28:24,487 --> 00:28:26,386
You're not going
anywhere, Harlan.

696
00:28:26,388 --> 00:28:29,223
Or should I call you
Mo Shellshocker?

697
00:28:32,728 --> 00:28:34,661
Did you honestly think
I wouldn't recognize

698
00:28:34,663 --> 00:28:36,130
an anagram of my own name?

699
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:40,567
I knew I should've gone
with “Choker Hell Moss”"

700
00:28:40,569 --> 00:28:42,569
But I never thought
that you would see it, okay?

701
00:28:42,571 --> 00:28:44,104
Math is my thing, not yours.

702
00:28:44,106 --> 00:28:46,473
It's my name, Harlan;
that makes it my thing.

703
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,675
It was an homage.

704
00:28:48,677 --> 00:28:50,043
Explain.

705
00:28:50,045 --> 00:28:52,045
Every day, all over the world,

706
00:28:52,047 --> 00:28:54,348
math is used to trick people.

707
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,917
Data dredging to sell
pharmaceuticals.

708
00:28:56,919 --> 00:28:59,720
Publication bias
to justify wars.

709
00:28:59,722 --> 00:29:02,322
In the wrong hands, math can be
manipulated, abused.

710
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:05,425
And I decided to do
something about it.

711
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:09,596
You catch people
who murder other people.

712
00:29:09,598 --> 00:29:11,431
I catch people who murder math.

713
00:29:11,433 --> 00:29:14,568
According to this,
Mo is a wanted man.

714
00:29:17,606 --> 00:29:19,940
Harlan?

715
00:29:19,942 --> 00:29:23,110
The D.O.D. was working
on a new fighter.

716
00:29:23,112 --> 00:29:27,047
Only, I knew that the
performance stats were bogus.

717
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:29,116
A friend of mine found
the internal numbers,

718
00:29:29,118 --> 00:29:31,251
and I sort of published them.

719
00:29:31,253 --> 00:29:33,320
So you put classified
Department of Defense documents

720
00:29:33,322 --> 00:29:34,888
on the Internet.

721
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:36,623
Isn't that what
you would have done?

722
00:29:38,928 --> 00:29:41,562
Fine! I screwed up, okay?

723
00:29:41,564 --> 00:29:43,730
But, hey, that's what I do,
right? I screw up.

724
00:29:43,732 --> 00:29:46,233
If I didn't, then probably you
wouldn't have secretly fired me.

725
00:29:46,235 --> 00:29:47,968
Excuse me?

726
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,403
I know about Indira Patel!

727
00:29:51,006 --> 00:29:53,340
I know you replaced me.

728
00:29:55,144 --> 00:29:58,979
Kitty, I think
we could use some tea.

729
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:04,318
Just tell me.

730
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,253
Tell me what math I got wrong.

731
00:30:06,255 --> 00:30:09,356
Tell me why you didn't let me
make it up to you.

732
00:30:09,358 --> 00:30:12,926
It wasn't the maths, it was you.

733
00:30:14,763 --> 00:30:18,232
Your work was impeccable.

734
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:20,334
And for the most part,
I enjoyed our collaborations.

735
00:30:20,336 --> 00:30:24,838
B-But over time, you just...
you became quite... needy.

736
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,406
What are you talking about?

737
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:29,109
Y-You asked my advice
on-on social matters,

738
00:30:29,111 --> 00:30:32,512
and you even invited me
to a party.

739
00:30:32,514 --> 00:30:34,648
You were my friend.

740
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,416
I was your employer, Harlan.

741
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:37,918
A-And you were my consultant.

742
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,419
One of many.

743
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:43,757
I know that I'm a little
obsessed with what I do.

744
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:46,960
That has always made it hard
to make friends.

745
00:30:46,962 --> 00:30:50,664
And I used to feel pretty bad
about that, and then I met you.

746
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:52,566
And I thought to myself,

747
00:30:52,568 --> 00:30:55,903
hey, if it doesn't bother him,
why should I let it bother me?

748
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:03,810
I got a lot
out of the work that we did.

749
00:31:03,812 --> 00:31:06,146
A lot.

750
00:31:06,148 --> 00:31:11,218
But if someone like you thinks
that I'm a loser, then...

751
00:31:22,564 --> 00:31:24,965
Hey, are we still doing this?

752
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:26,366
Doing what?

753
00:31:26,368 --> 00:31:28,502
Talking about the case.

754
00:31:28,504 --> 00:31:30,070
You're just sitting there.

755
00:31:30,072 --> 00:31:32,105
I'm thinking.

756
00:31:32,107 --> 00:31:34,308
I suspect the silence
is exacerbated

757
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,143
by the nature
of our communication.

758
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:37,811
Yes. Well, I don't
live there anymore.

759
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,713
So, if you want
to talk shop at night,

760
00:31:39,715 --> 00:31:41,515
this is the best I can do.

761
00:31:41,517 --> 00:31:45,252
Keep asking myself:
what did the killer want?

762
00:31:45,254 --> 00:31:48,255
He went to great lengths to lure
brilliant mathematicians

763
00:31:48,257 --> 00:31:49,489
to their deaths.

764
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,525
Winnowed out
the less gifted

765
00:31:51,527 --> 00:31:54,061
by making his problems
more and more complicated.

766
00:31:54,063 --> 00:31:57,597
He had a type, but I still think
he's a serial killer

767
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:59,266
only in the most
technical sense.

768
00:31:59,268 --> 00:32:01,201
He tortured both his victims.

769
00:32:01,203 --> 00:32:02,936
But there's no sign
that he enjoyed it.

770
00:32:02,938 --> 00:32:04,538
The work was
utilitarian,

771
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,740
suggesting it was
less for pleasure

772
00:32:06,742 --> 00:32:10,043
and more for persuasion.

773
00:32:10,045 --> 00:32:11,945
He wanted something.

774
00:32:11,947 --> 00:32:13,714
But what?

775
00:32:13,716 --> 00:32:16,483
Maybe there's a connection
between Wallaczek and Lowenthal

776
00:32:16,485 --> 00:32:18,418
we haven't spotted yet.

777
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,220
Maybe they were working
on a project together,

778
00:32:20,222 --> 00:32:21,822
something that was worth
a lot of money.

779
00:32:21,824 --> 00:32:23,857
There's no way the killer
could have predicted

780
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:26,093
which competitors would make it
to the terminal stage.

781
00:32:26,095 --> 00:32:28,795
That part of the game
was beyond his control.

782
00:32:28,797 --> 00:32:30,664
If it weren't,
he would've been prepared

783
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:33,300
to dispose of a body
the size of Ike Wallaczek's.

784
00:32:33,302 --> 00:32:35,335
So, even if there were a
connection between the victims,

785
00:32:35,337 --> 00:32:37,070
the killer could not
have counted on them

786
00:32:37,072 --> 00:32:38,839
being lured into his trap.

787
00:32:38,841 --> 00:32:41,041
Certainly not
in sequence.

788
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:45,112
His game was, in many respects,
one of chance.

789
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:51,718
Suggesting he knows what
he wants, but not who has it.

790
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,888
Like he was on a puzzle hunt
of his own.

791
00:32:56,825 --> 00:32:58,859
I'm back.

792
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:05,665
I'll set up
downstairs, yeah?

793
00:33:09,138 --> 00:33:11,238
I've been thinking about
what you said earlier.

794
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,740
I've decided to engage her
one more time

795
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:15,609
with regards
to her recuperation.

796
00:33:17,112 --> 00:33:21,815
I doubt she'll listen,
but I'll keep you apprised.

797
00:33:25,954 --> 00:33:27,421
I've been thinking.

798
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:29,623
About?
You. Your history.

799
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:31,825
Your decision
not to seek help.

800
00:33:31,827 --> 00:33:34,594
I think it's
a mistake.

801
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,530
Oh?

802
00:33:36,532 --> 00:33:38,198
I've looked into a number
of support groups.

803
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,633
As you are well aware,

804
00:33:39,635 --> 00:33:41,701
I have benefited greatly
from similar settings.

805
00:33:41,703 --> 00:33:43,270
You have.

806
00:33:43,272 --> 00:33:44,638
The process, I find,

807
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,906
is not unlike
voiding one's bowels...

808
00:33:45,908 --> 00:33:47,808
I'll go.
What?

809
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:49,676
I'll go.
Just get me the details.

810
00:33:52,014 --> 00:33:55,182
I've been thinking, too-- about
your number-cruncher, Harlan.

811
00:33:55,184 --> 00:33:57,017
You think I was
too hard on him.

812
00:33:57,019 --> 00:33:58,685
You will have consultants
of your own one day.

813
00:33:58,687 --> 00:34:01,488
You'll see that they require
management and focus.

814
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:04,124
They are but keys on a keyboard,
and we're the typists.

815
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:06,159
You could've given him
a shoeing for all I care.

816
00:34:06,161 --> 00:34:07,828
No, I'm just saying that

817
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:10,030
some of the stuff he's got
up to, it's quite good.

818
00:34:10,032 --> 00:34:11,698
You should take a look.

819
00:34:13,368 --> 00:34:15,735
You may find a fellow typist.

820
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,076
Hello?

821
00:34:23,078 --> 00:34:25,312
Yeah, I
hear that you and some friends

822
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:27,848
are trying to identify
Mo Shellshocker.

823
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,649
That's right. Who is this?

824
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:32,719
His name is Harlan Emple.

825
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:34,020
You got a pen?

826
00:34:34,022 --> 00:34:36,456
I'll-I'll give you his address.

827
00:34:52,454 --> 00:34:54,020
Harlan.

828
00:34:54,022 --> 00:34:56,356
You can't take a hint, can you?

829
00:34:56,358 --> 00:34:57,657
I got your text messages.

830
00:34:57,659 --> 00:34:58,958
I don't want to see you
right now.

831
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,827
So if you came here
to apologize...

832
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:03,363
Actually, I came here
to spare you an agonizing death.

833
00:35:04,299 --> 00:35:05,832
Can I come in?

834
00:35:05,834 --> 00:35:08,301
I was puzzling earlier

835
00:35:08,303 --> 00:35:12,038
as to why the killer went
to such specific lengths.

836
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,606
What did he want?

837
00:35:13,608 --> 00:35:15,809
And then Watson,
quite by accident,

838
00:35:15,811 --> 00:35:17,410
she made a most
compelling analogy.

839
00:35:17,412 --> 00:35:20,080
She said it was as if he
was on a hunt of his own.

840
00:35:20,082 --> 00:35:22,615
Duh. He was hunting
mathematicians.

841
00:35:22,617 --> 00:35:23,783
No, he wasn't.

842
00:35:23,785 --> 00:35:25,151
He was hunting<i> a</i> mathematician.

843
00:35:25,153 --> 00:35:26,619
One.

844
00:35:26,621 --> 00:35:29,389
A man who had concealed
his identity not only

845
00:35:29,391 --> 00:35:31,191
from the mathematics
community at large,

846
00:35:31,193 --> 00:35:32,859
but also from the FBI.

847
00:35:32,861 --> 00:35:35,395
A “crusader,”
you might call him.

848
00:35:35,397 --> 00:35:36,763
Wait a minute.

849
00:35:36,765 --> 00:35:38,731
Are you saying that
this was all about me?

850
00:35:53,448 --> 00:35:56,449
<i> Unfortunately, emulating</i>
<i>the work of people like me</i>

851
00:35:56,451 --> 00:35:59,018
<i>is not without risks.</i>

852
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,320
Creates enemies.

853
00:36:00,322 --> 00:36:02,889
I knew it was the government.

854
00:36:02,891 --> 00:36:04,424
It was a lottery winner.

855
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,260
Little over a year ago,

856
00:36:07,262 --> 00:36:09,529
you started a series of blogs
where you exposed the flaws

857
00:36:09,531 --> 00:36:11,664
in certain scratch card
lottery games.

858
00:36:11,666 --> 00:36:13,766
Tickets like this one.

859
00:36:13,768 --> 00:36:15,802
I wrote about
baited hook games.

860
00:36:15,804 --> 00:36:17,971
Games where the numbers
are printed on the front.

861
00:36:17,973 --> 00:36:20,707
Scratch off the hidden numbers,
hope for a match.

862
00:36:20,709 --> 00:36:23,309
Only, you proved that with
careful mathematical analysis

863
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:25,512
of the visible numbers,
you could predict

864
00:36:25,514 --> 00:36:28,381
which tickets were winners
80% of the time.

865
00:36:28,383 --> 00:36:29,682
If you had exploited

866
00:36:29,684 --> 00:36:32,085
this flaw,
rather than exposing it,

867
00:36:32,087 --> 00:36:33,520
you could have made millions.

868
00:36:33,522 --> 00:36:36,022
Well... sure.
But that would been cheating.

869
00:36:36,024 --> 00:36:37,157
Right.

870
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:38,825
So imagine
for a moment

871
00:36:38,827 --> 00:36:41,060
that you are a less
honest mathematician.

872
00:36:41,062 --> 00:36:42,495
Right?

873
00:36:42,497 --> 00:36:44,063
You've been taking
advantage of these games

874
00:36:44,065 --> 00:36:47,967
for a couple of years to
amass a small fortune.

875
00:36:47,969 --> 00:36:49,502
And then “Mo"
comes along.

876
00:36:49,504 --> 00:36:51,971
He starts exposing
the broken games.

877
00:36:51,973 --> 00:36:54,340
State lottery commissions
shut them down.

878
00:36:54,342 --> 00:36:56,976
The exploitable
games dry up.

879
00:36:56,978 --> 00:37:00,613
Now, if you were a
psychopathic lottery cheat,

880
00:37:00,615 --> 00:37:02,582
how do you fix that?

881
00:37:02,584 --> 00:37:04,484
You kill Mo.

882
00:37:04,486 --> 00:37:07,253
<i>Unfortunately, Mo is elusive.</i>

883
00:37:07,255 --> 00:37:08,821
<i>Anonymous.</i>

884
00:37:08,823 --> 00:37:11,224
The only thing
he knew about him for sure

885
00:37:11,226 --> 00:37:14,394
was that he could not resist
a puzzle hunt.

886
00:37:14,396 --> 00:37:17,130
Now, if you were smart enough
to identify

887
00:37:17,132 --> 00:37:19,399
and take advantage of
broken lottery games...

888
00:37:19,401 --> 00:37:21,868
Then I'm smart enough
to design a puzzle hunt.

889
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:25,338
This plan was not
without its flaws.

890
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:28,775
Once a competitor
reached the terminal stage,

891
00:37:28,777 --> 00:37:32,745
the killer could not be certain
that he'd trapped Mo, could he?

892
00:37:32,747 --> 00:37:34,480
So he tortured them.

893
00:37:34,482 --> 00:37:37,083
I submit he forced them to
log on to Mo's Web site,

894
00:37:37,085 --> 00:37:39,686
and when they failed...

895
00:37:41,323 --> 00:37:42,755
After two murders,

896
00:37:42,757 --> 00:37:44,290
the game was compromised.

897
00:37:44,292 --> 00:37:46,192
So the killer devises
a Plan “B.”

898
00:37:46,194 --> 00:37:47,460
He tricks

899
00:37:47,462 --> 00:37:49,229
a group of his peers

900
00:37:49,231 --> 00:37:51,097
into helping search
for an alternative means

901
00:37:51,099 --> 00:37:53,032
of identifying Mo.

902
00:37:56,504 --> 00:37:58,438
You're talking about that guy.

903
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,906
The one with the penthouse.

904
00:37:59,908 --> 00:38:02,742
<i>Paul?</i>

905
00:38:02,744 --> 00:38:05,044
Lottery winners
are public record.

906
00:38:05,046 --> 00:38:07,814
So when I searched for
the names of repeat winners

907
00:38:07,816 --> 00:38:09,482
in the dates prior
to your posts...

908
00:38:09,484 --> 00:38:11,317
I can't believe
I drank his water.

909
00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:12,685
I called him.

910
00:38:12,687 --> 00:38:14,654
I identified you as Mo.

911
00:38:14,656 --> 00:38:16,122
And I gave him your address.

912
00:38:16,124 --> 00:38:17,590
You what?!

913
00:38:21,129 --> 00:38:23,062
Drop your weapon!

914
00:38:23,064 --> 00:38:24,597
<i>I did not, however, give him</i>

915
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:25,965
<i>the correct apartment number.</i>

916
00:38:25,967 --> 00:38:28,334
He was arrested
a little over an hour ago.

917
00:38:30,739 --> 00:38:31,871
Tried to call you to
tell you, but, um...

918
00:38:31,873 --> 00:38:33,539
But I was ignoring you.

919
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:35,008
Yes, you were ignoring me.

920
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,209
Look, you know

921
00:38:36,211 --> 00:38:37,377
that I'm still screwed, right?

922
00:38:37,379 --> 00:38:39,279
You told him that I'm Mo.

923
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:42,115
He's gonna tell the police,
they're gonna tell the FBI...

924
00:38:42,117 --> 00:38:43,516
The NYPD is under
the impression

925
00:38:43,518 --> 00:38:45,385
that I lied about
your connection to Mo

926
00:38:45,387 --> 00:38:47,920
in order to draw
Mr. Ettinger out.

927
00:38:47,922 --> 00:38:49,555
As far as the
FBI goes, well,

928
00:38:49,557 --> 00:38:51,958
I've got some associates
who have created a trail

929
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,860
which will
strongly suggest that Mo

930
00:38:53,862 --> 00:38:55,728
is a cyber-terrorist
I became aware of

931
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:58,197
whilst working for, um...

932
00:38:58,199 --> 00:38:59,766
queen and country.

933
00:38:59,768 --> 00:39:02,135
Your secret's
quite safe.

934
00:39:02,137 --> 00:39:03,903
Thanks.

935
00:39:06,508 --> 00:39:09,776
My reasons for preserving you
are entirely selfish, Harlan.

936
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:13,279
You are a tremendous asset.

937
00:39:13,281 --> 00:39:15,815
I have little doubt

938
00:39:15,817 --> 00:39:19,118
I will need your help again
in the future.

939
00:39:26,461 --> 00:39:28,528
Me or him?

940
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:29,996
You.

941
00:39:29,998 --> 00:39:31,798
I have an update on
that real estate flipper.

942
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,433
I thought you might
want to know.

943
00:39:39,274 --> 00:39:41,908
I tracked down the truck rental
receipts to get her name.

944
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,142
Valerie Cork.

945
00:39:43,144 --> 00:39:44,911
She's an art authenticator.

946
00:39:44,913 --> 00:39:46,779
And that crate you saw?

947
00:39:46,781 --> 00:39:48,414
There was
something called

948
00:39:48,416 --> 00:39:50,683
a scanning fluorescence
spectrometry machine inside.

949
00:39:50,685 --> 00:39:52,251
They're used...
To find paintings

950
00:39:52,253 --> 00:39:53,553
underneath other paintings.

951
00:39:53,555 --> 00:39:55,288
So it turns out
that the building

952
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:56,689
Chad Keswick was looking to buy

953
00:39:56,691 --> 00:39:59,025
was leased by the WPA
during the Depression.

954
00:39:59,027 --> 00:40:00,927
They commissioned a
mural for the lobby.

955
00:40:00,929 --> 00:40:03,329
The artist was a
notorious communist,

956
00:40:03,331 --> 00:40:05,365
so when the property passed
into private hands in the '50s,

957
00:40:05,367 --> 00:40:06,999
the new owners
had it painted over.

958
00:40:07,001 --> 00:40:08,735
But it was still there,
under the paint.

959
00:40:08,737 --> 00:40:11,037
A lost work by Diego Rivera.

960
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:13,473
It's worth ten times
the price of the building.

961
00:40:14,676 --> 00:40:17,043
I was hoping to leak
the truth to the<i> Times.</i>

962
00:40:18,113 --> 00:40:20,046
I promised you a cut of my fee.

963
00:40:20,048 --> 00:40:22,148
But I'm pretty sure
the mural's gonna end up

964
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:24,384
in the hands of
a historical trust.

965
00:40:24,386 --> 00:40:26,352
I'd feel obligated
to refund my client,

966
00:40:26,354 --> 00:40:28,388
which means you'd get
a cut of nothing.

967
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:31,457
That works for me.

968
00:40:31,459 --> 00:40:33,493
Okay.

969
00:40:35,463 --> 00:40:37,397
I think you should know

970
00:40:37,399 --> 00:40:39,732
that I am going
to a meeting tonight.

971
00:40:41,803 --> 00:40:45,505
One of those
support groups for...

972
00:40:45,507 --> 00:40:47,340
people like me.

973
00:40:47,342 --> 00:40:49,876
It was, uh, Sherlock's idea.

974
00:40:49,878 --> 00:40:51,644
That's great.

975
00:40:51,646 --> 00:40:53,446
I know you put him up to it.

976
00:40:53,448 --> 00:40:55,381
We talked.

977
00:40:57,552 --> 00:41:00,219
When he first approached me
in London,

978
00:41:00,221 --> 00:41:03,556
I was...

979
00:41:03,558 --> 00:41:05,558
in a bad way.

980
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,227
And I had been for a while.

981
00:41:08,229 --> 00:41:11,130
But then,
when he talked about

982
00:41:11,132 --> 00:41:12,365
the work that he did,

983
00:41:12,367 --> 00:41:16,035
about the things
that he saw in me...

984
00:41:18,406 --> 00:41:19,739
I want it.

985
00:41:19,741 --> 00:41:21,874
I want every bit
of what's he offered me,

986
00:41:21,876 --> 00:41:23,843
of what he offered you, but...

987
00:41:23,845 --> 00:41:26,212
if I've learned one thing
over the last few weeks,

988
00:41:26,214 --> 00:41:28,047
it's that he can't pull it off.

989
00:41:28,049 --> 00:41:29,682
Not by himself, anyway.

990
00:41:31,586 --> 00:41:34,153
And if I'm gonna get
what I want,

991
00:41:34,155 --> 00:41:37,690
then I'm going to need
your help, too.

992
00:41:40,361 --> 00:41:42,829
I still think
the meetings are bollocks,

993
00:41:42,831 --> 00:41:44,931
but you say they're important.

994
00:41:44,933 --> 00:41:47,967
They matter to you, so...

995
00:41:47,969 --> 00:41:49,735
What do you say, Watson?

996
00:41:49,737 --> 00:41:52,071
Will you help me?

997
00:41:56,277 --> 00:41:58,244
I don't know how it happened.

998
00:41:58,246 --> 00:42:01,547
It just... hit me.

999
00:42:01,549 --> 00:42:03,983
Like a truck, out of nowhere.

1000
00:42:04,853 --> 00:42:07,753
Work is good.

1001
00:42:07,755 --> 00:42:09,755
I have friends.

1002
00:42:09,757 --> 00:42:13,092
I'm in a
relationship.

1003
00:42:13,094 --> 00:42:16,896
Somewhere along
the way, somehow,

1004
00:42:16,898 --> 00:42:19,732
I stopped being a victim

1005
00:42:19,734 --> 00:42:22,602
and became a survivor.

1006
00:42:22,604 --> 00:42:25,705
So, I guess all I'm saying is,
there's hope.

1007
00:42:26,357 --> 00:42:31,686
Do the work. Love yourself.
There's hope.

<i>Previously on</i> Elementary...

2
00:00:03,422 --> 00:00:04,761
If you're looking for Sherlock,
he's downstairs.

3
00:00:04,785 --> 00:00:05,841
Okay.

4
00:00:05,842 --> 00:00:07,541
<i>His name is Harlan Emple.</i>

5
00:00:07,543 --> 00:00:09,176
<i>He is the Rachel P. Hanson</i>
<i>Professor</i>

6
00:00:09,178 --> 00:00:11,301
for Applied Mathematics
at Columbia University.

7
00:00:11,301 --> 00:00:14,502
What I don't get is
why he isn't wearing a shirt.

8
00:00:14,504 --> 00:00:17,372
He doesn't like anything to come
between him and the numbers.

9
00:00:17,374 --> 00:00:18,415
What is it?

10
00:00:18,438 --> 00:00:20,274
The answers to your questions
about Kitty.

11
00:00:20,276 --> 00:00:22,710
The truth is she was a
victim of a horrific crime.

12
00:00:22,712 --> 00:00:24,646
<i>After you left last night,</i>

13
00:00:24,648 --> 00:00:26,848
Sherlock gave me an envelope.

14
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,249
Sherlock keeps saying

15
00:00:28,251 --> 00:00:30,385
that I need to get
a better sense of you,

16
00:00:30,387 --> 00:00:33,021
and maybe that will give you
a better sense of me.

17
00:00:42,065 --> 00:00:43,065
It's open.

18
00:00:47,637 --> 00:00:49,003
It's nothing.

19
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:50,872
It's Sherlock and
one of his experts.

20
00:00:50,874 --> 00:00:52,006
Which one?

21
00:00:52,008 --> 00:00:53,241
Phillip something.

22
00:00:53,243 --> 00:00:54,575
Must be new.

23
00:00:54,577 --> 00:00:57,445
He's a knife-thrower.

24
00:00:57,447 --> 00:00:58,913
Why does Sherlock have
a knife-thrower?

25
00:00:58,915 --> 00:01:00,748
He got bored the other day,

26
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,185
started looking into this, uh,
circus accident from the '30s.

27
00:01:04,187 --> 00:01:07,922
The Great Galardo perforated one
of his assistants during an act,

28
00:01:07,924 --> 00:01:09,924
except Sherlock thinks
the blade was thrown

29
00:01:09,926 --> 00:01:11,492
by somebody in the stands,
not Galardo.

30
00:01:11,494 --> 00:01:15,096
Phillip, as far as I
can tell, disagrees.

31
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:18,900
It can't be done, okay?

32
00:01:18,902 --> 00:01:19,934
It was done.

33
00:01:19,936 --> 00:01:21,335
You're wrong.

34
00:01:21,337 --> 00:01:23,538
Nobody can chuck
a knife that far.

35
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,239
What's this?

36
00:01:25,241 --> 00:01:26,207
You're...

37
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:27,209
Not here.

38
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,509
I'm not here.

39
00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:29,711
Remember that, okay?

40
00:01:29,713 --> 00:01:31,279
Oh, yes. Heaven
forfend your work

41
00:01:31,281 --> 00:01:33,247
with me should endanger
your precious day job.

42
00:01:33,249 --> 00:01:35,116
You throw knives?

43
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,252
You know, it was supposed
to be just you here.

44
00:01:38,254 --> 00:01:41,355
Phillip is arguably the greatest
knife-thrower in the world.

45
00:01:41,357 --> 00:01:42,790
Has been for decades.

46
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:43,925
Only, there's little money

47
00:01:43,927 --> 00:01:45,193
to be made
in the impalement arts.

48
00:01:45,195 --> 00:01:46,494
So, as a youth, he turned

49
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,563
to what you Americans
term “football”"

50
00:01:48,565 --> 00:01:50,131
Is this a joke?

51
00:01:53,837 --> 00:01:55,002
Phillip, head
and heart.

52
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:56,904
Come on.
Head and heart.

53
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:06,814
Can I go?

54
00:02:06,816 --> 00:02:09,484
Yeah.

55
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,489
15 years he spent throwing
that misshapen ball around.

56
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:16,057
15 years.

57
00:02:16,059 --> 00:02:18,259
When I think of the acclaim
he could have brought

58
00:02:18,261 --> 00:02:20,828
to competitive blade slinging.

59
00:02:27,237 --> 00:02:29,036
You're following me,
Watson.

60
00:02:29,038 --> 00:02:30,338
I don't like it.

61
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,740
I want you to help
me with something.

62
00:02:32,742 --> 00:02:33,908
This is Chad Keswick.

63
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,976
He buys distressed
buildings,

64
00:02:34,978 --> 00:02:36,210
paints, spackles,

65
00:02:36,212 --> 00:02:37,645
and then flips them
for quick money.

66
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:39,180
Who'd he kill?
No one.

67
00:02:39,182 --> 00:02:41,315
I was hired by one of
his rivals to find out

68
00:02:41,317 --> 00:02:43,017
why he's been circling
this old office building

69
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:44,218
in Jamaica, Queens.

70
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,586
She wants to know
why he thinks

71
00:02:45,588 --> 00:02:47,355
the building is
a good investment.

72
00:02:47,357 --> 00:02:49,590
Is there a crime in there,
something worth investigating?

73
00:02:49,592 --> 00:02:50,925
Well, I've been
shadowing Keswick,

74
00:02:50,927 --> 00:02:52,593
but yesterday I think
he noticed me.

75
00:02:52,595 --> 00:02:54,595
I want to switch
up the tail.

76
00:02:54,597 --> 00:02:57,231
You followed me for over
a week before I noticed you.

77
00:02:57,233 --> 00:02:59,033
Help me out, and I'll
cut you in on my fee.

78
00:02:59,035 --> 00:03:02,003
I don't work for you,
I work for Sherlock.

79
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:03,437
I worked for him, too.

80
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,773
And, in my experience,
he was always supportive

81
00:03:05,775 --> 00:03:07,942
of taking on work
outside the partnership.

82
00:03:07,944 --> 00:03:10,912
Sorry, it's not my cup of tea.

83
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:33,034
Hello, Portal Ten.

84
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,247
I'm here, Belphegor.

85
00:03:46,249 --> 00:03:49,784
So where is the next clue?

Look, for the last time,
I was playing a game!

90
00:04:45,356 --> 00:04:47,456
Yeah, you called it
a puzzle hunt.

91
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,491
Belphegor's Prime.

92
00:04:50,761 --> 00:04:53,262
Think Cicada 3301
or Octorine's Challenge.

93
00:04:54,365 --> 00:04:55,631
They're math games.

94
00:04:55,633 --> 00:04:56,865
Math-- maybe you've heard of it.

95
00:04:56,867 --> 00:04:58,333
I've got some math for you.

96
00:04:58,335 --> 00:05:00,335
One dead guy
plus one live guy

97
00:05:00,337 --> 00:05:02,104
found in the same
deserted factory.

98
00:05:02,106 --> 00:05:06,108
I was not “found” there;
I am the one who called 911.

99
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,310
I was waiting there
for the police.

100
00:05:08,312 --> 00:05:09,745
Mr. Emple,

101
00:05:09,747 --> 00:05:11,613
we're just trying
to do our jobs, all right?

102
00:05:11,615 --> 00:05:13,048
First officers
on the scene described you

103
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,516
as “extremely agitated.”

104
00:05:14,518 --> 00:05:15,984
Well, of course
I was agitated.

105
00:05:15,986 --> 00:05:18,754
I had just found
a dead guy in mothballs!

106
00:05:18,756 --> 00:05:21,790
And did I mention that I have
not slept in almost two days?

107
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:23,358
Because of the math game.

108
00:05:24,762 --> 00:05:26,195
Can I borrow those?

109
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:31,100
This...

110
00:05:31,102 --> 00:05:33,302
is Belphegor's Prime, okay?

111
00:05:33,304 --> 00:05:35,304
It's a numeric palindrome.

112
00:05:35,306 --> 00:05:40,776
It's 666 bookended by 13 zeroes
and then bracketed with ones.

113
00:05:40,778 --> 00:05:43,846
Named for the demon Belphegor
who was a prince of hell.

114
00:05:43,848 --> 00:05:46,448
The first clue for the hunt
started making the rounds

115
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,883
a few months ago.

116
00:05:47,885 --> 00:05:49,651
It was a JPEG with two numbers
hidden in it.

117
00:05:49,653 --> 00:05:51,453
You divide those numbers
by Belphegor's Prime,

118
00:05:51,455 --> 00:05:54,890
and you get the GPS coordinates
for a restroom at the Bronx Zoo.

119
00:05:54,892 --> 00:05:56,959
You go to the restroom,
you find a phone number.

120
00:05:56,961 --> 00:05:58,927
You send a text to the number,
you get the next clue.

121
00:05:58,929 --> 00:05:59,962
Which is another math problem.

122
00:05:59,964 --> 00:06:00,929
Exactly.

123
00:06:00,931 --> 00:06:02,397
Only, this one is harder.

124
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,099
And that's how it works.

125
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:05,934
You know, but for
each one that you solve,

126
00:06:05,936 --> 00:06:08,103
you get a new set
of GPS coordinates.

127
00:06:08,105 --> 00:06:11,473
And that means that you've
completed a stage, or a portal.

128
00:06:11,475 --> 00:06:13,509
And last night,
I was on Portal Ten.

129
00:06:13,511 --> 00:06:15,711
And...

130
00:06:17,014 --> 00:06:18,313
You know what?

131
00:06:18,315 --> 00:06:20,015
I want to talk
to Sherlock and Joan.

132
00:06:20,017 --> 00:06:21,917
Look, Mr. Emple...
No, I'm sorry.

133
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,019
I told the police down
at the factory that I know them.

134
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:25,287
Isn't that the whole reason

135
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:26,922
that I was brought here
to this squad?

136
00:06:26,924 --> 00:06:30,392
I-I am not saying another word
until they are here.

137
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:35,264
Harlan Emple is
indeed an acquaintance.

138
00:06:35,266 --> 00:06:37,733
He is, in point of fact,
one of my “irregulars.”

139
00:06:37,735 --> 00:06:38,801
One of your what?

140
00:06:38,803 --> 00:06:40,302
Irregulars.

141
00:06:40,304 --> 00:06:41,770
I'm your consultant, Captain;
they are mine.

142
00:06:41,772 --> 00:06:43,572
They're a handful
of experts I turn to

143
00:06:43,574 --> 00:06:46,108
when I encounter problems which
are beyond my pool of knowledge.

144
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,810
Harlan is
a brilliant mathematician.

145
00:06:47,812 --> 00:06:49,778
And on the handful of occasions
I have tackled a case

146
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,046
which pertained
to mathematics...

147
00:06:51,048 --> 00:06:53,182
He helped you out.
Well, the good news

148
00:06:53,184 --> 00:06:56,018
for him is the preliminary
autopsy report just came in

149
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,252
before you got here.

150
00:06:57,254 --> 00:06:59,021
And the M.E. puts
the time of death

151
00:06:59,023 --> 00:07:00,989
between 4:00 and
6:00 p.m. last night.

152
00:07:00,991 --> 00:07:02,124
Mr. Emple was teaching

153
00:07:02,126 --> 00:07:03,358
a class at Columbia.

154
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,394
So the victim is
yet to be identified?

155
00:07:05,396 --> 00:07:07,663
No I.D., no phone.

156
00:07:07,665 --> 00:07:09,865
First detective on the scene
liked it for a mob hit,

157
00:07:09,867 --> 00:07:11,500
so while we're
running the prints,

158
00:07:11,502 --> 00:07:13,602
he's showing the vic's
face around OCID.

159
00:07:13,604 --> 00:07:16,839
Marcus here was about to walk
the scene with Mr. Emple.

160
00:07:16,841 --> 00:07:18,774
You're here now;
you might as well tag along.

161
00:07:18,776 --> 00:07:21,009
Actually, Captain,
I'm quite busy today.

162
00:07:21,011 --> 00:07:22,978
This is a John Doe,
and we got nothing.

163
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,247
And, like you just said,
you're my consultant.

164
00:07:25,249 --> 00:07:26,748
So, go consult.

165
00:07:29,787 --> 00:07:30,986
Watson.

166
00:07:30,988 --> 00:07:32,588
Um, he's your friend.

167
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,523
Actually, Kitty is
otherwise engaged,

168
00:07:34,525 --> 00:07:37,426
and he did actually help both
of us with a case last year.

169
00:07:37,428 --> 00:07:38,493
Did he not?

170
00:07:40,865 --> 00:07:44,099
Have I told you
how good it is to see you?

171
00:07:44,101 --> 00:07:45,367
Yes, you have.
Three times.

172
00:07:45,369 --> 00:07:46,468
Well, it is.

173
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,636
Hey, lousy circumstances.

174
00:07:47,638 --> 00:07:49,371
But, uh, hey...

175
00:07:49,373 --> 00:07:51,740
I heard from your boss that you
just, uh, got back from London.

176
00:07:51,742 --> 00:07:53,308
Were you working
a case or...?

177
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,576
No, I moved back there.

178
00:07:54,578 --> 00:07:55,677
You mean<i> moved,</i> moved?

179
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:56,845
Is there another
definition?

180
00:07:56,847 --> 00:07:58,513
I was there for
eight months,

181
00:07:58,515 --> 00:08:00,883
and had a change of heart
and returned to New York.

182
00:08:00,885 --> 00:08:02,517
So, you moved to London,
and you didn't, uh...

183
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,086
You know what?
Doesn't even matter.

184
00:08:04,088 --> 00:08:05,387
The point is you're back!

185
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:07,389
Mr. Emple.
Uh, duty calls.

186
00:08:07,391 --> 00:08:09,024
Yeah.

187
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:18,634
It's interesting.

188
00:08:18,636 --> 00:08:20,068
Mothballs are interesting?

189
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,070
They were taken from
that cabinet over there.

190
00:08:22,072 --> 00:08:25,941
Obviously, to cover the smell
of John Doe's decay.

191
00:08:25,943 --> 00:08:28,043
The killer didn't
bring them with him.

192
00:08:28,045 --> 00:08:31,179
Perhaps leaving the body here
was not part of his plan, hmm?

193
00:08:32,983 --> 00:08:36,018
Doe was shot in the foot
first and then the knee.

194
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,453
Either those were
two really bad misses or...

195
00:08:38,455 --> 00:08:41,256
Or the killer was torturing him.

196
00:08:41,258 --> 00:08:43,892
This doesn't seem like anything
you can't handle on your own.

197
00:08:43,894 --> 00:08:45,994
So you want to tell me why you
really asked me to come here?

198
00:08:45,996 --> 00:08:48,363
“This doesn't seem like anything
you can't handle on your own.”

199
00:08:48,365 --> 00:08:49,765
That's funny.

200
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:51,566
That's exactly what
I would have said

201
00:08:51,568 --> 00:08:53,602
had I been present when you
asked Kitty for her assistance

202
00:08:53,604 --> 00:08:54,937
with your tawdry side job.

203
00:08:54,939 --> 00:08:57,372
“Tawdry”?
I wanted you to know I approve.

204
00:08:57,374 --> 00:08:59,007
Of what?

205
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:01,376
Your agenda
with regards to Kitty.

206
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:03,078
Several days ago,
I gave you her file.

207
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,913
And then you show up at
the brownstone yesterday,

208
00:09:04,915 --> 00:09:06,515
and you invite her
into an investigation.

209
00:09:06,517 --> 00:09:08,183
Coincidence? No, I think not.

210
00:09:08,185 --> 00:09:11,320
You feel for her.
And now you wish to engage.

211
00:09:11,322 --> 00:09:13,956
It's not an outcome
I would have predicted, no.

212
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,458
But it is one
I approve of, yeah.

213
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,193
She could learn
a great deal from you,

214
00:09:18,195 --> 00:09:20,228
especially with regards
to how to get the most

215
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,864
from my tutelage.

216
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:25,734
So, I've already dispatched her
to, uh, follow your Mr. Keswick.

217
00:09:25,736 --> 00:09:27,836
But that's not
what I actually...

218
00:09:27,838 --> 00:09:29,404
Harlan!

219
00:09:30,741 --> 00:09:33,075
You came here to retrieve
a phone number, did you not?

220
00:09:33,077 --> 00:09:34,609
You would send a text,
and then receive

221
00:09:34,611 --> 00:09:36,845
the next clue in the game
that you were playing.

222
00:09:36,847 --> 00:09:38,747
Yeah, but I didn't find it.

223
00:09:38,749 --> 00:09:40,048
Not that I kept looking

224
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,250
after the dead guy
fell out of the locker.

225
00:09:42,252 --> 00:09:44,052
Yeah, CSU didn't find
any number either.

226
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:46,154
Probably because
it's under that paint.

227
00:09:46,156 --> 00:09:48,190
It's fresh.

228
00:09:48,192 --> 00:09:49,891
Applied in the last

229
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:52,694
24 hours.

230
00:09:52,696 --> 00:09:54,696
Right after John Doe's murder,
I'd wager.

231
00:09:54,698 --> 00:09:57,099
You don't think
this was a mob hit?

232
00:09:57,101 --> 00:09:59,101
Doe and the killer were
playing the game, too.

233
00:09:59,103 --> 00:10:01,203
The killer shot Doe and
then covered up the number

234
00:10:01,205 --> 00:10:02,704
so no one else could use it.

235
00:10:02,706 --> 00:10:04,806
What's the prize
in your little contest?

236
00:10:04,808 --> 00:10:07,576
Well, I'm doing it
mostly for the math.

237
00:10:07,578 --> 00:10:11,480
But, uh, $1,707,071.

238
00:10:11,482 --> 00:10:13,882
It's another
palindromic prime.

239
00:10:13,884 --> 00:10:17,152
Did I not mention the
money at the station?

240
00:10:17,154 --> 00:10:18,587
Who the hell can afford

241
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:20,655
that kind of payout
for a puzzle hunt?

242
00:10:20,657 --> 00:10:22,124
Well, most people
think it's CAML.

243
00:10:22,126 --> 00:10:24,593
The Center for Applied
Mathematics and Logic.

244
00:10:24,595 --> 00:10:26,094
It's located
in Ramapo...

245
00:10:26,096 --> 00:10:27,729
Wait, most people
“think” it's them?

246
00:10:27,731 --> 00:10:29,331
Well, hunts like these,

247
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,266
the organizers are
almost always anonymous.

248
00:10:31,268 --> 00:10:32,401
It's S.O.P.

249
00:10:32,403 --> 00:10:34,302
What about the
contestants?

250
00:10:34,304 --> 00:10:37,005
Is anonymity
also S.O.P.?

251
00:10:37,007 --> 00:10:39,207
For the most part, yeah.

252
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:43,078
But, guys, math peeps
are my peeps, okay?

253
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,314
It's, uh, like
a community, sort of.

254
00:10:46,316 --> 00:10:48,984
I can think of ten
or 12 other people

255
00:10:48,986 --> 00:10:50,018
who were probably competing.

256
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,186
Would that help?

257
00:10:53,157 --> 00:10:55,223
No.

258
00:10:55,225 --> 00:10:58,026
I'm sorry, I don't know him.

259
00:10:58,028 --> 00:11:00,862
But you admit you were
competing in Belphegor's Prime.

260
00:11:00,864 --> 00:11:02,197
I do.

261
00:11:04,835 --> 00:11:05,934
Pepe!

262
00:11:08,172 --> 00:11:10,439
Sorry. He doesn't
like strangers.

263
00:11:12,109 --> 00:11:14,443
Give him one of these.

264
00:11:14,445 --> 00:11:16,111
Get on his good side.

265
00:11:24,288 --> 00:11:26,354
What are you doing?

266
00:11:28,225 --> 00:11:30,725
I'm just verifying that
you've been lying to us.

267
00:11:30,727 --> 00:11:33,895
You did know the
dead man, did you not?

268
00:11:33,897 --> 00:11:36,998
I reviewed his personal
effects at the morgue earlier.

269
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,034
The coroner reported finding
crumbs in one of his pockets.

270
00:11:39,036 --> 00:11:40,036
I tasted one.

271
00:11:40,037 --> 00:11:41,269
Why would you...?

272
00:11:41,271 --> 00:11:42,771
At first, I thought
they were from

273
00:11:42,773 --> 00:11:44,439
a particularly rancid
brand of cheese,

274
00:11:44,441 --> 00:11:47,609
but, no... they're from
one of Pepe's treats.

275
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:49,277
Homemade?

276
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,481
Harlan was able to give us
the names of nine other people

277
00:11:52,483 --> 00:11:54,149
he believed to be
other competitors.

278
00:11:54,151 --> 00:11:55,984
Our colleagues are
investigating them as we speak,

279
00:11:55,986 --> 00:11:57,919
but I'll quite happily
recommend that the NYPD

280
00:11:57,921 --> 00:12:00,222
focus its attention
entirely on you.

281
00:12:04,128 --> 00:12:06,428
His name was Ike Walaczek.

282
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,231
In another lifetime,
he was my boyfriend.

283
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:10,866
And what of
this lifetime?

284
00:12:10,868 --> 00:12:12,701
We were working together.

285
00:12:12,703 --> 00:12:14,769
On Belphegor's.
What?!

286
00:12:14,771 --> 00:12:16,705
He was a numerical analyst
at the Tory Foundation.

287
00:12:16,707 --> 00:12:17,873
I work mostly in combinatorics.

288
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,307
I thought we would make
a good team.

289
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:20,742
But there aren't
supposed to be teams.

290
00:12:20,744 --> 00:12:22,711
Not in a puzzle hunt.
It's bad form.

291
00:12:22,713 --> 00:12:23,713
Harlan...

292
00:12:23,714 --> 00:12:25,514
I'm just saying...

293
00:12:25,516 --> 00:12:27,315
My husband
wouldn't understand,

294
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:30,385
so I decided I wouldn't tell him
until after we won the money.

295
00:12:30,387 --> 00:12:33,121
A team-- so that's how
you got there before me.

296
00:12:33,123 --> 00:12:34,489
I wasn't there.

297
00:12:34,491 --> 00:12:36,258
Tom and I were out of town
until this morning.

298
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,126
His cousin
was getting married in Hawaii.

299
00:12:38,128 --> 00:12:40,662
That's why Ike went
to the coordinates by himself.

300
00:12:40,664 --> 00:12:42,097
Because I couldn't.

301
00:12:44,268 --> 00:12:46,601
These are pictures I took.

302
00:12:46,603 --> 00:12:49,337
Check the dates.

303
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:51,506
You gave the police
nine other names?

304
00:12:51,508 --> 00:12:53,408
People you thought
were competing?

305
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,776
I've got 16.

306
00:12:54,778 --> 00:12:56,311
And I know they were competing.

307
00:12:58,448 --> 00:13:01,249
He talked to her
outside the Jamaica property

308
00:13:01,251 --> 00:13:05,720
for about 20 minutes,
and then this truck rolled up.

309
00:13:05,722 --> 00:13:07,822
Any idea what's
inside the crate?

310
00:13:07,824 --> 00:13:09,024
Nope.

311
00:13:09,026 --> 00:13:10,392
I can't identify
the woman either.

312
00:13:10,394 --> 00:13:12,260
Everything about her
said money though.

313
00:13:12,262 --> 00:13:15,363
She, Keswick
and the mystery box

314
00:13:15,365 --> 00:13:17,732
stayed inside the building
for about three hours,

315
00:13:17,734 --> 00:13:20,001
and then off they went.

316
00:13:20,904 --> 00:13:22,170
Good.

317
00:13:22,172 --> 00:13:23,872
Okay.

318
00:13:23,874 --> 00:13:26,074
You know where
to send the check.

319
00:13:26,076 --> 00:13:30,145
You haven't asked me about
the file Sherlock gave me.

320
00:13:30,147 --> 00:13:32,080
Why would I?

321
00:13:32,082 --> 00:13:36,184
You said it would give me
a better sense of you-- it did.

322
00:13:37,588 --> 00:13:40,155
That's why you asked
for my help.

323
00:13:40,157 --> 00:13:41,990
Because you felt sorry for me.

324
00:13:41,992 --> 00:13:44,226
No.

325
00:13:44,228 --> 00:13:46,194
You just don't seem interested
in anything

326
00:13:46,196 --> 00:13:48,063
outside of becoming
a detective.

327
00:13:48,065 --> 00:13:50,999
There she is.

328
00:13:51,001 --> 00:13:53,301
The old counselor.

329
00:13:53,303 --> 00:13:55,637
Who used to hold
Sherlock's hand.

330
00:13:57,608 --> 00:13:59,741
Everything that you read,

331
00:13:59,743 --> 00:14:02,510
everything that happened to me,
that's all it is.

332
00:14:02,512 --> 00:14:04,646
It's just something
that happened.

333
00:14:04,648 --> 00:14:08,116
And it's all
in the past now.

334
00:14:08,118 --> 00:14:10,685
So let's just
leave it there, shall we?

335
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:24,667
Hello.

336
00:14:24,668 --> 00:14:26,001
You've had sex.

337
00:14:26,003 --> 00:14:27,202
Excuse me?

338
00:14:27,204 --> 00:14:28,503
I can hear it
in your voice.

339
00:14:28,505 --> 00:14:29,771
You've joined paunches.

340
00:14:29,773 --> 00:14:30,972
Good for you, Watson.

341
00:14:30,974 --> 00:14:32,807
As you know, I think
the act of love

342
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:34,676
can be quite conducive to...
What do you want?

343
00:14:34,678 --> 00:14:36,911
Merely to apprise you
of a new development

344
00:14:36,913 --> 00:14:38,280
in the murder of
Ike Walaczek.

345
00:14:38,282 --> 00:14:40,115
As I informed
you yesterday,

346
00:14:40,117 --> 00:14:42,284
Harlan and I were given
a new list of competitors.

347
00:14:42,286 --> 00:14:45,320
One name leapt out:
Byron Lowenthal.

348
00:14:45,322 --> 00:14:48,156
He's a statistician at the
Public Utilities Commission

349
00:14:48,158 --> 00:14:50,425
and a diagnosed
paranoid schizophrenic.

350
00:14:50,427 --> 00:14:52,160
He's been hospitalized
for becoming violent

351
00:14:52,162 --> 00:14:53,728
on no fewer
than three occasions.

352
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,964
Certainly sounds like
it could be our guy.

353
00:14:55,966 --> 00:14:59,367
Unfortunately, Mr. Lowenthal had
another break earlier this year.

354
00:14:59,369 --> 00:15:02,137
He's been staying in
a transient hotel ever since.

355
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:04,239
Detective Bell and I
are going to speak with him.

356
00:15:04,241 --> 00:15:05,307
You want me to meet you?

357
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:06,875
Oh, no, we're already here.

358
00:15:06,877 --> 00:15:08,410
Anyway, now that I know
that you've enjoyed coitus

359
00:15:08,412 --> 00:15:09,778
and could enjoy more
in the near future...

360
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,846
When you're done,
we need to talk.

361
00:15:14,718 --> 00:15:16,818
Byron Lowenthal,
you in there?

362
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,053
Who is it?

363
00:15:18,055 --> 00:15:19,754
It's Detective Bell, NYPD.

364
00:15:19,756 --> 00:15:22,257
My colleague and I would like
to ask you some questions.

365
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:24,592
Let me
get some pants on.

366
00:15:37,341 --> 00:15:40,008
S-Sorry, I just... I, um...

367
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,310
I-I thought I heard
Mr. Lowenthal retr...

368
00:16:19,154 --> 00:16:21,267
You guys got lucky.

369
00:16:21,268 --> 00:16:22,868
Well, luck had little
to do with it, actually.

370
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,536
I... I heard Mr. Lowenthal

371
00:16:24,538 --> 00:16:27,039
pulling a heavy object off
a shelf, placing it on his bed,

372
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,041
and the sound of
the zipper indicated

373
00:16:29,043 --> 00:16:30,976
that it was
a large gun case.

374
00:16:30,978 --> 00:16:33,579
Looks like he was sane enough
to do math, but not much else.

375
00:16:33,581 --> 00:16:34,747
Plus, he was
pretty hopped up.

376
00:16:34,749 --> 00:16:36,448
Caffeine pills,
energy drinks,

377
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,251
pretty much every legal
stimulant you can buy.

378
00:16:39,253 --> 00:16:40,853
Plus a few illegal ones.

379
00:16:40,855 --> 00:16:42,821
Hmm. Obviously, he was
keeping himself awake

380
00:16:42,823 --> 00:16:44,490
so he could work on
Belphegor's.

381
00:16:44,492 --> 00:16:47,392
This... is obvious to you?

382
00:16:47,394 --> 00:16:48,961
I confess the maths
are beyond me,

383
00:16:48,963 --> 00:16:51,130
but I took the liberty of
sending pictures of what

384
00:16:51,132 --> 00:16:52,865
appear to be Mr. Lowenthal's
most recent scribbles

385
00:16:52,867 --> 00:16:54,166
to Harlan Emple,
and he's confirmed

386
00:16:54,168 --> 00:16:55,667
they are part of the contest.

387
00:16:55,669 --> 00:16:56,969
With your permission,
I'd like copies of these

388
00:16:56,971 --> 00:16:58,837
sent to my home
so he can review them.

389
00:16:58,839 --> 00:16:59,972
What for?

390
00:16:59,974 --> 00:17:01,073
If Byron Lowenthal

391
00:17:01,075 --> 00:17:02,441
did kill Ike Walaczek,

392
00:17:02,443 --> 00:17:04,109
then he used
and obscured a phone number,

393
00:17:04,111 --> 00:17:05,878
which would have yielded
the next problem.

394
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,379
That problem's solution

395
00:17:07,381 --> 00:17:08,714
would be GPS coordinates.

396
00:17:08,716 --> 00:17:10,415
If he's recorded them
in his books...

397
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:12,551
Your pal will be able to tell us
where he's headed next.

398
00:17:12,553 --> 00:17:14,853
I'll get our guys to give you

399
00:17:14,855 --> 00:17:16,388
whatever you need.

400
00:17:17,258 --> 00:17:18,991
Scans are still coming through,

401
00:17:18,993 --> 00:17:21,260
but I've put what we've got
so far up on the wall.

402
00:17:21,262 --> 00:17:23,262
Sherlock said that
you prefer it that way.

403
00:17:23,264 --> 00:17:25,030
Picked it up from him,
actually.

404
00:17:25,032 --> 00:17:28,600
Makes me feel like I'm really
inside of the problem.

405
00:17:30,704 --> 00:17:33,372
I'll, uh, let you know
if I need anything.

406
00:17:34,275 --> 00:17:35,974
Oh, I work without a shirt.

407
00:17:35,976 --> 00:17:38,911
Sometimes makes me feel
closer to the numbers.

408
00:17:38,913 --> 00:17:42,147
You'll need to, uh,
check the printer in the study

409
00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:43,615
for more pages.

410
00:17:43,617 --> 00:17:45,417
Uh, this is nice,
you know?

411
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:47,452
Meeting another member
of the team.

412
00:17:47,454 --> 00:17:48,654
You know, Team Sherlock.

413
00:17:48,656 --> 00:17:50,656
You help him, I help him...

414
00:17:51,926 --> 00:17:53,559
Obviously, you haven't
tackled a case

415
00:17:53,561 --> 00:17:55,093
with high-order math since
you started working with him,

416
00:17:55,095 --> 00:17:57,729
or we would've...

417
00:17:57,731 --> 00:17:59,031
What?

418
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:00,232
What?

419
00:18:00,234 --> 00:18:01,834
Wait...

420
00:18:01,836 --> 00:18:04,002
have you worked a case
with high-order math?

421
00:18:04,805 --> 00:18:06,238
You have, haven't you?

422
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,840
Does it matter?

423
00:18:07,842 --> 00:18:09,842
Of course it...

424
00:18:09,844 --> 00:18:11,443
Oh, my God.

425
00:18:11,445 --> 00:18:13,278
Did he fire me?

426
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,980
All I know
is that back in London,

427
00:18:14,982 --> 00:18:16,982
we worked a case that involved
Fibonacci spirals...

428
00:18:16,984 --> 00:18:18,483
He fired me.

429
00:18:18,485 --> 00:18:21,386
...and he called some woman
named Indira Patel.

430
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,856
She's at Berkeley.

431
00:18:23,858 --> 00:18:25,624
I'm three time zones closer!

432
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:27,125
You're here now.

433
00:18:27,127 --> 00:18:29,428
Sure, because I found
a dead body.

434
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,531
I have to go; I have to run
some errands for Sherlock.

435
00:18:35,936 --> 00:18:37,903
I-I don't know
what was in the crate,

436
00:18:37,905 --> 00:18:39,271
but the stenciling on
the side indicates

437
00:18:39,273 --> 00:18:40,772
it came from one of
the SUNY schools.

438
00:18:40,774 --> 00:18:42,908
I put another detective
on Keswick...

439
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:45,177
Don't kill me, I had to
use your razor to shave.

440
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:47,179
I...

441
00:18:47,181 --> 00:18:49,147
You must be Andrew.

442
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:50,515
Sherlock Holmes.

443
00:18:50,517 --> 00:18:52,551
Sorry.

444
00:18:52,553 --> 00:18:55,487
Joan said you were coming;
I... I forgot.

445
00:18:55,489 --> 00:18:57,122
It's not how
I wanted to meet you.

446
00:18:57,124 --> 00:18:58,891
She said you can tell
a lot about people

447
00:18:58,893 --> 00:19:00,192
just by looking at them.

448
00:19:00,194 --> 00:19:02,261
I swear, I...
usually wear pants.

449
00:19:02,263 --> 00:19:03,729
Well, in my experience,
most people

450
00:19:03,731 --> 00:19:05,264
need only be concerned
I won't notice

451
00:19:05,266 --> 00:19:06,498
anything worth remarking upon.

452
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:10,535
Watson seems adequately sexed.

453
00:19:11,939 --> 00:19:13,672
Hey.

454
00:19:13,674 --> 00:19:15,674
I was just introducing myself.

455
00:19:17,945 --> 00:19:20,379
I've got that thing.
I'll see you tonight.

456
00:19:20,381 --> 00:19:21,580
Okay.

457
00:19:27,855 --> 00:19:30,188
Your home, Watson...

458
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,823
it's utterly pleasant.

459
00:19:31,825 --> 00:19:33,692
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

460
00:19:33,694 --> 00:19:35,394
When you told me
you wanted a life of your own,

461
00:19:35,396 --> 00:19:36,595
I didn't realize
that you meant you wanted

462
00:19:36,597 --> 00:19:38,030
the same life everyone else has.

463
00:19:38,032 --> 00:19:39,464
But at any rate,
none of my business, is it?

464
00:19:39,466 --> 00:19:41,233
It's not.
And I didn't ask you here

465
00:19:41,235 --> 00:19:42,634
to talk about my apartment.

466
00:19:42,636 --> 00:19:44,970
No, you asked me here
to discuss Kitty.

467
00:19:44,972 --> 00:19:46,471
If she were not
the topic of conversation,

468
00:19:46,473 --> 00:19:48,941
then you wouldn't have
invited me to your home,

469
00:19:48,943 --> 00:19:50,776
where there's no chance
she'll be present.

470
00:19:52,346 --> 00:19:53,946
She disappointed you
in some way.

471
00:19:53,948 --> 00:19:55,247
Skills not up to snuff?

472
00:19:55,249 --> 00:19:57,316
Please remember
she is a novice.

473
00:19:57,318 --> 00:19:58,850
Actually, she did a great job.

474
00:19:58,852 --> 00:20:00,285
But I have some concerns.

475
00:20:00,287 --> 00:20:01,954
I thought we could
talk about them.

476
00:20:03,757 --> 00:20:04,923
You think that
Kitty needs help

477
00:20:04,925 --> 00:20:06,091
above and beyond
my mentorship.

478
00:20:06,093 --> 00:20:07,392
You read the same
file I did.

479
00:20:07,394 --> 00:20:08,894
She's a rape victim.

480
00:20:08,896 --> 00:20:11,296
She was kept and tortured.

481
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,899
Mm.

482
00:20:16,136 --> 00:20:19,171
You know me, so surely you know

483
00:20:19,173 --> 00:20:22,874
I've broached the subject of
a support group meeting before.

484
00:20:22,876 --> 00:20:25,010
Even offered
to pay for therapy.

485
00:20:25,012 --> 00:20:26,812
She's not interested, I know.

486
00:20:26,814 --> 00:20:28,447
Just as you also know

487
00:20:28,449 --> 00:20:30,749
someone with a problem
can't be forced to get help.

488
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:32,551
They have to want it.

489
00:20:32,553 --> 00:20:34,786
What Kitty wants
is to be a detective.

490
00:20:36,523 --> 00:20:38,490
I am taking pains
to try and channel

491
00:20:38,492 --> 00:20:40,592
her residual feelings
into her work.

492
00:20:42,329 --> 00:20:44,463
Well, that works out
great for you.

493
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:48,400
You told me that
you took on a partner

494
00:20:48,402 --> 00:20:50,635
because you wanted to replicate
what you and I had.

495
00:20:50,637 --> 00:20:52,637
That you thought it helped
with your recovery.

496
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:54,539
You think I would
try and take advantage

497
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,208
of the victim of a trauma?

498
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,910
Of course not, but there is
a conflict of interest here.

499
00:20:58,912 --> 00:21:02,447
She needs what she needs,
but you need what you need, too.

500
00:21:06,053 --> 00:21:10,055
It's-it's good that you're
in her life now, Watson.

501
00:21:10,057 --> 00:21:12,524
I mean,
it's commonly believed that, um,

502
00:21:12,526 --> 00:21:16,228
a child benefits mostly from
the presence of two parents.

503
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,164
He-- or she, in this case--
can absorb certain qualities

504
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,466
from the father--
clear-eyed view of the world,

505
00:21:21,468 --> 00:21:23,168
capacity of
rational thought, etcetera.

506
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,170
They can also absorb certain
qualities from the mother.

507
00:21:25,172 --> 00:21:27,105
Excuse me, but I am not
Kitty's mother,

508
00:21:27,107 --> 00:21:28,807
and she sure as hell
is not our child.

509
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:30,942
You brought her here;
she looks up to you.

510
00:21:30,944 --> 00:21:32,944
She says that she doesn't
need help-- fine--

511
00:21:32,946 --> 00:21:34,579
but you know better.

512
00:21:34,581 --> 00:21:37,082
And you're gonna have to be
the one that tells her.

513
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,620
It's Harlan.

514
00:21:41,622 --> 00:21:44,523
Making progress with the maths.

515
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,660
We thought
that Byron and Ike

516
00:21:48,662 --> 00:21:50,462
arrived at Portal Ten
simultaneously.

517
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,664
That would've meant that they
were doing all the same math

518
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,032
at essentially
the same time.

519
00:21:54,034 --> 00:21:56,001
Only, the math
you found at Byron's place

520
00:21:56,003 --> 00:21:57,003
says that's wrong.

521
00:21:57,004 --> 00:21:58,470
He was one step behind Ike.

522
00:21:58,472 --> 00:22:00,705
Are you proposing he did
not kill Mr. Walaczek?

523
00:22:00,707 --> 00:22:03,175
I don't know, but that's
not the weirdest part.

524
00:22:03,177 --> 00:22:04,810
Byron was obsessive.

525
00:22:04,812 --> 00:22:06,211
He time-stamped
almost everything he did.

526
00:22:06,213 --> 00:22:09,047
He only solved
the Portal Nine problem,

527
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:11,316
the same problem that sent me
to that old factory last night.

528
00:22:11,318 --> 00:22:12,884
But get this--

529
00:22:12,886 --> 00:22:14,686
he wasn't given
the same problem as me.

530
00:22:14,688 --> 00:22:16,655
And so it would've yielded
GPS coordinates

531
00:22:16,657 --> 00:22:18,323
for an entirely
different location.

532
00:22:18,325 --> 00:22:21,760
The person in charge of
the game changed the clue

533
00:22:21,762 --> 00:22:23,328
after the police
found Ike's body.

534
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:25,964
Well, he had to, right?

535
00:22:25,966 --> 00:22:27,899
If he hadn't, he would be
sending other competitors

536
00:22:27,901 --> 00:22:29,101
to an active crime scene.

537
00:22:29,103 --> 00:22:30,402
The important thing is

538
00:22:30,404 --> 00:22:31,536
I figured out the coordinates

539
00:22:31,538 --> 00:22:32,771
to the second location.

540
00:22:32,773 --> 00:22:35,540
I know where Byron went.

541
00:22:35,542 --> 00:22:36,842
What are you doing?

542
00:22:36,844 --> 00:22:38,410
You're saying he
time-stamped everything.

543
00:22:38,412 --> 00:22:40,345
I'm looking at the time
he received his clues.

544
00:22:40,347 --> 00:22:42,647
It's all there, to the second,
but what does that have to do...

545
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:44,149
What if you hadn't
found a body?

546
00:22:44,151 --> 00:22:46,118
If the game had
proceeded as planned,

547
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,486
what were you meant
to do there?

548
00:22:47,488 --> 00:22:49,354
I would have sent a text
to the phone number,

549
00:22:49,356 --> 00:22:51,523
the one that the killer painted
over, and then I would have

550
00:22:51,525 --> 00:22:52,891
gotten a message back
with the next problem.

551
00:22:52,893 --> 00:22:54,559
There's an extra
step in there.

552
00:22:54,561 --> 00:22:56,428
Why all this rigmarole with
phone numbers and texts?

553
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,064
Why not just post the problem
itself at the factory?

554
00:22:59,066 --> 00:23:02,100
I don't know, it's just the way
the game is played.

555
00:23:02,102 --> 00:23:04,102
They're for an old
industrial area in Queens.

556
00:23:04,104 --> 00:23:06,805
You're welcome
for finding your suspect.

557
00:23:06,807 --> 00:23:09,207
If I'm right, Harlan,
what you've found...

558
00:23:09,209 --> 00:23:11,109
is the site of
another murder.

559
00:23:11,111 --> 00:23:13,245
Byron Lowenthal's.

560
00:23:15,983 --> 00:23:18,216
You were right,
Lowenthal's dead.

561
00:23:18,218 --> 00:23:20,952
He was shot in the foot,
then the knee.

562
00:23:20,954 --> 00:23:22,821
Just like
Ike Wallaczek.

563
00:23:22,823 --> 00:23:26,391
I'm, uh, gonna look
over here now.

564
00:23:26,393 --> 00:23:29,427
Well, we think the perp
was pulling the body

565
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:31,429
to a car that was parked
over there.

566
00:23:31,431 --> 00:23:34,065
Then he just
left him here.

567
00:23:34,067 --> 00:23:35,901
Probably afraid
he'd been spotted.

568
00:23:35,903 --> 00:23:38,803
There's a lot
of homeless in the area.

569
00:23:41,441 --> 00:23:43,008
Question is:

570
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:45,010
how'd you know
Lowenthal was the next victim

571
00:23:45,012 --> 00:23:46,511
and not the killer?

572
00:23:49,316 --> 00:23:51,750
Well, that's
quite simple, really.

573
00:23:51,752 --> 00:23:54,352
The game is directing
its players to remote locales,

574
00:23:54,354 --> 00:23:56,788
and then instructing them
to send a text message

575
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,256
indicating their presence.

576
00:23:58,258 --> 00:24:00,125
I suspect the killer wanted
to remove the body

577
00:24:00,127 --> 00:24:02,928
so he could keep this new
location “in play,” so to speak.

578
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:05,130
Still missing the “simple” part.

579
00:24:05,132 --> 00:24:06,698
The late Mr. Lowenthal

580
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,366
received his final clue

581
00:24:08,368 --> 00:24:10,235
after Harlan discovered
Ike Wallaczek's body,

582
00:24:10,237 --> 00:24:12,737
but before news of the killing
had reached the media.

583
00:24:12,739 --> 00:24:14,439
That means the
game's designer

584
00:24:14,441 --> 00:24:16,408
knew the location
had been compromised.

585
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,577
And the only way
that he could have known that,

586
00:24:18,579 --> 00:24:20,111
at the time that he knew it,

587
00:24:20,113 --> 00:24:21,880
was if he, himself,
was the killer.

588
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,917
Belphegor's Prime is not
a treasure hunt.

589
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,619
It's a trap.

590
00:24:40,696 --> 00:24:42,196
Better?

591
00:24:42,198 --> 00:24:44,665
False alarm.

592
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:47,668
But I still feel
a little queasy.

593
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,273
This new dead guy--

594
00:24:52,275 --> 00:24:54,875
your friend said that he was
tortured, too, right?

595
00:24:54,877 --> 00:24:57,244
Right before the killer tried
to abscond with his corpse.

596
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:59,213
I assume
he intended to take

597
00:24:59,215 --> 00:25:02,383
Ike Wallaczek away with him
as well, only Ike was too large.

598
00:25:02,385 --> 00:25:04,685
A speedy mothballing
was the best he could do.

599
00:25:04,687 --> 00:25:07,221
So, just to recap,

600
00:25:07,223 --> 00:25:09,657
I've spent the last
few months of my life

601
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:13,360
playing a game that was
designed to kill me.

602
00:25:13,362 --> 00:25:15,629
Got to be a metaphor
in there somewhere, right?

603
00:25:15,631 --> 00:25:18,966
I think the word you're
looking for is “moral.”

604
00:25:18,968 --> 00:25:21,902
There is a moral in there:
games are for idiots.

605
00:25:24,707 --> 00:25:26,473
Breaking news from Ramapo.

606
00:25:26,475 --> 00:25:29,443
Kitty reports the Center for
Applied Mathematics and Logic

607
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,912
is not the sponsor
of Belphegor's Prime.

608
00:25:31,914 --> 00:25:34,148
Then it's got to be
a serial killer, right?

609
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,716
Someone who's obsessed
with mathematicians?

610
00:25:35,718 --> 00:25:37,284
Mm.

611
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,920
Perhaps he was bullied
by mathematicians as a child.

612
00:25:39,922 --> 00:25:42,056
Or mathematicians
killed his parents.

613
00:25:42,058 --> 00:25:43,657
I'm being serious.

614
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:45,726
Serial killers who devise
elaborate death traps

615
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,461
are the stuff of pulp fiction.

616
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:49,229
And besides, with respect
to these murders,

617
00:25:49,231 --> 00:25:51,165
there are none
of the elaborations

618
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:53,767
which mark that sort of culprit.

619
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:55,970
If anything, I would describe
the work as businesslike.

620
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:58,172
Then it's the government.

621
00:25:58,174 --> 00:26:01,241
I mean, the-the game was some
sort of test to weed out people

622
00:26:01,243 --> 00:26:03,243
who could weaponize math.

623
00:26:03,245 --> 00:26:05,179
The American intelligence
apparatus may be clod-like,

624
00:26:05,181 --> 00:26:07,014
but I think they would
do a better job

625
00:26:07,016 --> 00:26:08,749
of disposing of two bodies,
don't you?

626
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:11,785
Watson?

627
00:26:11,787 --> 00:26:13,621
I just heard
from one of the suspects

628
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:14,922
Marcus and I talked to
yesterday,

629
00:26:14,924 --> 00:26:16,290
another puzzle-hunter.

630
00:26:16,292 --> 00:26:18,525
Tell me he confessed
to the murders.

631
00:26:18,527 --> 00:26:20,427
We ruled him out right away,
but he heard about

632
00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:22,329
Byron Lowenthal's murder on
the news and wanted me to know

633
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:25,165
he's at a friend's place,
some guy named Paul.

634
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,934
That is fascinating.

635
00:26:26,936 --> 00:26:28,369
Actually, it might be.

636
00:26:28,371 --> 00:26:31,038
Paul is positive he knows
who the killer is.

637
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,807
I know the guards
are a bit much,

638
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:35,509
but I wanted everyone
to feel safe.

639
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:38,178
And, besides,
math has been good to me.

640
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,279
Commodities.

641
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:40,848
So, you and your friends,

642
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:43,150
you were competitors
in Belphegor's Prime?

643
00:26:43,152 --> 00:26:45,352
Most of us. Some of the others
are just here for the math.

644
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,121
You said you could
identify the killer.

645
00:26:47,123 --> 00:26:49,323
I can, sort of.

646
00:26:52,061 --> 00:26:54,194
“Mo Shellshocker.”

647
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:56,930
It's a pseudonym,
obviously, but I'm telling you,

648
00:26:56,932 --> 00:26:58,365
this is the guy
you're looking for.

649
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,600
I've heard of him.

650
00:26:59,602 --> 00:27:01,335
He uses his blog
to expose bad math.

651
00:27:01,337 --> 00:27:03,837
Corrupt economists, biased
pollsters, that sort of thing.

652
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:05,572
He's actually
sort of a crusader.

653
00:27:05,574 --> 00:27:06,574
He's a murderer.

654
00:27:06,575 --> 00:27:09,143
How can you be
so sure?

655
00:27:09,145 --> 00:27:10,744
When he isn't crusading,
he's competing in puzzle hunts.

656
00:27:10,746 --> 00:27:11,812
A few months ago,

657
00:27:11,814 --> 00:27:13,080
he claimed to
have solved

658
00:27:13,082 --> 00:27:14,815
Cicada 3301 two
years in a row.

659
00:27:14,817 --> 00:27:17,484
Some people called BS,
including...

660
00:27:17,486 --> 00:27:20,120
Ike Wallaczek
and Byron Lowenthal.

661
00:27:20,122 --> 00:27:21,221
“WallaCheckYourMath,”

662
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:22,489
“ByLow2020.”

663
00:27:22,491 --> 00:27:23,757
Those are their
online handles.

664
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:25,392
Their friends
will confirm it.

665
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,528
A flame war does not
a murderer make.

666
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:30,097
The stuff these guys were
slinging at each other was ugly.

667
00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:32,099
Mo knew they were into hunts,
and so he built one

668
00:27:32,101 --> 00:27:34,034
that would send them to places
where he could kill them.

669
00:27:34,036 --> 00:27:35,469
That's what we're
doing here is

670
00:27:35,471 --> 00:27:36,837
we're just sifting
through all the math

671
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:38,338
he's posted on his blog
over the years,

672
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,840
to see if we could
find his signature

673
00:27:39,842 --> 00:27:41,975
or something that
could identify him.

674
00:27:41,977 --> 00:27:45,279
If two people weren't dead,
we'd probably be having fun.

675
00:27:45,281 --> 00:27:46,747
But still, the
chances that he left

676
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:48,582
something like that
in his math...

677
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,784
If it's there, we'll find it.
In the meantime,

678
00:27:50,786 --> 00:27:52,186
we thought the
police should know

679
00:27:52,188 --> 00:27:53,687
who they're really
dealing with.

680
00:27:53,689 --> 00:27:55,389
<i>I've got to go meet someone</i>

681
00:27:55,391 --> 00:27:56,924
about my other case.

682
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:59,927
You're good to pass all this
along to Marcus? Okay.

683
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:03,030
I must say, I'm surprised you
didn't offer to stay and help.

684
00:28:03,032 --> 00:28:05,265
Mr. Ettinger makes
a compelling case with respect

685
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,067
to Mo Shellshocker's
viability as a suspect.

686
00:28:07,069 --> 00:28:09,002
Mo is a genius.

687
00:28:09,004 --> 00:28:10,637
We're talking off the charts.

688
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:12,139
Leibniz meets Euler meets Gauss.

689
00:28:12,141 --> 00:28:14,108
Huh.
He may have an ego,

690
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,110
but he's not gonna kill
anyone over a few comments.

691
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:18,312
So, while “The League of
Concerned Mathematician”"

692
00:28:18,314 --> 00:28:21,014
chases its tail up there, I
am gonna do the smart thing

693
00:28:21,016 --> 00:28:22,416
and get out of town.

694
00:28:22,418 --> 00:28:24,485
You can let me know
when it all blows over.

695
00:28:24,487 --> 00:28:26,386
You're not going
anywhere, Harlan.

696
00:28:26,388 --> 00:28:29,223
Or should I call you
Mo Shellshocker?

697
00:28:32,728 --> 00:28:34,661
Did you honestly think
I wouldn't recognize

698
00:28:34,663 --> 00:28:36,130
an anagram of my own name?

699
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:40,567
I knew I should've gone
with “Choker Hell Moss”"

700
00:28:40,569 --> 00:28:42,569
But I never thought
that you would see it, okay?

701
00:28:42,571 --> 00:28:44,104
Math is my thing, not yours.

702
00:28:44,106 --> 00:28:46,473
It's my name, Harlan;
that makes it my thing.

703
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,675
It was an homage.

704
00:28:48,677 --> 00:28:50,043
Explain.

705
00:28:50,045 --> 00:28:52,045
Every day, all over the world,

706
00:28:52,047 --> 00:28:54,348
math is used to trick people.

707
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,917
Data dredging to sell
pharmaceuticals.

708
00:28:56,919 --> 00:28:59,720
Publication bias
to justify wars.

709
00:28:59,722 --> 00:29:02,322
In the wrong hands, math can be
manipulated, abused.

710
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:05,425
And I decided to do
something about it.

711
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:09,596
You catch people
who murder other people.

712
00:29:09,598 --> 00:29:11,431
I catch people who murder math.

713
00:29:11,433 --> 00:29:14,568
According to this,
Mo is a wanted man.

714
00:29:17,606 --> 00:29:19,940
Harlan?

715
00:29:19,942 --> 00:29:23,110
The D.O.D. was working
on a new fighter.

716
00:29:23,112 --> 00:29:27,047
Only, I knew that the
performance stats were bogus.

717
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:29,116
A friend of mine found
the internal numbers,

718
00:29:29,118 --> 00:29:31,251
and I sort of published them.

719
00:29:31,253 --> 00:29:33,320
So you put classified
Department of Defense documents

720
00:29:33,322 --> 00:29:34,888
on the Internet.

721
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:36,623
Isn't that what
you would have done?

722
00:29:38,928 --> 00:29:41,562
Fine! I screwed up, okay?

723
00:29:41,564 --> 00:29:43,730
But, hey, that's what I do,
right? I screw up.

724
00:29:43,732 --> 00:29:46,233
If I didn't, then probably you
wouldn't have secretly fired me.

725
00:29:46,235 --> 00:29:47,968
Excuse me?

726
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,403
I know about Indira Patel!

727
00:29:51,006 --> 00:29:53,340
I know you replaced me.

728
00:29:55,144 --> 00:29:58,979
Kitty, I think
we could use some tea.

729
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:04,318
Just tell me.

730
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,253
Tell me what math I got wrong.

731
00:30:06,255 --> 00:30:09,356
Tell me why you didn't let me
make it up to you.

732
00:30:09,358 --> 00:30:12,926
It wasn't the maths, it was you.

733
00:30:14,763 --> 00:30:18,232
Your work was impeccable.

734
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:20,334
And for the most part,
I enjoyed our collaborations.

735
00:30:20,336 --> 00:30:24,838
B-But over time, you just...
you became quite... needy.

736
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,406
What are you talking about?

737
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:29,109
Y-You asked my advice
on-on social matters,

738
00:30:29,111 --> 00:30:32,512
and you even invited me
to a party.

739
00:30:32,514 --> 00:30:34,648
You were my friend.

740
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,416
I was your employer, Harlan.

741
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:37,918
A-And you were my consultant.

742
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,419
One of many.

743
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:43,757
I know that I'm a little
obsessed with what I do.

744
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:46,960
That has always made it hard
to make friends.

745
00:30:46,962 --> 00:30:50,664
And I used to feel pretty bad
about that, and then I met you.

746
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:52,566
And I thought to myself,

747
00:30:52,568 --> 00:30:55,903
hey, if it doesn't bother him,
why should I let it bother me?

748
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:03,810
I got a lot
out of the work that we did.

749
00:31:03,812 --> 00:31:06,146
A lot.

750
00:31:06,148 --> 00:31:11,218
But if someone like you thinks
that I'm a loser, then...

751
00:31:22,564 --> 00:31:24,965
Hey, are we still doing this?

752
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:26,366
Doing what?

753
00:31:26,368 --> 00:31:28,502
Talking about the case.

754
00:31:28,504 --> 00:31:30,070
You're just sitting there.

755
00:31:30,072 --> 00:31:32,105
I'm thinking.

756
00:31:32,107 --> 00:31:34,308
I suspect the silence
is exacerbated

757
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,143
by the nature
of our communication.

758
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:37,811
Yes. Well, I don't
live there anymore.

759
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,713
So, if you want
to talk shop at night,

760
00:31:39,715 --> 00:31:41,515
this is the best I can do.

761
00:31:41,517 --> 00:31:45,252
Keep asking myself:
what did the killer want?

762
00:31:45,254 --> 00:31:48,255
He went to great lengths to lure
brilliant mathematicians

763
00:31:48,257 --> 00:31:49,489
to their deaths.

764
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,525
Winnowed out
the less gifted

765
00:31:51,527 --> 00:31:54,061
by making his problems
more and more complicated.

766
00:31:54,063 --> 00:31:57,597
He had a type, but I still think
he's a serial killer

767
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:59,266
only in the most
technical sense.

768
00:31:59,268 --> 00:32:01,201
He tortured both his victims.

769
00:32:01,203 --> 00:32:02,936
But there's no sign
that he enjoyed it.

770
00:32:02,938 --> 00:32:04,538
The work was
utilitarian,

771
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,740
suggesting it was
less for pleasure

772
00:32:06,742 --> 00:32:10,043
and more for persuasion.

773
00:32:10,045 --> 00:32:11,945
He wanted something.

774
00:32:11,947 --> 00:32:13,714
But what?

775
00:32:13,716 --> 00:32:16,483
Maybe there's a connection
between Wallaczek and Lowenthal

776
00:32:16,485 --> 00:32:18,418
we haven't spotted yet.

777
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,220
Maybe they were working
on a project together,

778
00:32:20,222 --> 00:32:21,822
something that was worth
a lot of money.

779
00:32:21,824 --> 00:32:23,857
There's no way the killer
could have predicted

780
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:26,093
which competitors would make it
to the terminal stage.

781
00:32:26,095 --> 00:32:28,795
That part of the game
was beyond his control.

782
00:32:28,797 --> 00:32:30,664
If it weren't,
he would've been prepared

783
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:33,300
to dispose of a body
the size of Ike Wallaczek's.

784
00:32:33,302 --> 00:32:35,335
So, even if there were a
connection between the victims,

785
00:32:35,337 --> 00:32:37,070
the killer could not
have counted on them

786
00:32:37,072 --> 00:32:38,839
being lured into his trap.

787
00:32:38,841 --> 00:32:41,041
Certainly not
in sequence.

788
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:45,112
His game was, in many respects,
one of chance.

789
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:51,718
Suggesting he knows what
he wants, but not who has it.

790
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,888
Like he was on a puzzle hunt
of his own.

791
00:32:56,825 --> 00:32:58,859
I'm back.

792
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:05,665
I'll set up
downstairs, yeah?

793
00:33:09,138 --> 00:33:11,238
I've been thinking about
what you said earlier.

794
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,740
I've decided to engage her
one more time

795
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:15,609
with regards
to her recuperation.

796
00:33:17,112 --> 00:33:21,815
I doubt she'll listen,
but I'll keep you apprised.

797
00:33:25,954 --> 00:33:27,421
I've been thinking.

798
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:29,623
About?
You. Your history.

799
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:31,825
Your decision
not to seek help.

800
00:33:31,827 --> 00:33:34,594
I think it's
a mistake.

801
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,530
Oh?

802
00:33:36,532 --> 00:33:38,198
I've looked into a number
of support groups.

803
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,633
As you are well aware,

804
00:33:39,635 --> 00:33:41,701
I have benefited greatly
from similar settings.

805
00:33:41,703 --> 00:33:43,270
You have.

806
00:33:43,272 --> 00:33:44,638
The process, I find,

807
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,906
is not unlike
voiding one's bowels...

808
00:33:45,908 --> 00:33:47,808
I'll go.
What?

809
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:49,676
I'll go.
Just get me the details.

810
00:33:52,014 --> 00:33:55,182
I've been thinking, too-- about
your number-cruncher, Harlan.

811
00:33:55,184 --> 00:33:57,017
You think I was
too hard on him.

812
00:33:57,019 --> 00:33:58,685
You will have consultants
of your own one day.

813
00:33:58,687 --> 00:34:01,488
You'll see that they require
management and focus.

814
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:04,124
They are but keys on a keyboard,
and we're the typists.

815
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:06,159
You could've given him
a shoeing for all I care.

816
00:34:06,161 --> 00:34:07,828
No, I'm just saying that

817
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:10,030
some of the stuff he's got
up to, it's quite good.

818
00:34:10,032 --> 00:34:11,698
You should take a look.

819
00:34:13,368 --> 00:34:15,735
You may find a fellow typist.

820
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,076
Hello?

821
00:34:23,078 --> 00:34:25,312
Yeah, I
hear that you and some friends

822
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:27,848
are trying to identify
Mo Shellshocker.

823
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,649
That's right. Who is this?

824
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:32,719
His name is Harlan Emple.

825
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:34,020
You got a pen?

826
00:34:34,022 --> 00:34:36,456
I'll-I'll give you his address.

827
00:34:52,454 --> 00:34:54,020
Harlan.

828
00:34:54,022 --> 00:34:56,356
You can't take a hint, can you?

829
00:34:56,358 --> 00:34:57,657
I got your text messages.

830
00:34:57,659 --> 00:34:58,958
I don't want to see you
right now.

831
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,827
So if you came here
to apologize...

832
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:03,363
Actually, I came here
to spare you an agonizing death.

833
00:35:04,299 --> 00:35:05,832
Can I come in?

834
00:35:05,834 --> 00:35:08,301
I was puzzling earlier

835
00:35:08,303 --> 00:35:12,038
as to why the killer went
to such specific lengths.

836
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,606
What did he want?

837
00:35:13,608 --> 00:35:15,809
And then Watson,
quite by accident,

838
00:35:15,811 --> 00:35:17,410
she made a most
compelling analogy.

839
00:35:17,412 --> 00:35:20,080
She said it was as if he
was on a hunt of his own.

840
00:35:20,082 --> 00:35:22,615
Duh. He was hunting
mathematicians.

841
00:35:22,617 --> 00:35:23,783
No, he wasn't.

842
00:35:23,785 --> 00:35:25,151
He was hunting<i> a</i> mathematician.

843
00:35:25,153 --> 00:35:26,619
One.

844
00:35:26,621 --> 00:35:29,389
A man who had concealed
his identity not only

845
00:35:29,391 --> 00:35:31,191
from the mathematics
community at large,

846
00:35:31,193 --> 00:35:32,859
but also from the FBI.

847
00:35:32,861 --> 00:35:35,395
A “crusader,”
you might call him.

848
00:35:35,397 --> 00:35:36,763
Wait a minute.

849
00:35:36,765 --> 00:35:38,731
Are you saying that
this was all about me?

850
00:35:53,448 --> 00:35:56,449
<i> Unfortunately, emulating</i>
<i>the work of people like me</i>

851
00:35:56,451 --> 00:35:59,018
<i>is not without risks.</i>

852
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,320
Creates enemies.

853
00:36:00,322 --> 00:36:02,889
I knew it was the government.

854
00:36:02,891 --> 00:36:04,424
It was a lottery winner.

855
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,260
Little over a year ago,

856
00:36:07,262 --> 00:36:09,529
you started a series of blogs
where you exposed the flaws

857
00:36:09,531 --> 00:36:11,664
in certain scratch card
lottery games.

858
00:36:11,666 --> 00:36:13,766
Tickets like this one.

859
00:36:13,768 --> 00:36:15,802
I wrote about
baited hook games.

860
00:36:15,804 --> 00:36:17,971
Games where the numbers
are printed on the front.

861
00:36:17,973 --> 00:36:20,707
Scratch off the hidden numbers,
hope for a match.

862
00:36:20,709 --> 00:36:23,309
Only, you proved that with
careful mathematical analysis

863
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:25,512
of the visible numbers,
you could predict

864
00:36:25,514 --> 00:36:28,381
which tickets were winners
80% of the time.

865
00:36:28,383 --> 00:36:29,682
If you had exploited

866
00:36:29,684 --> 00:36:32,085
this flaw,
rather than exposing it,

867
00:36:32,087 --> 00:36:33,520
you could have made millions.

868
00:36:33,522 --> 00:36:36,022
Well... sure.
But that would been cheating.

869
00:36:36,024 --> 00:36:37,157
Right.

870
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:38,825
So imagine
for a moment

871
00:36:38,827 --> 00:36:41,060
that you are a less
honest mathematician.

872
00:36:41,062 --> 00:36:42,495
Right?

873
00:36:42,497 --> 00:36:44,063
You've been taking
advantage of these games

874
00:36:44,065 --> 00:36:47,967
for a couple of years to
amass a small fortune.

875
00:36:47,969 --> 00:36:49,502
And then “Mo"
comes along.

876
00:36:49,504 --> 00:36:51,971
He starts exposing
the broken games.

877
00:36:51,973 --> 00:36:54,340
State lottery commissions
shut them down.

878
00:36:54,342 --> 00:36:56,976
The exploitable
games dry up.

879
00:36:56,978 --> 00:37:00,613
Now, if you were a
psychopathic lottery cheat,

880
00:37:00,615 --> 00:37:02,582
how do you fix that?

881
00:37:02,584 --> 00:37:04,484
You kill Mo.

882
00:37:04,486 --> 00:37:07,253
<i>Unfortunately, Mo is elusive.</i>

883
00:37:07,255 --> 00:37:08,821
<i>Anonymous.</i>

884
00:37:08,823 --> 00:37:11,224
The only thing
he knew about him for sure

885
00:37:11,226 --> 00:37:14,394
was that he could not resist
a puzzle hunt.

886
00:37:14,396 --> 00:37:17,130
Now, if you were smart enough
to identify

887
00:37:17,132 --> 00:37:19,399
and take advantage of
broken lottery games...

888
00:37:19,401 --> 00:37:21,868
Then I'm smart enough
to design a puzzle hunt.

889
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:25,338
This plan was not
without its flaws.

890
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:28,775
Once a competitor
reached the terminal stage,

891
00:37:28,777 --> 00:37:32,745
the killer could not be certain
that he'd trapped Mo, could he?

892
00:37:32,747 --> 00:37:34,480
So he tortured them.

893
00:37:34,482 --> 00:37:37,083
I submit he forced them to
log on to Mo's Web site,

894
00:37:37,085 --> 00:37:39,686
and when they failed...

895
00:37:41,323 --> 00:37:42,755
After two murders,

896
00:37:42,757 --> 00:37:44,290
the game was compromised.

897
00:37:44,292 --> 00:37:46,192
So the killer devises
a Plan “B.”

898
00:37:46,194 --> 00:37:47,460
He tricks

899
00:37:47,462 --> 00:37:49,229
a group of his peers

900
00:37:49,231 --> 00:37:51,097
into helping search
for an alternative means

901
00:37:51,099 --> 00:37:53,032
of identifying Mo.

902
00:37:56,504 --> 00:37:58,438
You're talking about that guy.

903
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,906
The one with the penthouse.

904
00:37:59,908 --> 00:38:02,742
<i>Paul?</i>

905
00:38:02,744 --> 00:38:05,044
Lottery winners
are public record.

906
00:38:05,046 --> 00:38:07,814
So when I searched for
the names of repeat winners

907
00:38:07,816 --> 00:38:09,482
in the dates prior
to your posts...

908
00:38:09,484 --> 00:38:11,317
I can't believe
I drank his water.

909
00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:12,685
I called him.

910
00:38:12,687 --> 00:38:14,654
I identified you as Mo.

911
00:38:14,656 --> 00:38:16,122
And I gave him your address.

912
00:38:16,124 --> 00:38:17,590
You what?!

913
00:38:21,129 --> 00:38:23,062
Drop your weapon!

914
00:38:23,064 --> 00:38:24,597
<i>I did not, however, give him</i>

915
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:25,965
<i>the correct apartment number.</i>

916
00:38:25,967 --> 00:38:28,334
He was arrested
a little over an hour ago.

917
00:38:30,739 --> 00:38:31,871
Tried to call you to
tell you, but, um...

918
00:38:31,873 --> 00:38:33,539
But I was ignoring you.

919
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:35,008
Yes, you were ignoring me.

920
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,209
Look, you know

921
00:38:36,211 --> 00:38:37,377
that I'm still screwed, right?

922
00:38:37,379 --> 00:38:39,279
You told him that I'm Mo.

923
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:42,115
He's gonna tell the police,
they're gonna tell the FBI...

924
00:38:42,117 --> 00:38:43,516
The NYPD is under
the impression

925
00:38:43,518 --> 00:38:45,385
that I lied about
your connection to Mo

926
00:38:45,387 --> 00:38:47,920
in order to draw
Mr. Ettinger out.

927
00:38:47,922 --> 00:38:49,555
As far as the
FBI goes, well,

928
00:38:49,557 --> 00:38:51,958
I've got some associates
who have created a trail

929
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,860
which will
strongly suggest that Mo

930
00:38:53,862 --> 00:38:55,728
is a cyber-terrorist
I became aware of

931
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:58,197
whilst working for, um...

932
00:38:58,199 --> 00:38:59,766
queen and country.

933
00:38:59,768 --> 00:39:02,135
Your secret's
quite safe.

934
00:39:02,137 --> 00:39:03,903
Thanks.

935
00:39:06,508 --> 00:39:09,776
My reasons for preserving you
are entirely selfish, Harlan.

936
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:13,279
You are a tremendous asset.

937
00:39:13,281 --> 00:39:15,815
I have little doubt

938
00:39:15,817 --> 00:39:19,118
I will need your help again
in the future.

939
00:39:26,461 --> 00:39:28,528
Me or him?

940
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:29,996
You.

941
00:39:29,998 --> 00:39:31,798
I have an update on
that real estate flipper.

942
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,433
I thought you might
want to know.

943
00:39:39,274 --> 00:39:41,908
I tracked down the truck rental
receipts to get her name.

944
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,142
Valerie Cork.

945
00:39:43,144 --> 00:39:44,911
She's an art authenticator.

946
00:39:44,913 --> 00:39:46,779
And that crate you saw?

947
00:39:46,781 --> 00:39:48,414
There was
something called

948
00:39:48,416 --> 00:39:50,683
a scanning fluorescence
spectrometry machine inside.

949
00:39:50,685 --> 00:39:52,251
They're used...
To find paintings

950
00:39:52,253 --> 00:39:53,553
underneath other paintings.

951
00:39:53,555 --> 00:39:55,288
So it turns out
that the building

952
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:56,689
Chad Keswick was looking to buy

953
00:39:56,691 --> 00:39:59,025
was leased by the WPA
during the Depression.

954
00:39:59,027 --> 00:40:00,927
They commissioned a
mural for the lobby.

955
00:40:00,929 --> 00:40:03,329
The artist was a
notorious communist,

956
00:40:03,331 --> 00:40:05,365
so when the property passed
into private hands in the '50s,

957
00:40:05,367 --> 00:40:06,999
the new owners
had it painted over.

958
00:40:07,001 --> 00:40:08,735
But it was still there,
under the paint.

959
00:40:08,737 --> 00:40:11,037
A lost work by Diego Rivera.

960
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:13,473
It's worth ten times
the price of the building.

961
00:40:14,676 --> 00:40:17,043
I was hoping to leak
the truth to the<i> Times.</i>

962
00:40:18,113 --> 00:40:20,046
I promised you a cut of my fee.

963
00:40:20,048 --> 00:40:22,148
But I'm pretty sure
the mural's gonna end up

964
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:24,384
in the hands of
a historical trust.

965
00:40:24,386 --> 00:40:26,352
I'd feel obligated
to refund my client,

966
00:40:26,354 --> 00:40:28,388
which means you'd get
a cut of nothing.

967
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:31,457
That works for me.

968
00:40:31,459 --> 00:40:33,493
Okay.

969
00:40:35,463 --> 00:40:37,397
I think you should know

970
00:40:37,399 --> 00:40:39,732
that I am going
to a meeting tonight.

971
00:40:41,803 --> 00:40:45,505
One of those
support groups for...

972
00:40:45,507 --> 00:40:47,340
people like me.

973
00:40:47,342 --> 00:40:49,876
It was, uh, Sherlock's idea.

974
00:40:49,878 --> 00:40:51,644
That's great.

975
00:40:51,646 --> 00:40:53,446
I know you put him up to it.

976
00:40:53,448 --> 00:40:55,381
We talked.

977
00:40:57,552 --> 00:41:00,219
When he first approached me
in London,

978
00:41:00,221 --> 00:41:03,556
I was...

979
00:41:03,558 --> 00:41:05,558
in a bad way.

980
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,227
And I had been for a while.

981
00:41:08,229 --> 00:41:11,130
But then,
when he talked about

982
00:41:11,132 --> 00:41:12,365
the work that he did,

983
00:41:12,367 --> 00:41:16,035
about the things
that he saw in me...

984
00:41:18,406 --> 00:41:19,739
I want it.

985
00:41:19,741 --> 00:41:21,874
I want every bit
of what's he offered me,

986
00:41:21,876 --> 00:41:23,843
of what he offered you, but...

987
00:41:23,845 --> 00:41:26,212
if I've learned one thing
over the last few weeks,

988
00:41:26,214 --> 00:41:28,047
it's that he can't pull it off.

989
00:41:28,049 --> 00:41:29,682
Not by himself, anyway.

990
00:41:31,586 --> 00:41:34,153
And if I'm gonna get
what I want,

991
00:41:34,155 --> 00:41:37,690
then I'm going to need
your help, too.

992
00:41:40,361 --> 00:41:42,829
I still think
the meetings are bollocks,

993
00:41:42,831 --> 00:41:44,931
but you say they're important.

994
00:41:44,933 --> 00:41:47,967
They matter to you, so...

995
00:41:47,969 --> 00:41:49,735
What do you say, Watson?

996
00:41:49,737 --> 00:41:52,071
Will you help me?

997
00:41:56,277 --> 00:41:58,244
I don't know how it happened.

998
00:41:58,246 --> 00:42:01,547
It just... hit me.

999
00:42:01,549 --> 00:42:03,983
Like a truck, out of nowhere.

1000
00:42:04,853 --> 00:42:07,753
Work is good.

1001
00:42:07,755 --> 00:42:09,755
I have friends.

1002
00:42:09,757 --> 00:42:13,092
I'm in a
relationship.

1003
00:42:13,094 --> 00:42:16,896
Somewhere along
the way, somehow,

1004
00:42:16,898 --> 00:42:19,732
I stopped being a victim

1005
00:42:19,734 --> 00:42:22,602
and became a survivor.

1006
00:42:22,604 --> 00:42:25,705
So, I guess all I'm saying is,
there's hope.

1007
00:42:26,357 --> 00:42:31,686
Do the work. Love yourself.
There's hope.

<i>Previously on</i> Elementary...

00:00:03,422 --> 00:00:04,761
If you're looking for Sherlock,
he's downstairs.

3
00:00:04,785 --> 00:00:05,841
Okay.

4
00:00:05,842 --> 00:00:07,541
<i>His name is Harlan Emple.</i>

5
00:00:07,543 --> 00:00:09,176
<i>He is the Rachel P. Hanson</i>
<i>Professor</i>

6
00:00:09,178 --> 00:00:11,301
for Applied Mathematics
at Columbia University.

7
00:00:11,301 --> 00:00:14,502
What I don't get is
why he isn't wearing a shirt.

8
00:00:14,504 --> 00:00:17,372
He doesn't like anything to come
between him and the numbers.

9
00:00:17,374 --> 00:00:18,415
What is it?

10
00:00:18,438 --> 00:00:20,274
The answers to your questions
about Kitty.

11
00:00:20,276 --> 00:00:22,710
The truth is she was a
victim of a horrific crime.

12
00:00:22,712 --> 00:00:24,646
<i>After you left last night,</i>

13
00:00:24,648 --> 00:00:26,848
Sherlock gave me an envelope.

14
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,249
Sherlock keeps saying

15
00:00:28,251 --> 00:00:30,385
that I need to get
a better sense of you,

16
00:00:30,387 --> 00:00:33,021
and maybe that will give you
a better sense of me.

17
00:00:42,065 --> 00:00:43,065
It's open.

18
00:00:47,637 --> 00:00:49,003
It's nothing.

19
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:50,872
It's Sherlock and
one of his experts.

20
00:00:50,874 --> 00:00:52,006
Which one?

21
00:00:52,008 --> 00:00:53,241
Phillip something.

22
00:00:53,243 --> 00:00:54,575
Must be new.

23
00:00:54,577 --> 00:00:57,445
He's a knife-thrower.

24
00:00:57,447 --> 00:00:58,913
Why does Sherlock have
a knife-thrower?

25
00:00:58,915 --> 00:01:00,748
He got bored the other day,

26
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,185
started looking into this, uh,
circus accident from the '30s.

27
00:01:04,187 --> 00:01:07,922
The Great Galardo perforated one
of his assistants during an act,

28
00:01:07,924 --> 00:01:09,924
except Sherlock thinks
the blade was thrown

29
00:01:09,926 --> 00:01:11,492
by somebody in the stands,
not Galardo.

30
00:01:11,494 --> 00:01:15,096
Phillip, as far as I
can tell, disagrees.

31
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:18,900
It can't be done, okay?

32
00:01:18,902 --> 00:01:19,934
It was done.

33
00:01:19,936 --> 00:01:21,335
You're wrong.

34
00:01:21,337 --> 00:01:23,538
Nobody can chuck
a knife that far.

35
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,239
What's this?

36
00:01:25,241 --> 00:01:26,207
You're...

37
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:27,209
Not here.

38
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,509
I'm not here.

39
00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:29,711
Remember that, okay?

40
00:01:29,713 --> 00:01:31,279
Oh, yes. Heaven
forfend your work

41
00:01:31,281 --> 00:01:33,247
with me should endanger
your precious day job.

42
00:01:33,249 --> 00:01:35,116
You throw knives?

43
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,252
You know, it was supposed
to be just you here.

44
00:01:38,254 --> 00:01:41,355
Phillip is arguably the greatest
knife-thrower in the world.

45
00:01:41,357 --> 00:01:42,790
Has been for decades.

46
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:43,925
Only, there's little money

47
00:01:43,927 --> 00:01:45,193
to be made
in the impalement arts.

48
00:01:45,195 --> 00:01:46,494
So, as a youth, he turned

49
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,563
to what you Americans
term “football”"

50
00:01:48,565 --> 00:01:50,131
Is this a joke?

51
00:01:53,837 --> 00:01:55,002
Phillip, head
and heart.

52
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:56,904
Come on.
Head and heart.

53
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:06,814
Can I go?

54
00:02:06,816 --> 00:02:09,484
Yeah.

55
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,489
15 years he spent throwing
that misshapen ball around.

56
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:16,057
15 years.

57
00:02:16,059 --> 00:02:18,259
When I think of the acclaim
he could have brought

58
00:02:18,261 --> 00:02:20,828
to competitive blade slinging.

59
00:02:27,237 --> 00:02:29,036
You're following me,
Watson.

60
00:02:29,038 --> 00:02:30,338
I don't like it.

61
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,740
I want you to help
me with something.

62
00:02:32,742 --> 00:02:33,908
This is Chad Keswick.

63
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,976
He buys distressed
buildings,

64
00:02:34,978 --> 00:02:36,210
paints, spackles,

65
00:02:36,212 --> 00:02:37,645
and then flips them
for quick money.

66
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:39,180
Who'd he kill?
No one.

67
00:02:39,182 --> 00:02:41,315
I was hired by one of
his rivals to find out

68
00:02:41,317 --> 00:02:43,017
why he's been circling
this old office building

69
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:44,218
in Jamaica, Queens.

70
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,586
She wants to know
why he thinks

71
00:02:45,588 --> 00:02:47,355
the building is
a good investment.

72
00:02:47,357 --> 00:02:49,590
Is there a crime in there,
something worth investigating?

73
00:02:49,592 --> 00:02:50,925
Well, I've been
shadowing Keswick,

74
00:02:50,927 --> 00:02:52,593
but yesterday I think
he noticed me.

75
00:02:52,595 --> 00:02:54,595
I want to switch
up the tail.

76
00:02:54,597 --> 00:02:57,231
You followed me for over
a week before I noticed you.

77
00:02:57,233 --> 00:02:59,033
Help me out, and I'll
cut you in on my fee.

78
00:02:59,035 --> 00:03:02,003
I don't work for you,
I work for Sherlock.

79
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:03,437
I worked for him, too.

80
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,773
And, in my experience,
he was always supportive

81
00:03:05,775 --> 00:03:07,942
of taking on work
outside the partnership.

82
00:03:07,944 --> 00:03:10,912
Sorry, it's not my cup of tea.

as “extremely agitated.”

104
00:05:14,518 --> 00:05:15,984
Well, of course
I was agitated.

105

Can I borrow those?

00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:31,100
This...

110
00:05:31,102 --> 00:05:33,302
is Belphegor's Prime, okay?

111
00:05:33,304 --> 00:05:35,304
It's a numeric palindrome.

112
00:05:35,306 --> 00:05:40,776
It's 666 bookended by 13 zeroes
and then bracketed with ones.

113
00:05:40,778 --> 00:05:43,846
Named for the demon Belphegor
who was a prince of hell.

114
00:05:43,848 --> 00:05:46,448
The first clue for the hunt
started making the rounds

115
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,883
a few months ago.

116
00:05:47,885 --> 00:05:49,651
It was a JPEG with two numbers
hidden in it.

117
00:05:49,653 --> 00:05:51,453
You divide those numbers
by Belphegor's Prime,

118
00:05:51,455 --> 00:05:54,890
and you get the GPS coordinates
for a restroom at the Bronx Zoo.

119
00:05:54,892 --> 00:05:56,959
You go to the restroom,
you find a phone number.

120
00:05:56,961 --> 00:05:58,927
You send a text to the number,
you get the next clue.

121
00:05:58,929 --> 00:05:59,962
Which is another math problem.

122
00:05:59,964 --> 00:06:00,929
Exactly.

123
00:06:00,931 --> 00:06:02,397
Only, this one is harder.

124
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,099
And that's how it works.

125
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:05,934
You know, but for
each one that you solve,

126
00:06:05,936 --> 00:06:08,103
you get a new set
of GPS coordinates.

127
00:06:08,105 --> 00:06:11,473
And that means that you've
completed a stage, or a portal.

128
00:06:11,475 --> 00:06:13,509
And last night,
I was on Portal Ten.

129
00:06:13,511 --> 00:06:15,711
And...

130
00:06:17,014 --> 00:06:18,313
You know what?

131
00:06:18,315 --> 00:06:20,015
I want to talk
to Sherlock and Joan.

132
00:06:20,017 --> 00:06:21,917
Look, Mr. Emple...
No, I'm sorry.

133
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,019
I told the police down
at the factory that I know them.

134
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:25,287
Isn't that the whole reason

135
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:26,922
that I was brought here
to this squad?

136
00:06:26,924 --> 00:06:30,392
I-I am not saying another word
until they are here.

137
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:35,264
Harlan Emple is
indeed an acquaintance.

138
00:06:35,266 --> 00:06:37,733
He is, in point of fact,
one of my “irregulars.”

139
00:06:37,735 --> 00:06:38,801
One of your what?

140
00:06:38,803 --> 00:06:40,302
Irregulars.

141
00:06:40,304 --> 00:06:41,770
I'm your consultant, Captain;
they are mine.

142
00:06:41,772 --> 00:06:43,572
They're a handful
of experts I turn to

143
00:06:43,574 --> 00:06:46,108
when I encounter problems which
are beyond my pool of knowledge.

144
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,810
Harlan is
a brilliant mathematician.

145
00:06:47,812 --> 00:06:49,778
And on the handful of occasions
I have tackled a case

146
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,046
which pertained
to mathematics...

147
00:06:51,048 --> 00:06:53,182
He helped you out.
Well, the good news

148
00:06:53,184 --> 00:06:56,018
for him is the preliminary
autopsy report just came in

149
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,252
before you got here.

150
00:06:57,254 --> 00:06:59,021
And the M.E. puts
the time of death

151
00:06:59,023 --> 00:07:00,989
between 4:00 and
6:00 p.m. last night.

152
00:07:00,991 --> 00:07:02,124
Mr. Emple was teaching

153
00:07:02,126 --> 00:07:03,358
a class at Columbia.

154
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,394
So the victim is
yet to be identified?

155
00:07:05,396 --> 00:07:07,663
No I.D., no phone.

156
00:07:07,665 --> 00:07:09,865
First detective on the scene
liked it for a mob hit,

157
00:07:09,867 --> 00:07:11,500
so while we're
running the prints,

158
00:07:11,502 --> 00:07:13,602
he's showing the vic's
face around OCID.

159
00:07:13,604 --> 00:07:16,839
Marcus here was about to walk
the scene with Mr. Emple.

160
00:07:16,841 --> 00:07:18,774
You're here now;
you might as well tag along.

161
00:07:18,776 --> 00:07:21,009
Actually, Captain,
I'm quite busy today.

162
00:07:21,011 --> 00:07:22,978
This is a John Doe,
and we got nothing.

163
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,247
And, like you just said,
you're my consultant.

164
00:07:25,249 --> 00:07:26,748
So, go consult.

165
00:07:29,787 --> 00:07:30,986
Watson.

166
00:07:30,988 --> 00:07:32,588
Um, he's your friend.

167
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,523
Actually, Kitty is
otherwise engaged,

168
00:07:34,525 --> 00:07:37,426
and he did actually help both
of us with a case last year.

169
00:07:37,428 --> 00:07:38,493
Did he not?

170
00:07:40,865 --> 00:07:44,099
Have I told you
how good it is to see you?

171
00:07:44,101 --> 00:07:45,367
Yes, you have.
Three times.

172
00:07:45,369 --> 00:07:46,468
Well, it is.

173
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,636
Hey, lousy circumstances.

174
00:07:47,638 --> 00:07:49,371
But, uh, hey...

175
00:07:49,373 --> 00:07:51,740
I heard from your boss that you
just, uh, got back from London.

176
00:07:51,742 --> 00:07:53,308
Were you working
a case or...?

177
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,576
No, I moved back there.

178
00:07:54,578 --> 00:07:55,677
You mean<i> moved,</i> moved?

179
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:56,845
Is there another
definition?

180
00:07:56,847 --> 00:07:58,513
I was there for
eight months,

181
00:07:58,515 --> 00:08:00,883
and had a change of heart
and returned to New York.

182
00:08:00,885 --> 00:08:02,517
So, you moved to London,
and you didn't, uh...

183
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,086
You know what?
Doesn't even matter.

184
00:08:04,088 --> 00:08:05,387
The point is you're back!

185
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:07,389
Mr. Emple.
Uh, duty calls.

186
00:08:07,391 --> 00:08:09,024
Yeah.

187
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:18,634
It's interesting.

188
00:08:18,636 --> 00:08:20,068
Mothballs are interesting?

189
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,070
They were taken from
that cabinet over there.

190
00:08:22,072 --> 00:08:25,941
Obviously, to cover the smell
of John Doe's decay.

191
00:08:25,943 --> 00:08:28,043
The killer didn't
bring them with him.

192
00:08:28,045 --> 00:08:31,179
Perhaps leaving the body here
was not part of his plan, hmm?

193
00:08:32,983 --> 00:08:36,018
Doe was shot in the foot
first and then the knee.

194
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,453
Either those were
two really bad misses or...

195
00:08:38,455 --> 00:08:41,256
Or the killer was torturing him.

196
00:08:41,258 --> 00:08:43,892
This doesn't seem like anything
you can't handle on your own.

197
00:08:43,894 --> 00:08:45,994
So you want to tell me why you
really asked me to come here?

198
00:08:45,996 --> 00:08:48,363
“This doesn't seem like anything
you can't handle on your own.”

199
00:08:48,365 --> 00:08:49,765
That's funny.

200
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:51,566
That's exactly what
I would have said

201
00:08:51,568 --> 00:08:53,602
had I been present when you
asked Kitty for her assistance

202
00:08:53,604 --> 00:08:54,937
with your tawdry side job.

203
00:08:54,939 --> 00:08:57,372
“Tawdry”?
I wanted you to know I approve.

204
00:08:57,374 --> 00:08:59,007
Of what?

205
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:01,376
Your agenda
with regards to Kitty.

206
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:03,078
Several days ago,
I gave you her file.

207
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,913
And then you show up at
the brownstone yesterday,

208
00:09:04,915 --> 00:09:06,515
and you invite her
into an investigation.

209
00:09:06,517 --> 00:09:08,183
Coincidence? No, I think not.

210
00:09:08,185 --> 00:09:11,320
You feel for her.
And now you wish to engage.

211
00:09:11,322 --> 00:09:13,956
It's not an outcome
I would have predicted, no.

212
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,458
But it is one
I approve of, yeah.

213
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,193
She could learn
a great deal from you,

214
00:09:18,195 --> 00:09:20,228
especially with regards
to how to get the most

215
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,864
from my tutelage.

216
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:25,734
So, I've already dispatched her
to, uh, follow your Mr. Keswick.

217
00:09:25,736 --> 00:09:27,836
But that's not
what I actually...

218
00:09:27,838 --> 00:09:29,404
Harlan!

219
00:09:30,741 --> 00:09:33,075
You came here to retrieve
a phone number, did you not?

220
00:09:33,077 --> 00:09:34,609
You would send a text,
and then receive

221
00:09:34,611 --> 00:09:36,845
the next clue in the game
that you were playing.

222
00:09:36,847 --> 00:09:38,747
Yeah, but I didn't find it.

223
00:09:38,749 --> 00:09:40,048
Not that I kept looking

224
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,250
after the dead guy
fell out of the locker.

225
00:09:42,252 --> 00:09:44,052
Yeah, CSU didn't find
any number either.

226
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:46,154
Probably because
it's under that paint.

227
00:09:46,156 --> 00:09:48,190
It's fresh.

228
00:09:48,192 --> 00:09:49,891
Applied in the last

229
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:52,694
24 hours.

230
00:09:52,696 --> 00:09:54,696
Right after John Doe's murder,
I'd wager.

231
00:09:54,698 --> 00:09:57,099
You don't think
this was a mob hit?

232
00:09:57,101 --> 00:09:59,101
Doe and the killer were
playing the game, too.

233
00:09:59,103 --> 00:10:01,203
The killer shot Doe and
then covered up the number

234
00:10:01,205 --> 00:10:02,704
so no one else could use it.

235
00:10:02,706 --> 00:10:04,806
What's the prize
in your little contest?

236
00:10:04,808 --> 00:10:07,576
Well, I'm doing it
mostly for the math.

237
00:10:07,578 --> 00:10:11,480
But, uh, $1,707,071.

238
00:10:11,482 --> 00:10:13,882
It's another
palindromic prime.

239
00:10:13,884 --> 00:10:17,152
Did I not mention the
money at the station?

240
00:10:17,154 --> 00:10:18,587
Who the hell can afford

241
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:20,655
that kind of payout
for a puzzle hunt?

242
00:10:20,657 --> 00:10:22,124
Well, most people
think it's CAML.

243
00:10:22,126 --> 00:10:24,593
The Center for Applied
Mathematics and Logic.

244
00:10:24,595 --> 00:10:26,094
It's located
in Ramapo...

245
00:10:26,096 --> 00:10:27,729
Wait, most people
“think” it's them?

246
00:10:27,731 --> 00:10:29,331
Well, hunts like these,

247
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,266
the organizers are
almost always anonymous.

248
00:10:31,268 --> 00:10:32,401
It's S.O.P.

249
00:10:32,403 --> 00:10:34,302
What about the
contestants?

250
00:10:34,304 --> 00:10:37,005
Is anonymity
also S.O.P.?

251
00:10:37,007 --> 00:10:39,207
For the most part, yeah.

252
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:43,078
But, guys, math peeps
are my peeps, okay?

253
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,314
It's, uh, like
a community, sort of.

254
00:10:46,316 --> 00:10:48,984
I can think of ten
or 12 other people

255
00:10:48,986 --> 00:10:50,018
who were probably competing.

256
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,186
Would that help?

257
00:10:53,157 --> 00:10:55,223
No.

258
00:10:55,225 --> 00:10:58,026
I'm sorry, I don't know him.

259
00:10:58,028 --> 00:11:00,862
But you admit you were
competing in Belphegor's Prime.

260
00:11:00,864 --> 00:11:02,197
I do.

261
00:11:04,835 --> 00:11:05,934
Pepe!

262
00:11:08,172 --> 00:11:10,439
Sorry. He doesn't
like strangers.

263
00:11:12,109 --> 00:11:14,443
Give him one of these.

264
00:11:14,445 --> 00:11:16,111
Get on his good side.

265
00:11:24,288 --> 00:11:26,354
What are you doing?

266
00:11:28,225 --> 00:11:30,725
I'm just verifying that
you've been lying to us.

267
00:11:30,727 --> 00:11:33,895
You did know the
dead man, did you not?

268
00:11:33,897 --> 00:11:36,998
I reviewed his personal
effects at the morgue earlier.

269
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,034
The coroner reported finding
crumbs in one of his pockets.

270
00:11:39,036 --> 00:11:40,036
I tasted one.

271
00:11:40,037 --> 00:11:41,269
Why would you...?

272
00:11:41,271 --> 00:11:42,771
At first, I thought
they were from

273
00:11:42,773 --> 00:11:44,439
a particularly rancid
brand of cheese,

274
00:11:44,441 --> 00:11:47,609
but, no... they're from
one of Pepe's treats.

275
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:49,277
Homemade?

276
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,481
Harlan was able to give us
the names of nine other people

277
00:11:52,483 --> 00:11:54,149
he believed to be
other competitors.

278
00:11:54,151 --> 00:11:55,984
Our colleagues are
investigating them as we speak,

279
00:11:55,986 --> 00:11:57,919
but I'll quite happily
recommend that the NYPD

280
00:11:57,921 --> 00:12:00,222
focus its attention
entirely on you.

281
00:12:04,128 --> 00:12:06,428
His name was Ike Walaczek.

282
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,231
In another lifetime,
he was my boyfriend.

283
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:10,866
And what of
this lifetime?

284
00:12:10,868 --> 00:12:12,701
We were working together.

285
00:12:12,703 --> 00:12:14,769
On Belphegor's.
What?!

286
00:12:14,771 --> 00:12:16,705
He was a numerical analyst
at the Tory Foundation.

287
00:12:16,707 --> 00:12:17,873
I work mostly in combinatorics.

288
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,307
I thought we would make
a good team.

289
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:20,742
But there aren't
supposed to be teams.

290
00:12:20,744 --> 00:12:22,711
Not in a puzzle hunt.
It's bad form.

291
00:12:22,713 --> 00:12:23,713
Harlan...

292
00:12:23,714 --> 00:12:25,514
I'm just saying...

293
00:12:25,516 --> 00:12:27,315
My husband
wouldn't understand,

294
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:30,385
so I decided I wouldn't tell him
until after we won the money.

295
00:12:30,387 --> 00:12:33,121
A team-- so that's how
you got there before me.

296
00:12:33,123 --> 00:12:34,489
I wasn't there.

297
00:12:34,491 --> 00:12:36,258
Tom and I were out of town
until this morning.

298
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,126
His cousin
was getting married in Hawaii.

299
00:12:38,128 --> 00:12:40,662
That's why Ike went
to the coordinates by himself.

300
00:12:40,664 --> 00:12:42,097
Because I couldn't.

301
00:12:44,268 --> 00:12:46,601
These are pictures I took.

302
00:12:46,603 --> 00:12:49,337
Check the dates.

303
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:51,506
You gave the police
nine other names?

304
00:12:51,508 --> 00:12:53,408
People you thought
were competing?

305
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,776
I've got 16.

306
00:12:54,778 --> 00:12:56,311
And I know they were competing.

307
00:12:58,448 --> 00:13:01,249
He talked to her
outside the Jamaica property

308
00:13:01,251 --> 00:13:05,720
for about 20 minutes,
and then this truck rolled up.

309
00:13:05,722 --> 00:13:07,822
Any idea what's
inside the crate?

310
00:13:07,824 --> 00:13:09,024
Nope.

311
00:13:09,026 --> 00:13:10,392
I can't identify
the woman either.

312
00:13:10,394 --> 00:13:12,260
Everything about her
said money though.

313
00:13:12,262 --> 00:13:15,363
She, Keswick
and the mystery box

314
00:13:15,365 --> 00:13:17,732
stayed inside the building
for about three hours,

315
00:13:17,734 --> 00:13:20,001
and then off they went.

316
00:13:20,904 --> 00:13:22,170
Good.

317
00:13:22,172 --> 00:13:23,872
Okay.

318
00:13:23,874 --> 00:13:26,074
You know where
to send the check.

319
00:13:26,076 --> 00:13:30,145
You haven't asked me about
the file Sherlock gave me.

320
00:13:30,147 --> 00:13:32,080
Why would I?

321
00:13:32,082 --> 00:13:36,184
You said it would give me
a better sense of you-- it did.

322
00:13:37,588 --> 00:13:40,155
That's why you asked
for my help.

323
00:13:40,157 --> 00:13:41,990
Because you felt sorry for me.

324
00:13:41,992 --> 00:13:44,226
No.

325
00:13:44,228 --> 00:13:46,194
You just don't seem interested
in anything

326
00:13:46,196 --> 00:13:48,063
outside of becoming
a detective.

327
00:13:48,065 --> 00:13:50,999
There she is.

328
00:13:51,001 --> 00:13:53,301
The old counselor.

329
00:13:53,303 --> 00:13:55,637
Who used to hold
Sherlock's hand.

330
00:13:57,608 --> 00:13:59,741
Everything that you read,

331
00:13:59,743 --> 00:14:02,510
everything that happened to me,
that's all it is.

332
00:14:02,512 --> 00:14:04,646
It's just something
that happened.

333
00:14:04,648 --> 00:14:08,116
And it's all
in the past now.

334
00:14:08,118 --> 00:14:10,685
So let's just
leave it there, shall we?

335
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:24,667
Hello.

336
00:14:24,668 --> 00:14:26,001
You've had sex.

337
00:14:26,003 --> 00:14:27,202
Excuse me?

338
00:14:27,204 --> 00:14:28,503
I can hear it
in your voice.

339
00:14:28,505 --> 00:14:29,771
You've joined paunches.

340
00:14:29,773 --> 00:14:30,972
Good for you, Watson.

341
00:14:30,974 --> 00:14:32,807
As you know, I think
the act of love

342
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:34,676
can be quite conducive to...
What do you want?

343
00:14:34,678 --> 00:14:36,911
Merely to apprise you
of a new development

344
00:14:36,913 --> 00:14:38,280
in the murder of
Ike Walaczek.

345
00:14:38,282 --> 00:14:40,115
As I informed
you yesterday,

346
00:14:40,117 --> 00:14:42,284
Harlan and I were given
a new list of competitors.

347
00:14:42,286 --> 00:14:45,320
One name leapt out:
Byron Lowenthal.

348
00:14:45,322 --> 00:14:48,156
He's a statistician at the
Public Utilities Commission

349
00:14:48,158 --> 00:14:50,425
and a diagnosed
paranoid schizophrenic.

350
00:14:50,427 --> 00:14:52,160
He's been hospitalized
for becoming violent

351
00:14:52,162 --> 00:14:53,728
on no fewer
than three occasions.

352
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,964
Certainly sounds like
it could be our guy.

353
00:14:55,966 --> 00:14:59,367
Unfortunately, Mr. Lowenthal had
another break earlier this year.

354
00:14:59,369 --> 00:15:02,137
He's been staying in
a transient hotel ever since.

355
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:04,239
Detective Bell and I
are going to speak with him.

356
00:15:04,241 --> 00:15:05,307
You want me to meet you?

357
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:06,875
Oh, no, we're already here.

358
00:15:06,877 --> 00:15:08,410
Anyway, now that I know
that you've enjoyed coitus

359
00:15:08,412 --> 00:15:09,778
and could enjoy more
in the near future...

360
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,846
When you're done,
we need to talk.

361
00:15:14,718 --> 00:15:16,818
Byron Lowenthal,
you in there?

362
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,053
Who is it?

363
00:15:18,055 --> 00:15:19,754
It's Detective Bell, NYPD.

364
00:15:19,756 --> 00:15:22,257
My colleague and I would like
to ask you some questions.

365
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:24,592
Let me
get some pants on.

366
00:15:37,341 --> 00:15:40,008
S-Sorry, I just... I, um...

367
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,310
I-I thought I heard
Mr. Lowenthal retr...

368
00:16:19,154 --> 00:16:21,267
You guys got lucky.

369
00:16:21,268 --> 00:16:22,868
Well, luck had little
to do with it, actually.

370
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,536
I... I heard Mr. Lowenthal

371
00:16:24,538 --> 00:16:27,039
pulling a heavy object off
a shelf, placing it on his bed,

372
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,041
and the sound of
the zipper indicated

373
00:16:29,043 --> 00:16:30,976
that it was
a large gun case.

374
00:16:30,978 --> 00:16:33,579
Looks like he was sane enough
to do math, but not much else.

375
00:16:33,581 --> 00:16:34,747
Plus, he was
pretty hopped up.

376
00:16:34,749 --> 00:16:36,448
Caffeine pills,
energy drinks,

377
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,251
pretty much every legal
stimulant you can buy.

378
00:16:39,253 --> 00:16:40,853
Plus a few illegal ones.

379
00:16:40,855 --> 00:16:42,821
Hmm. Obviously, he was
keeping himself awake

380
00:16:42,823 --> 00:16:44,490
so he could work on
Belphegor's.

381
00:16:44,492 --> 00:16:47,392
This... is obvious to you?

382
00:16:47,394 --> 00:16:48,961
I confess the maths
are beyond me,

383
00:16:48,963 --> 00:16:51,130
but I took the liberty of
sending pictures of what

384
00:16:51,132 --> 00:16:52,865
appear to be Mr. Lowenthal's
most recent scribbles

385
00:16:52,867 --> 00:16:54,166
to Harlan Emple,
and he's confirmed

386
00:16:54,168 --> 00:16:55,667
they are part of the contest.

387
00:16:55,669 --> 00:16:56,969
With your permission,
I'd like copies of these

388
00:16:56,971 --> 00:16:58,837
sent to my home
so he can review them.

389
00:16:58,839 --> 00:16:59,972
What for?

390
00:16:59,974 --> 00:17:01,073
If Byron Lowenthal

391
00:17:01,075 --> 00:17:02,441
did kill Ike Walaczek,

392
00:17:02,443 --> 00:17:04,109
then he used
and obscured a phone number,

393
00:17:04,111 --> 00:17:05,878
which would have yielded
the next problem.

394
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,379
That problem's solution

395
00:17:07,381 --> 00:17:08,714
would be GPS coordinates.

396
00:17:08,716 --> 00:17:10,415
If he's recorded them
in his books...

397
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:12,551
Your pal will be able to tell us
where he's headed next.

398
00:17:12,553 --> 00:17:14,853
I'll get our guys to give you

399
00:17:14,855 --> 00:17:16,388
whatever you need.

400
00:17:17,258 --> 00:17:18,991
Scans are still coming through,

401
00:17:18,993 --> 00:17:21,260
but I've put what we've got
so far up on the wall.

402
00:17:21,262 --> 00:17:23,262
Sherlock said that
you prefer it that way.

403
00:17:23,264 --> 00:17:25,030
Picked it up from him,
actually.

404
00:17:25,032 --> 00:17:28,600
Makes me feel like I'm really
inside of the problem.

405
00:17:30,704 --> 00:17:33,372
I'll, uh, let you know
if I need anything.

406
00:17:34,275 --> 00:17:35,974
Oh, I work without a shirt.

407
00:17:35,976 --> 00:17:38,911
Sometimes makes me feel
closer to the numbers.

408
00:17:38,913 --> 00:17:42,147
You'll need to, uh,
check the printer in the study

409
00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:43,615
for more pages.

410
00:17:43,617 --> 00:17:45,417
Uh, this is nice,
you know?

411
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:47,452
Meeting another member
of the team.

412
00:17:47,454 --> 00:17:48,654
You know, Team Sherlock.

413
00:17:48,656 --> 00:17:50,656
You help him, I help him...

414
00:17:51,926 --> 00:17:53,559
Obviously, you haven't
tackled a case

415
00:17:53,561 --> 00:17:55,093
with high-order math since
you started working with him,

416
00:17:55,095 --> 00:17:57,729
or we would've...

417
00:17:57,731 --> 00:17:59,031
What?

418
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:00,232
What?

419
00:18:00,234 --> 00:18:01,834
Wait...

420
00:18:01,836 --> 00:18:04,002
have you worked a case
with high-order math?

421
00:18:04,805 --> 00:18:06,238
You have, haven't you?

422
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,840
Does it matter?

423
00:18:07,842 --> 00:18:09,842
Of course it...

424
00:18:09,844 --> 00:18:11,443
Oh, my God.

425
00:18:11,445 --> 00:18:13,278
Did he fire me?

426
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,980
All I know
is that back in London,

427
00:18:14,982 --> 00:18:16,982
we worked a case that involved
Fibonacci spirals...

428
00:18:16,984 --> 00:18:18,483
He fired me.

429
00:18:18,485 --> 00:18:21,386
...and he called some woman
named Indira Patel.

430
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,856
She's at Berkeley.

431
00:18:23,858 --> 00:18:25,624
I'm three time zones closer!

432
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:27,125
You're here now.

433
00:18:27,127 --> 00:18:29,428
Sure, because I found
a dead body.

434
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,531
I have to go; I have to run
some errands for Sherlock.

435
00:18:35,936 --> 00:18:37,903
I-I don't know
what was in the crate,

436
00:18:37,905 --> 00:18:39,271
but the stenciling on
the side indicates

437
00:18:39,273 --> 00:18:40,772
it came from one of
the SUNY schools.

438
00:18:40,774 --> 00:18:42,908
I put another detective
on Keswick...

439
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:45,177
Don't kill me, I had to
use your razor to shave.

440
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:47,179
I...

441
00:18:47,181 --> 00:18:49,147
You must be Andrew.

442
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:50,515
Sherlock Holmes.

443
00:18:50,517 --> 00:18:52,551
Sorry.

444
00:18:52,553 --> 00:18:55,487
Joan said you were coming;
I... I forgot.

445
00:18:55,489 --> 00:18:57,122
It's not how
I wanted to meet you.

446
00:18:57,124 --> 00:18:58,891
She said you can tell
a lot about people

447
00:18:58,893 --> 00:19:00,192
just by looking at them.

448
00:19:00,194 --> 00:19:02,261
I swear, I...
usually wear pants.

449
00:19:02,263 --> 00:19:03,729
Well, in my experience,
most people

450
00:19:03,731 --> 00:19:05,264
need only be concerned
I won't notice

451
00:19:05,266 --> 00:19:06,498
anything worth remarking upon.

452
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:10,535
Watson seems adequately sexed.

453
00:19:11,939 --> 00:19:13,672
Hey.

454
00:19:13,674 --> 00:19:15,674
I was just introducing myself.

455
00:19:17,945 --> 00:19:20,379
I've got that thing.
I'll see you tonight.

456
00:19:20,381 --> 00:19:21,580
Okay.

457
00:19:27,855 --> 00:19:30,188
Your home, Watson...

458
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,823
it's utterly pleasant.

459
00:19:31,825 --> 00:19:33,692
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

460
00:19:33,694 --> 00:19:35,394
When you told me
you wanted a life of your own,

461
00:19:35,396 --> 00:19:36,595
I didn't realize
that you meant you wanted

462
00:19:36,597 --> 00:19:38,030
the same life everyone else has.

463
00:19:38,032 --> 00:19:39,464
But at any rate,
none of my business, is it?

464
00:19:39,466 --> 00:19:41,233
It's not.
And I didn't ask you here

465
00:19:41,235 --> 00:19:42,634
to talk about my apartment.

466
00:19:42,636 --> 00:19:44,970
No, you asked me here
to discuss Kitty.

467
00:19:44,972 --> 00:19:46,471
If she were not
the topic of conversation,

468
00:19:46,473 --> 00:19:48,941
then you wouldn't have
invited me to your home,

469
00:19:48,943 --> 00:19:50,776
where there's no chance
she'll be present.

470
00:19:52,346 --> 00:19:53,946
She disappointed you
in some way.

471
00:19:53,948 --> 00:19:55,247
Skills not up to snuff?

472
00:19:55,249 --> 00:19:57,316
Please remember
she is a novice.

473
00:19:57,318 --> 00:19:58,850
Actually, she did a great job.

474
00:19:58,852 --> 00:20:00,285
But I have some concerns.

475
00:20:00,287 --> 00:20:01,954
I thought we could
talk about them.

476
00:20:03,757 --> 00:20:04,923
You think that
Kitty needs help

477
00:20:04,925 --> 00:20:06,091
above and beyond
my mentorship.

478
00:20:06,093 --> 00:20:07,392
You read the same
file I did.

479
00:20:07,394 --> 00:20:08,894
She's a rape victim.

480
00:20:08,896 --> 00:20:11,296
She was kept and tortured.

481
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,899
Mm.

482
00:20:16,136 --> 00:20:19,171
You know me, so surely you know

483
00:20:19,173 --> 00:20:22,874
I've broached the subject of
a support group meeting before.

484
00:20:22,876 --> 00:20:25,010
Even offered
to pay for therapy.

485
00:20:25,012 --> 00:20:26,812
She's not interested, I know.

486
00:20:26,814 --> 00:20:28,447
Just as you also know

487
00:20:28,449 --> 00:20:30,749
someone with a problem
can't be forced to get help.

488
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:32,551
They have to want it.

489
00:20:32,553 --> 00:20:34,786
What Kitty wants
is to be a detective.

490
00:20:36,523 --> 00:20:38,490
I am taking pains
to try and channel

491
00:20:38,492 --> 00:20:40,592
her residual feelings
into her work.

492
00:20:42,329 --> 00:20:44,463
Well, that works out
great for you.

493
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:48,400
You told me that
you took on a partner

494
00:20:48,402 --> 00:20:50,635
because you wanted to replicate
what you and I had.

495
00:20:50,637 --> 00:20:52,637
That you thought it helped
with your recovery.

496
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:54,539
You think I would
try and take advantage

497
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,208
of the victim of a trauma?

498
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,910
Of course not, but there is
a conflict of interest here.

499
00:20:58,912 --> 00:21:02,447
She needs what she needs,
but you need what you need, too.

500
00:21:06,053 --> 00:21:10,055
It's-it's good that you're
in her life now, Watson.

501
00:21:10,057 --> 00:21:12,524
I mean,
it's commonly believed that, um,

502
00:21:12,526 --> 00:21:16,228
a child benefits mostly from
the presence of two parents.

503
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,164
He-- or she, in this case--
can absorb certain qualities

504
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,466
from the father--
clear-eyed view of the world,

505
00:21:21,468 --> 00:21:23,168
capacity of
rational thought, etcetera.

506
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,170
They can also absorb certain
qualities from the mother.

507
00:21:25,172 --> 00:21:27,105
Excuse me, but I am not
Kitty's mother,

508
00:21:27,107 --> 00:21:28,807
and she sure as hell
is not our child.

509
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:30,942
You brought her here;
she looks up to you.

510
00:21:30,944 --> 00:21:32,944
She says that she doesn't
need help-- fine--

511
00:21:32,946 --> 00:21:34,579
but you know better.

512
00:21:34,581 --> 00:21:37,082
And you're gonna have to be
the one that tells her.

513
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,620
It's Harlan.

514
00:21:41,622 --> 00:21:44,523
Making progress with the maths.

515
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,660
We thought
that Byron and Ike

516
00:21:48,662 --> 00:21:50,462
arrived at Portal Ten
simultaneously.

517
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,664
That would've meant that they
were doing all the same math

518
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,032
at essentially
the same time.

519
00:21:54,034 --> 00:21:56,001
Only, the math
you found at Byron's place

520
00:21:56,003 --> 00:21:57,003
says that's wrong.

521
00:21:57,004 --> 00:21:58,470
He was one step behind Ike.

522
00:21:58,472 --> 00:22:00,705
Are you proposing he did
not kill Mr. Walaczek?

523
00:22:00,707 --> 00:22:03,175
I don't know, but that's
not the weirdest part.

524
00:22:03,177 --> 00:22:04,810
Byron was obsessive.

525
00:22:04,812 --> 00:22:06,211
He time-stamped
almost everything he did.

526
00:22:06,213 --> 00:22:09,047
He only solved
the Portal Nine problem,

527
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:11,316
the same problem that sent me
to that old factory last night.

528
00:22:11,318 --> 00:22:12,884
But get this--

529
00:22:12,886 --> 00:22:14,686
he wasn't given
the same problem as me.

530
00:22:14,688 --> 00:22:16,655
And so it would've yielded
GPS coordinates

531
00:22:16,657 --> 00:22:18,323
for an entirely
different location.

532
00:22:18,325 --> 00:22:21,760
The person in charge of
the game changed the clue

533
00:22:21,762 --> 00:22:23,328
after the police
found Ike's body.

534
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:25,964
Well, he had to, right?

535
00:22:25,966 --> 00:22:27,899
If he hadn't, he would be
sending other competitors

536
00:22:27,901 --> 00:22:29,101
to an active crime scene.

537
00:22:29,103 --> 00:22:30,402
The important thing is

538
00:22:30,404 --> 00:22:31,536
I figured out the coordinates

539
00:22:31,538 --> 00:22:32,771
to the second location.

540
00:22:32,773 --> 00:22:35,540
I know where Byron went.

541
00:22:35,542 --> 00:22:36,842
What are you doing?

542
00:22:36,844 --> 00:22:38,410
You're saying he
time-stamped everything.

543
00:22:38,412 --> 00:22:40,345
I'm looking at the time
he received his clues.

544
00:22:40,347 --> 00:22:42,647
It's all there, to the second,
but what does that have to do...

545
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:44,149
What if you hadn't
found a body?

546
00:22:44,151 --> 00:22:46,118
If the game had
proceeded as planned,

547
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,486
what were you meant
to do there?

548
00:22:47,488 --> 00:22:49,354
I would have sent a text
to the phone number,

549
00:22:49,356 --> 00:22:51,523
the one that the killer painted
over, and then I would have

550
00:22:51,525 --> 00:22:52,891
gotten a message back
with the next problem.

551
00:22:52,893 --> 00:22:54,559
There's an extra
step in there.

552
00:22:54,561 --> 00:22:56,428
Why all this rigmarole with
phone numbers and texts?

553
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,064
Why not just post the problem
itself at the factory?

554
00:22:59,066 --> 00:23:02,100
I don't know, it's just the way
the game is played.

555
00:23:02,102 --> 00:23:04,102
They're for an old
industrial area in Queens.

556
00:23:04,104 --> 00:23:06,805
You're welcome
for finding your suspect.

557
00:23:06,807 --> 00:23:09,207
If I'm right, Harlan,
what you've found...

558
00:23:09,209 --> 00:23:11,109
is the site of
another murder.

559
00:23:11,111 --> 00:23:13,245
Byron Lowenthal's.

560
00:23:15,983 --> 00:23:18,216
You were right,
Lowenthal's dead.

561
00:23:18,218 --> 00:23:20,952
He was shot in the foot,
then the knee.

562
00:23:20,954 --> 00:23:22,821
Just like
Ike Wallaczek.

563
00:23:22,823 --> 00:23:26,391
I'm, uh, gonna look
over here now.

564
00:23:26,393 --> 00:23:29,427
Well, we think the perp
was pulling the body

565
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:31,429
to a car that was parked
over there.

566
00:23:31,431 --> 00:23:34,065
Then he just
left him here.

567
00:23:34,067 --> 00:23:35,901
Probably afraid
he'd been spotted.

568
00:23:35,903 --> 00:23:38,803
There's a lot
of homeless in the area.

569
00:23:41,441 --> 00:23:43,008
Question is:

570
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:45,010
how'd you know
Lowenthal was the next victim

571
00:23:45,012 --> 00:23:46,511
and not the killer?

572
00:23:49,316 --> 00:23:51,750
Well, that's
quite simple, really.

573
00:23:51,752 --> 00:23:54,352
The game is directing
its players to remote locales,

574
00:23:54,354 --> 00:23:56,788
and then instructing them
to send a text message

575
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,256
indicating their presence.

576
00:23:58,258 --> 00:24:00,125
I suspect the killer wanted
to remove the body

577
00:24:00,127 --> 00:24:02,928
so he could keep this new
location “in play,” so to speak.

578
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:05,130
Still missing the “simple” part.

579
00:24:05,132 --> 00:24:06,698
The late Mr. Lowenthal

580
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,366
received his final clue

581
00:24:08,368 --> 00:24:10,235
after Harlan discovered
Ike Wallaczek's body,

582
00:24:10,237 --> 00:24:12,737
but before news of the killing
had reached the media.

583
00:24:12,739 --> 00:24:14,439
That means the
game's designer

584
00:24:14,441 --> 00:24:16,408
knew the location
had been compromised.

585
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,577
And the only way
that he could have known that,

586
00:24:18,579 --> 00:24:20,111
at the time that he knew it,

587
00:24:20,113 --> 00:24:21,880
was if he, himself,
was the killer.

588
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,917
Belphegor's Prime is not
a treasure hunt.

589
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,619
It's a trap.

590
00:24:40,696 --> 00:24:42,196
Better?

591
00:24:42,198 --> 00:24:44,665
False alarm.

592
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:47,668
But I still feel
a little queasy.

593
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,273
This new dead guy--

594
00:24:52,275 --> 00:24:54,875
your friend said that he was
tortured, too, right?

595
00:24:54,877 --> 00:24:57,244
Right before the killer tried
to abscond with his corpse.

596
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:59,213
I assume
he intended to take

597
00:24:59,215 --> 00:25:02,383
Ike Wallaczek away with him
as well, only Ike was too large.

598
00:25:02,385 --> 00:25:04,685
A speedy mothballing
was the best he could do.

599
00:25:04,687 --> 00:25:07,221
So, just to recap,

600
00:25:07,223 --> 00:25:09,657
I've spent the last
few months of my life

601
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:13,360
playing a game that was
designed to kill me.

602
00:25:13,362 --> 00:25:15,629
Got to be a metaphor
in there somewhere, right?

603
00:25:15,631 --> 00:25:18,966
I think the word you're
looking for is “moral.”

604
00:25:18,968 --> 00:25:21,902
There is a moral in there:
games are for idiots.

605
00:25:24,707 --> 00:25:26,473
Breaking news from Ramapo.

606
00:25:26,475 --> 00:25:29,443
Kitty reports the Center for
Applied Mathematics and Logic

607
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,912
is not the sponsor
of Belphegor's Prime.

608
00:25:31,914 --> 00:25:34,148
Then it's got to be
a serial killer, right?

609
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,716
Someone who's obsessed
with mathematicians?

610
00:25:35,718 --> 00:25:37,284
Mm.

611
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,920
Perhaps he was bullied
by mathematicians as a child.

612
00:25:39,922 --> 00:25:42,056
Or mathematicians
killed his parents.

613
00:25:42,058 --> 00:25:43,657
I'm being serious.

614
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:45,726
Serial killers who devise
elaborate death traps

615
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,461
are the stuff of pulp fiction.

616
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:49,229
And besides, with respect
to these murders,

617
00:25:49,231 --> 00:25:51,165
there are none
of the elaborations

618
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:53,767
which mark that sort of culprit.

619
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:55,970
If anything, I would describe
the work as businesslike.

620
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:58,172
Then it's the government.

621
00:25:58,174 --> 00:26:01,241
I mean, the-the game was some
sort of test to weed out people

622
00:26:01,243 --> 00:26:03,243
who could weaponize math.

623
00:26:03,245 --> 00:26:05,179
The American intelligence
apparatus may be clod-like,

624
00:26:05,181 --> 00:26:07,014
but I think they would
do a better job

625
00:26:07,016 --> 00:26:08,749
of disposing of two bodies,
don't you?

626
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:11,785
Watson?

627
00:26:11,787 --> 00:26:13,621
I just heard
from one of the suspects

628
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:14,922
Marcus and I talked to
yesterday,

629
00:26:14,924 --> 00:26:16,290
another puzzle-hunter.

630
00:26:16,292 --> 00:26:18,525
Tell me he confessed
to the murders.

631
00:26:18,527 --> 00:26:20,427
We ruled him out right away,
but he heard about

632
00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:22,329
Byron Lowenthal's murder on
the news and wanted me to know

633
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:25,165
he's at a friend's place,
some guy named Paul.

634
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,934
That is fascinating.

635
00:26:26,936 --> 00:26:28,369
Actually, it might be.

636
00:26:28,371 --> 00:26:31,038
Paul is positive he knows
who the killer is.

637
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,807
I know the guards
are a bit much,

638
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:35,509
but I wanted everyone
to feel safe.

639
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:38,178
And, besides,
math has been good to me.

640
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,279
Commodities.

641
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:40,848
So, you and your friends,

642
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:43,150
you were competitors
in Belphegor's Prime?

643
00:26:43,152 --> 00:26:45,352
Most of us. Some of the others
are just here for the math.

644
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,121
You said you could
identify the killer.

645
00:26:47,123 --> 00:26:49,323
I can, sort of.

646
00:26:52,061 --> 00:26:54,194
“Mo Shellshocker.”

647
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:56,930
It's a pseudonym,
obviously, but I'm telling you,

648
00:26:56,932 --> 00:26:58,365
this is the guy
you're looking for.

649
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,600
I've heard of him.

650
00:26:59,602 --> 00:27:01,335
He uses his blog
to expose bad math.

651
00:27:01,337 --> 00:27:03,837
Corrupt economists, biased
pollsters, that sort of thing.

652
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:05,572
He's actually
sort of a crusader.

653
00:27:05,574 --> 00:27:06,574
He's a murderer.

654
00:27:06,575 --> 00:27:09,143
How can you be
so sure?

655
00:27:09,145 --> 00:27:10,744
When he isn't crusading,
he's competing in puzzle hunts.

656
00:27:10,746 --> 00:27:11,812
A few months ago,

657
00:27:11,814 --> 00:27:13,080
he claimed to
have solved

658
00:27:13,082 --> 00:27:14,815
Cicada 3301 two
years in a row.

659
00:27:14,817 --> 00:27:17,484
Some people called BS,
including...

660
00:27:17,486 --> 00:27:20,120
Ike Wallaczek
and Byron Lowenthal.

661
00:27:20,122 --> 00:27:21,221
“WallaCheckYourMath,”

662
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:22,489
“ByLow2020.”

663
00:27:22,491 --> 00:27:23,757
Those are their
online handles.

664
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:25,392
Their friends
will confirm it.

665
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,528
A flame war does not
a murderer make.

666
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:30,097
The stuff these guys were
slinging at each other was ugly.

667
00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:32,099
Mo knew they were into hunts,
and so he built one

668
00:27:32,101 --> 00:27:34,034
that would send them to places
where he could kill them.

669
00:27:34,036 --> 00:27:35,469
That's what we're
doing here is

670
00:27:35,471 --> 00:27:36,837
we're just sifting
through all the math

671
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:38,338
he's posted on his blog
over the years,

672
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,840
to see if we could
find his signature

673
00:27:39,842 --> 00:27:41,975
or something that
could identify him.

674
00:27:41,977 --> 00:27:45,279
If two people weren't dead,
we'd probably be having fun.

675
00:27:45,281 --> 00:27:46,747
But still, the
chances that he left

676
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:48,582
something like that
in his math...

677
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,784
If it's there, we'll find it.
In the meantime,

678
00:27:50,786 --> 00:27:52,186
we thought the
police should know

679
00:27:52,188 --> 00:27:53,687
who they're really
dealing with.

680
00:27:53,689 --> 00:27:55,389
<i>I've got to go meet someone</i>

681
00:27:55,391 --> 00:27:56,924
about my other case.

682
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:59,927
You're good to pass all this
along to Marcus? Okay.

683
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:03,030
I must say, I'm surprised you
didn't offer to stay and help.

684
00:28:03,032 --> 00:28:05,265
Mr. Ettinger makes
a compelling case with respect

685
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,067
to Mo Shellshocker's
viability as a suspect.

686
00:28:07,069 --> 00:28:09,002
Mo is a genius.

687
00:28:09,004 --> 00:28:10,637
We're talking off the charts.

688
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:12,139
Leibniz meets Euler meets Gauss.

689
00:28:12,141 --> 00:28:14,108
Huh.
He may have an ego,

690
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,110
but he's not gonna kill
anyone over a few comments.

691
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:18,312
So, while “The League of
Concerned Mathematician”"

692
00:28:18,314 --> 00:28:21,014
chases its tail up there, I
am gonna do the smart thing

693
00:28:21,016 --> 00:28:22,416
and get out of town.

694
00:28:22,418 --> 00:28:24,485
You can let me know
when it all blows over.

695
00:28:24,487 --> 00:28:26,386
You're not going
anywhere, Harlan.

696
00:28:26,388 --> 00:28:29,223
Or should I call you
Mo Shellshocker?

697
00:28:32,728 --> 00:28:34,661
Did you honestly think
I wouldn't recognize

698
00:28:34,663 --> 00:28:36,130
an anagram of my own name?

699
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:40,567
I knew I should've gone
with “Choker Hell Moss”"

700
00:28:40,569 --> 00:28:42,569
But I never thought
that you would see it, okay?

701
00:28:42,571 --> 00:28:44,104
Math is my thing, not yours.

702
00:28:44,106 --> 00:28:46,473
It's my name, Harlan;
that makes it my thing.

703
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,675
It was an homage.

704
00:28:48,677 --> 00:28:50,043
Explain.

705
00:28:50,045 --> 00:28:52,045
Every day, all over the world,

706
00:28:52,047 --> 00:28:54,348
math is used to trick people.

707
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,917
Data dredging to sell
pharmaceuticals.

708
00:28:56,919 --> 00:28:59,720
Publication bias
to justify wars.

709
00:28:59,722 --> 00:29:02,322
In the wrong hands, math can be
manipulated, abused.

710
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:05,425
And I decided to do
something about it.

711
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:09,596
You catch people
who murder other people.

712
00:29:09,598 --> 00:29:11,431
I catch people who murder math.

713
00:29:11,433 --> 00:29:14,568
According to this,
Mo is a wanted man.

714
00:29:17,606 --> 00:29:19,940
Harlan?

715
00:29:19,942 --> 00:29:23,110
The D.O.D. was working
on a new fighter.

716
00:29:23,112 --> 00:29:27,047
Only, I knew that the
performance stats were bogus.

717
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:29,116
A friend of mine found
the internal numbers,

718
00:29:29,118 --> 00:29:31,251
and I sort of published them.

719
00:29:31,253 --> 00:29:33,320
So you put classified
Department of Defense documents

720
00:29:33,322 --> 00:29:34,888
on the Internet.

721
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:36,623
Isn't that what
you would have done?

722
00:29:38,928 --> 00:29:41,562
Fine! I screwed up, okay?

723
00:29:41,564 --> 00:29:43,730
But, hey, that's what I do,
right? I screw up.

724
00:29:43,732 --> 00:29:46,233
If I didn't, then probably you
wouldn't have secretly fired me.

725
00:29:46,235 --> 00:29:47,968
Excuse me?

726
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,403
I know about Indira Patel!

727
00:29:51,006 --> 00:29:53,340
I know you replaced me.

728
00:29:55,144 --> 00:29:58,979
Kitty, I think
we could use some tea.

729
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:04,318
Just tell me.

730
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,253
Tell me what math I got wrong.

731
00:30:06,255 --> 00:30:09,356
Tell me why you didn't let me
make it up to you.

732
00:30:09,358 --> 00:30:12,926
It wasn't the maths, it was you.

733
00:30:14,763 --> 00:30:18,232
Your work was impeccable.

734
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:20,334
And for the most part,
I enjoyed our collaborations.

735
00:30:20,336 --> 00:30:24,838
B-But over time, you just...
you became quite... needy.

736
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,406
What are you talking about?

737
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:29,109
Y-You asked my advice
on-on social matters,

738
00:30:29,111 --> 00:30:32,512
and you even invited me
to a party.

739
00:30:32,514 --> 00:30:34,648
You were my friend.

740
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,416
I was your employer, Harlan.

741
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:37,918
A-And you were my consultant.

742
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,419
One of many.

743
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:43,757
I know that I'm a little
obsessed with what I do.

744
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:46,960
That has always made it hard
to make friends.

745
00:30:46,962 --> 00:30:50,664
And I used to feel pretty bad
about that, and then I met you.

746
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:52,566
And I thought to myself,

747
00:30:52,568 --> 00:30:55,903
hey, if it doesn't bother him,
why should I let it bother me?

748
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:03,810
I got a lot
out of the work that we did.

749
00:31:03,812 --> 00:31:06,146
A lot.

750
00:31:06,148 --> 00:31:11,218
But if someone like you thinks
that I'm a loser, then...

751
00:31:22,564 --> 00:31:24,965
Hey, are we still doing this?

752
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:26,366
Doing what?

753
00:31:26,368 --> 00:31:28,502
Talking about the case.

754
00:31:28,504 --> 00:31:30,070
You're just sitting there.

755
00:31:30,072 --> 00:31:32,105
I'm thinking.

756
00:31:32,107 --> 00:31:34,308
I suspect the silence
is exacerbated

757
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,143
by the nature
of our communication.

758
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:37,811
Yes. Well, I don't
live there anymore.

759
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,713
So, if you want
to talk shop at night,

760
00:31:39,715 --> 00:31:41,515
this is the best I can do.

761
00:31:41,517 --> 00:31:45,252
Keep asking myself:
what did the killer want?

762
00:31:45,254 --> 00:31:48,255
He went to great lengths to lure
brilliant mathematicians

763
00:31:48,257 --> 00:31:49,489
to their deaths.

764
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,525
Winnowed out
the less gifted

765
00:31:51,527 --> 00:31:54,061
by making his problems
more and more complicated.

766
00:31:54,063 --> 00:31:57,597
He had a type, but I still think
he's a serial killer

767
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:59,266
only in the most
technical sense.

768
00:31:59,268 --> 00:32:01,201
He tortured both his victims.

769
00:32:01,203 --> 00:32:02,936
But there's no sign
that he enjoyed it.

770
00:32:02,938 --> 00:32:04,538
The work was
utilitarian,

771
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,740
suggesting it was
less for pleasure

772
00:32:06,742 --> 00:32:10,043
and more for persuasion.

773
00:32:10,045 --> 00:32:11,945
He wanted something.

774
00:32:11,947 --> 00:32:13,714
But what?

775
00:32:13,716 --> 00:32:16,483
Maybe there's a connection
between Wallaczek and Lowenthal

776
00:32:16,485 --> 00:32:18,418
we haven't spotted yet.

777
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,220
Maybe they were working
on a project together,

778
00:32:20,222 --> 00:32:21,822
something that was worth
a lot of money.

779
00:32:21,824 --> 00:32:23,857
There's no way the killer
could have predicted

780
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:26,093
which competitors would make it
to the terminal stage.

781
00:32:26,095 --> 00:32:28,795
That part of the game
was beyond his control.

782
00:32:28,797 --> 00:32:30,664
If it weren't,
he would've been prepared

783
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:33,300
to dispose of a body
the size of Ike Wallaczek's.

784
00:32:33,302 --> 00:32:35,335
So, even if there were a
connection between the victims,

785
00:32:35,337 --> 00:32:37,070
the killer could not
have counted on them

786
00:32:37,072 --> 00:32:38,839
being lured into his trap.

787
00:32:38,841 --> 00:32:41,041
Certainly not
in sequence.

788
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:45,112
His game was, in many respects,
one of chance.

789
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:51,718
Suggesting he knows what
he wants, but not who has it.

790
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,888
Like he was on a puzzle hunt
of his own.

791
00:32:56,825 --> 00:32:58,859
I'm back.

792
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:05,665
I'll set up
downstairs, yeah?

793
00:33:09,138 --> 00:33:11,238
I've been thinking about
what you said earlier.

794
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,740
I've decided to engage her
one more time

795
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:15,609
with regards
to her recuperation.

796
00:33:17,112 --> 00:33:21,815
I doubt she'll listen,
but I'll keep you apprised.

797
00:33:25,954 --> 00:33:27,421
I've been thinking.

798
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:29,623
About?
You. Your history.

799
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:31,825
Your decision
not to seek help.

800
00:33:31,827 --> 00:33:34,594
I think it's
a mistake.

801
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,530
Oh?

802
00:33:36,532 --> 00:33:38,198
I've looked into a number
of support groups.

803
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,633
As you are well aware,

804
00:33:39,635 --> 00:33:41,701
I have benefited greatly
from similar settings.

805
00:33:41,703 --> 00:33:43,270
You have.

806
00:33:43,272 --> 00:33:44,638
The process, I find,

807
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,906
is not unlike
voiding one's bowels...

808
00:33:45,908 --> 00:33:47,808
I'll go.
What?

809
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:49,676
I'll go.
Just get me the details.

810
00:33:52,014 --> 00:33:55,182
I've been thinking, too-- about
your number-cruncher, Harlan.

811
00:33:55,184 --> 00:33:57,017
You think I was
too hard on him.

812
00:33:57,019 --> 00:33:58,685
You will have consultants
of your own one day.

813
00:33:58,687 --> 00:34:01,488
You'll see that they require
management and focus.

814
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:04,124
They are but keys on a keyboard,
and we're the typists.

815
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:06,159
You could've given him
a shoeing for all I care.

816
00:34:06,161 --> 00:34:07,828
No, I'm just saying that

817
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:10,030
some of the stuff he's got
up to, it's quite good.

818
00:34:10,032 --> 00:34:11,698
You should take a look.

819
00:34:13,368 --> 00:34:15,735
You may find a fellow typist.

820
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,076
Hello?

821
00:34:23,078 --> 00:34:25,312
Yeah, I
hear that you and some friends

822
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:27,848
are trying to identify
Mo Shellshocker.

823
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,649
That's right. Who is this?

824
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:32,719
His name is Harlan Emple.

825
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:34,020
You got a pen?

826
00:34:34,022 --> 00:34:36,456
I'll-I'll give you his address.

827
00:34:52,454 --> 00:34:54,020
Harlan.

828
00:34:54,022 --> 00:34:56,356
You can't take a hint, can you?

829
00:34:56,358 --> 00:34:57,657
I got your text messages.

830
00:34:57,659 --> 00:34:58,958
I don't want to see you
right now.

831
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,827
So if you came here
to apologize...

832
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:03,363
Actually, I came here
to spare you an agonizing death.

833
00:35:04,299 --> 00:35:05,832
Can I come in?

834
00:35:05,834 --> 00:35:08,301
I was puzzling earlier

835
00:35:08,303 --> 00:35:12,038
as to why the killer went
to such specific lengths.

836
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,606
What did he want?

837
00:35:13,608 --> 00:35:15,809
And then Watson,
quite by accident,

838
00:35:15,811 --> 00:35:17,410
she made a most
compelling analogy.

839
00:35:17,412 --> 00:35:20,080
She said it was as if he
was on a hunt of his own.

840
00:35:20,082 --> 00:35:22,615
Duh. He was hunting
mathematicians.

841
00:35:22,617 --> 00:35:23,783
No, he wasn't.

842
00:35:23,785 --> 00:35:25,151
He was hunting<i> a</i> mathematician.

843
00:35:25,153 --> 00:35:26,619
One.

844
00:35:26,621 --> 00:35:29,389
A man who had concealed
his identity not only

845
00:35:29,391 --> 00:35:31,191
from the mathematics
community at large,

846
00:35:31,193 --> 00:35:32,859
but also from the FBI.

847
00:35:32,861 --> 00:35:35,395
A “crusader,”
you might call him.

848
00:35:35,397 --> 00:35:36,763
Wait a minute.

849
00:35:36,765 --> 00:35:38,731
Are you saying that
this was all about me?

850
00:35:53,448 --> 00:35:56,449
<i> Unfortunately, emulating</i>
<i>the work of people like me</i>

851
00:35:56,451 --> 00:35:59,018
<i>is not without risks.</i>

852
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,320
Creates enemies.

853
00:36:00,322 --> 00:36:02,889
I knew it was the government.

854
00:36:02,891 --> 00:36:04,424
It was a lottery winner.

855
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,260
Little over a year ago,

856
00:36:07,262 --> 00:36:09,529
you started a series of blogs
where you exposed the flaws

857
00:36:09,531 --> 00:36:11,664
in certain scratch card
lottery games.

858
00:36:11,666 --> 00:36:13,766
Tickets like this one.

859
00:36:13,768 --> 00:36:15,802
I wrote about
baited hook games.

860
00:36:15,804 --> 00:36:17,971
Games where the numbers
are printed on the front.

861
00:36:17,973 --> 00:36:20,707
Scratch off the hidden numbers,
hope for a match.

862
00:36:20,709 --> 00:36:23,309
Only, you proved that with
careful mathematical analysis

863
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:25,512
of the visible numbers,
you could predict

864
00:36:25,514 --> 00:36:28,381
which tickets were winners
80% of the time.

865
00:36:28,383 --> 00:36:29,682
If you had exploited

866
00:36:29,684 --> 00:36:32,085
this flaw,
rather than exposing it,

867
00:36:32,087 --> 00:36:33,520
you could have made millions.

868
00:36:33,522 --> 00:36:36,022
Well... sure.
But that would been cheating.

869
00:36:36,024 --> 00:36:37,157
Right.

870
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:38,825
So imagine
for a moment

871
00:36:38,827 --> 00:36:41,060
that you are a less
honest mathematician.

872
00:36:41,062 --> 00:36:42,495
Right?

873
00:36:42,497 --> 00:36:44,063
You've been taking
advantage of these games

874
00:36:44,065 --> 00:36:47,967
for a couple of years to
amass a small fortune.

875
00:36:47,969 --> 00:36:49,502
And then “Mo"
comes along.

876
00:36:49,504 --> 00:36:51,971
He starts exposing
the broken games.

877
00:36:51,973 --> 00:36:54,340
State lottery commissions
shut them down.

878
00:36:54,342 --> 00:36:56,976
The exploitable
games dry up.

879
00:36:56,978 --> 00:37:00,613
Now, if you were a
psychopathic lottery cheat,

880
00:37:00,615 --> 00:37:02,582
how do you fix that?

881
00:37:02,584 --> 00:37:04,484
You kill Mo.

882
00:37:04,486 --> 00:37:07,253
<i>Unfortunately, Mo is elusive.</i>

883
00:37:07,255 --> 00:37:08,821
<i>Anonymous.</i>

884
00:37:08,823 --> 00:37:11,224
The only thing
he knew about him for sure

885
00:37:11,226 --> 00:37:14,394
was that he could not resist
a puzzle hunt.

886
00:37:14,396 --> 00:37:17,130
Now, if you were smart enough
to identify

887
00:37:17,132 --> 00:37:19,399
and take advantage of
broken lottery games...

888
00:37:19,401 --> 00:37:21,868
Then I'm smart enough
to design a puzzle hunt.

889
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:25,338
This plan was not
without its flaws.

890
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:28,775
Once a competitor
reached the terminal stage,

891
00:37:28,777 --> 00:37:32,745
the killer could not be certain
that he'd trapped Mo, could he?

892
00:37:32,747 --> 00:37:34,480
So he tortured them.

893
00:37:34,482 --> 00:37:37,083
I submit he forced them to
log on to Mo's Web site,

894
00:37:37,085 --> 00:37:39,686
and when they failed...

895
00:37:41,323 --> 00:37:42,755
After two murders,

896
00:37:42,757 --> 00:37:44,290
the game was compromised.

897
00:37:44,292 --> 00:37:46,192
So the killer devises
a Plan “B.”

898
00:37:46,194 --> 00:37:47,460
He tricks

899
00:37:47,462 --> 00:37:49,229
a group of his peers

900
00:37:49,231 --> 00:37:51,097
into helping search
for an alternative means

901
00:37:51,099 --> 00:37:53,032
of identifying Mo.

902
00:37:56,504 --> 00:37:58,438
You're talking about that guy.

903
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,906
The one with the penthouse.

904
00:37:59,908 --> 00:38:02,742
<i>Paul?</i>

905
00:38:02,744 --> 00:38:05,044
Lottery winners
are public record.

906
00:38:05,046 --> 00:38:07,814
So when I searched for
the names of repeat winners

907
00:38:07,816 --> 00:38:09,482
in the dates prior
to your posts...

908
00:38:09,484 --> 00:38:11,317
I can't believe
I drank his water.

909
00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:12,685
I called him.

910
00:38:12,687 --> 00:38:14,654
I identified you as Mo.

911
00:38:14,656 --> 00:38:16,122
And I gave him your address.

912
00:38:16,124 --> 00:38:17,590
You what?!

913
00:38:21,129 --> 00:38:23,062
Drop your weapon!

914
00:38:23,064 --> 00:38:24,597
<i>I did not, however, give him</i>

915
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:25,965
<i>the correct apartment number.</i>

916
00:38:25,967 --> 00:38:28,334
He was arrested
a little over an hour ago.

917
00:38:30,739 --> 00:38:31,871
Tried to call you to
tell you, but, um...

918
00:38:31,873 --> 00:38:33,539
But I was ignoring you.

919
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:35,008
Yes, you were ignoring me.

920
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,209
Look, you know

921
00:38:36,211 --> 00:38:37,377
that I'm still screwed, right?

922
00:38:37,379 --> 00:38:39,279
You told him that I'm Mo.

923
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:42,115
He's gonna tell the police,
they're gonna tell the FBI...

924
00:38:42,117 --> 00:38:43,516
The NYPD is under
the impression

925
00:38:43,518 --> 00:38:45,385
that I lied about
your connection to Mo

926
00:38:45,387 --> 00:38:47,920
in order to draw
Mr. Ettinger out.

927
00:38:47,922 --> 00:38:49,555
As far as the
FBI goes, well,

928
00:38:49,557 --> 00:38:51,958
I've got some associates
who have created a trail

929
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,860
which will
strongly suggest that Mo

930
00:38:53,862 --> 00:38:55,728
is a cyber-terrorist
I became aware of

931
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:58,197
whilst working for, um...

932
00:38:58,199 --> 00:38:59,766
queen and country.

933
00:38:59,768 --> 00:39:02,135
Your secret's
quite safe.

934
00:39:02,137 --> 00:39:03,903
Thanks.

935
00:39:06,508 --> 00:39:09,776
My reasons for preserving you
are entirely selfish, Harlan.

936
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:13,279
You are a tremendous asset.

937
00:39:13,281 --> 00:39:15,815
I have little doubt

938
00:39:15,817 --> 00:39:19,118
I will need your help again
in the future.

939
00:39:26,461 --> 00:39:28,528
Me or him?

940
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:29,996
You.

941
00:39:29,998 --> 00:39:31,798
I have an update on
that real estate flipper.

942
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,433
I thought you might
want to know.

943
00:39:39,274 --> 00:39:41,908
I tracked down the truck rental
receipts to get her name.

944
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,142
Valerie Cork.

945
00:39:43,144 --> 00:39:44,911
She's an art authenticator.

946
00:39:44,913 --> 00:39:46,779
And that crate you saw?

947
00:39:46,781 --> 00:39:48,414
There was
something called

948
00:39:48,416 --> 00:39:50,683
a scanning fluorescence
spectrometry machine inside.

949
00:39:50,685 --> 00:39:52,251
They're used...
To find paintings

950
00:39:52,253 --> 00:39:53,553
underneath other paintings.

951
00:39:53,555 --> 00:39:55,288
So it turns out
that the building

952
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:56,689
Chad Keswick was looking to buy

953
00:39:56,691 --> 00:39:59,025
was leased by the WPA
during the Depression.

954
00:39:59,027 --> 00:40:00,927
They commissioned a
mural for the lobby.

955
00:40:00,929 --> 00:40:03,329
The artist was a
notorious communist,

956
00:40:03,331 --> 00:40:05,365
so when the property passed
into private hands in the '50s,

957
00:40:05,367 --> 00:40:06,999
the new owners
had it painted over.

958
00:40:07,001 --> 00:40:08,735
But it was still there,
under the paint.

959
00:40:08,737 --> 00:40:11,037
A lost work by Diego Rivera.

960
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:13,473
It's worth ten times
the price of the building.

961
00:40:14,676 --> 00:40:17,043
I was hoping to leak
the truth to the<i> Times.</i>

962
00:40:18,113 --> 00:40:20,046
I promised you a cut of my fee.

963
00:40:20,048 --> 00:40:22,148
But I'm pretty sure
the mural's gonna end up

964
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:24,384
in the hands of
a historical trust.

965
00:40:24,386 --> 00:40:26,352
I'd feel obligated
to refund my client,

966
00:40:26,354 --> 00:40:28,388
which means you'd get
a cut of nothing.

967
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:31,457
That works for me.

968
00:40:31,459 --> 00:40:33,493
Okay.

969
00:40:35,463 --> 00:40:37,397
I think you should know

970
00:40:37,399 --> 00:40:39,732
that I am going
to a meeting tonight.

971
00:40:41,803 --> 00:40:45,505
One of those
support groups for...

972
00:40:45,507 --> 00:40:47,340
people like me.

973
00:40:47,342 --> 00:40:49,876
It was, uh, Sherlock's idea.

974
00:40:49,878 --> 00:40:51,644
That's great.

975
00:40:51,646 --> 00:40:53,446
I know you put him up to it.

976
00:40:53,448 --> 00:40:55,381
We talked.

977
00:40:57,552 --> 00:41:00,219
When he first approached me
in London,

978
00:41:00,221 --> 00:41:03,556
I was...

979
00:41:03,558 --> 00:41:05,558
in a bad way.

980
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,227
And I had been for a while.

981
00:41:08,229 --> 00:41:11,130
But then,
when he talked about

982
00:41:11,132 --> 00:41:12,365
the work that he did,

983
00:41:12,367 --> 00:41:16,035
about the things
that he saw in me...

984
00:41:18,406 --> 00:41:19,739
I want it.

985
00:41:19,741 --> 00:41:21,874
I want every bit
of what's he offered me,

986
00:41:21,876 --> 00:41:23,843
of what he offered you, but...

987
00:41:23,845 --> 00:41:26,212
if I've learned one thing
over the last few weeks,

988
00:41:26,214 --> 00:41:28,047
it's that he can't pull it off.

989
00:41:28,049 --> 00:41:29,682
Not by himself, anyway.

990
00:41:31,586 --> 00:41:34,153
And if I'm gonna get
what I want,

991
00:41:34,155 --> 00:41:37,690
then I'm going to need
your help, too.

992
00:41:40,361 --> 00:41:42,829
I still think
the meetings are bollocks,

993
00:41:42,831 --> 00:41:44,931
but you say they're important.

994
00:41:44,933 --> 00:41:47,967
They matter to you, so...

995
00:41:47,969 --> 00:41:49,735
What do you say, Watson?

996
00:41:49,737 --> 00:41:52,071
Will you help me?

997
00:41:56,277 --> 00:41:58,244
I don't know how it happened.

998
00:41:58,246 --> 00:42:01,547
It just... hit me.

999
00:42:01,549 --> 00:42:03,983
Like a truck, out of nowhere.

1000
00:42:04,853 --> 00:42:07,753
Work is good.

1001
00:42:07,755 --> 00:42:09,755
I have friends.

1002
00:42:09,757 --> 00:42:13,092
I'm in a
relationship.

1003
00:42:13,094 --> 00:42:16,896
Somewhere along
the way, somehow,

1004
00:42:16,898 --> 00:42:19,732
I stopped being a victim

1005
00:42:19,734 --> 00:42:22,602
and became a survivor.

1006
00:42:22,604 --> 00:42:25,705
So, I guess all I'm saying is,
there's hope.

1007
00:42:26,357 --> 00:42:31,686
Do the work. Love yourself.
There's hope.

If you're looking for Sherlock,
he's downstairs.

3
00:00:04,785 --> 00:00:05,841
Okay.

4
00:00:05,842 --> 00:00:07,541
<i>His name is Harlan Emple.</i>

5
00:00:07,543 --> 00:00:09,176
<i>He is the Rachel P. Hanson</i>
<i>Professor</i>

6
00:00:09,178 --> 00:00:11,301
for Applied Mathematics
at Columbia University.

7
00:00:11,301 --> 00:00:14,502
What I don't get is
why he isn't wearing a shirt.

8
00:00:14,504 --> 00:00:17,372
He doesn't like anything to come
between him and the numbers.

9
00:00:17,374 --> 00:00:18,415
What is it?

10
00:00:18,438 --> 00:00:20,274
The answers to your questions
about Kitty.

11
00:00:20,276 --> 00:00:22,710
The truth is she was a
victim of a horrific crime.

12
00:00:22,712 --> 00:00:24,646
<i>After you left last night,</i>

13
00:00:24,648 --> 00:00:26,848
Sherlock gave me an envelope.

14
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,249
Sherlock keeps saying

15
00:00:28,251 --> 00:00:30,385
that I need to get
a better sense of you,

16
00:00:30,387 --> 00:00:33,021
and maybe that will give you
a better sense of me.

17
00:00:42,065 --> 00:00:43,065
It's open.

18
00:00:47,637 --> 00:00:49,003
It's nothing.

19
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:50,872
It's Sherlock and
one of his experts.

20
00:00:50,874 --> 00:00:52,006
Which one?

21
00:00:52,008 --> 00:00:53,241
Phillip something.

22
00:00:53,243 --> 00:00:54,575
Must be new.

23
00:00:54,577 --> 00:00:57,445
He's a knife-thrower.

24
00:00:57,447 --> 00:00:58,913
Why does Sherlock have
a knife-thrower?

25
00:00:58,915 --> 00:01:00,748
He got bored the other day,

26
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,185
started looking into this, uh,
circus accident from the '30s.

27
00:01:04,187 --> 00:01:07,922
The Great Galardo perforated one
of his assistants during an act,

28
00:01:07,924 --> 00:01:09,924
except Sherlock thinks
the blade was thrown

29
00:01:09,926 --> 00:01:11,492
by somebody in the stands,
not Galardo.

30
00:01:11,494 --> 00:01:15,096
Phillip, as far as I
can tell, disagrees.

31
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:18,900
It can't be done, okay?

32
00:01:18,902 --> 00:01:19,934
It was done.

33
00:01:19,936 --> 00:01:21,335
You're wrong.

34
00:01:21,337 --> 00:01:23,538
Nobody can chuck
a knife that far.

35
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,239
What's this?

36
00:01:25,241 --> 00:01:26,207
You're...

37
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:27,209
Not here.

38
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,509
I'm not here.

39
00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:29,711
Remember that, okay?

40
00:01:29,713 --> 00:01:31,279
Oh, yes. Heaven
forfend your work

41
00:01:31,281 --> 00:01:33,247
with me should endanger
your precious day job.

42
00:01:33,249 --> 00:01:35,116
You throw knives?

43
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,252
You know, it was supposed
to be just you here.

44
00:01:38,254 --> 00:01:41,355
Phillip is arguably the greatest
knife-thrower in the world.

45
00:01:41,357 --> 00:01:42,790
Has been for decades.

46
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:43,925
Only, there's little money

47
00:01:43,927 --> 00:01:45,193
to be made
in the impalement arts.

48
00:01:45,195 --> 00:01:46,494
So, as a youth, he turned

49
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,563
to what you Americans
term “football”"

50
00:01:48,565 --> 00:01:50,131
Is this a joke?

51
00:01:53,837 --> 00:01:55,002
Phillip, head
and heart.

52
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:56,904
Come on.
Head and heart.

53
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:06,814
Can I go?

54
00:02:06,816 --> 00:02:09,484
Yeah.

55
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,489
15 years he spent throwing
that misshapen ball around.

56
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:16,057
15 years.

57
00:02:16,059 --> 00:02:18,259
When I think of the acclaim
he could have brought

58
00:02:18,261 --> 00:02:20,828
to competitive blade slinging.

59
00:02:27,237 --> 00:02:29,036
You're following me,
Watson.

60
00:02:29,038 --> 00:02:30,338
I don't like it.

61
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,740
I want you to help
me with something.

62
00:02:32,742 --> 00:02:33,908
This is Chad Keswick.

63
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,976
He buys distressed
buildings,

64
00:02:34,978 --> 00:02:36,210
paints, spackles,

65
00:02:36,212 --> 00:02:37,645
and then flips them
for quick money.

66
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:39,180
Who'd he kill?
No one.

67
00:02:39,182 --> 00:02:41,315
I was hired by one of
his rivals to find out

68
00:02:41,317 --> 00:02:43,017
why he's been circling
this old office building

69
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:44,218
in Jamaica, Queens.

70
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,586
She wants to know
why he thinks

71
00:02:45,588 --> 00:02:47,355
the building is
a good investment.

72
00:02:47,357 --> 00:02:49,590
Is there a crime in there,
something worth investigating?

73
00:02:49,592 --> 00:02:50,925
Well, I've been
shadowing Keswick,

74
00:02:50,927 --> 00:02:52,593
but yesterday I think
he noticed me.

75
00:02:52,595 --> 00:02:54,595
I want to switch
up the tail.

76
00:02:54,597 --> 00:02:57,231
You followed me for over
a week before I noticed you.

77
00:02:57,233 --> 00:02:59,033
Help me out, and I'll
cut you in on my fee.

78
00:02:59,035 --> 00:03:02,003
I don't work for you,
I work for Sherlock.

79
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:03,437
I worked for him, too.

80
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,773
And, in my experience,
he was always supportive

81
00:03:05,775 --> 00:03:07,942
of taking on work
outside the partnership.

82
00:03:07,944 --> 00:03:10,912
Sorry, it's not my cup of tea.

83
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:33,034
Hello, Portal Ten.

84
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,247
I'm here, Belphegor.

00:03:46,249 --> 00:03:49,784

Belphegor's Prime.

Math-- maybe you've heard of it.

I've got some math for you.

96

One dead guy

97
00:05:00,337 --> 00:05:02,104
found in the same
deserted factory.

98
00:05:02,106 --> 00:05:06,108
I was not “found” there;
I am the one who called 911.

99
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,310
I was waiting there
for the police.

100
00:05:08,312 --> 00:05:09,745
Mr. Emple,

101
00:05:09,747 --> 00:05:11,613
we're just trying
to do our jobs, all right?

102
00:05:11,615 --> 00:05:13,048
First officers
on the scene described you

103
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,516
as “extremely agitated.”

104
00:05:14,518 --> 00:05:15,984
Well, of course
I was agitated.

105
00:05:15,986 --> 00:05:18,754
I had just found
a dead guy in mothballs!

106
00:05:18,756 --> 00:05:21,790
And did I mention that I have
not slept in almost two days?

107
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:23,358
Because of the math game.

108
00:05:24,762 --> 00:05:26,195
Can I borrow those?

109
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:31,100
This...

110
00:05:31,102 --> 00:05:33,302
is Belphegor's Prime, okay?

111
00:05:33,304 --> 00:05:35,304
It's a numeric palindrome.

112
00:05:35,306 --> 00:05:40,776
It's 666 bookended by 13 zeroes
and then bracketed with ones.

113
00:05:40,778 --> 00:05:43,846
Named for the demon Belphegor
who was a prince of hell.

114
00:05:43,848 --> 00:05:46,448
The first clue for the hunt
started making the rounds

115
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,883
a few months ago.

116
00:05:47,885 --> 00:05:49,651
It was a JPEG with two numbers
hidden in it.

117
00:05:49,653 --> 00:05:51,453
You divide those numbers
by Belphegor's Prime,

118
00:05:51,455 --> 00:05:54,890
and you get the GPS coordinates
for a restroom at the Bronx Zoo.

119
00:05:54,892 --> 00:05:56,959
You go to the restroom,
you find a phone number.

120
00:05:56,961 --> 00:05:58,927
You send a text to the number,
you get the next clue.

121
00:05:58,929 --> 00:05:59,962
Which is another math problem.

122
00:05:59,964 --> 00:06:00,929
Exactly.

123
00:06:00,931 --> 00:06:02,397
Only, this one is harder.

124
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,099
And that's how it works.

125
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:05,934
You know, but for
each one that you solve,

126
00:06:05,936 --> 00:06:08,103
you get a new set
of GPS coordinates.

127
00:06:08,105 --> 00:06:11,473
And that means that you've
completed a stage, or a portal.

128
00:06:11,475 --> 00:06:13,509
And last night,
I was on Portal Ten.

129
00:06:13,511 --> 00:06:15,711
And...

130
00:06:17,014 --> 00:06:18,313
You know what?

131
00:06:18,315 --> 00:06:20,015
I want to talk
to Sherlock and Joan.

132
00:06:20,017 --> 00:06:21,917
Look, Mr. Emple...
No, I'm sorry.

133
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,019
I told the police down
at the factory that I know them.

134
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:25,287
Isn't that the whole reason

135
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:26,922
that I was brought here
to this squad?

136
00:06:26,924 --> 00:06:30,392
I-I am not saying another word
until they are here.

137
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:35,264
Harlan Emple is
indeed an acquaintance.

138
00:06:35,266 --> 00:06:37,733
He is, in point of fact,
one of my “irregulars.”

139
00:06:37,735 --> 00:06:38,801
One of your what?

140
00:06:38,803 --> 00:06:40,302
Irregulars.

141
00:06:40,304 --> 00:06:41,770
I'm your consultant, Captain;
they are mine.

142
00:06:41,772 --> 00:06:43,572
They're a handful
of experts I turn to

143
00:06:43,574 --> 00:06:46,108
when I encounter problems which
are beyond my pool of knowledge.

144
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,810
Harlan is
a brilliant mathematician.

145
00:06:47,812 --> 00:06:49,778
And on the handful of occasions
I have tackled a case

146
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,046
which pertained
to mathematics...

147
00:06:51,048 --> 00:06:53,182
He helped you out.
Well, the good news

148
00:06:53,184 --> 00:06:56,018
for him is the preliminary
autopsy report just came in

149
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,252
before you got here.

150
00:06:57,254 --> 00:06:59,021
And the M.E. puts
the time of death

151
00:06:59,023 --> 00:07:00,989
between 4:00 and
6:00 p.m. last night.

152
00:07:00,991 --> 00:07:02,124
Mr. Emple was teaching

153
00:07:02,126 --> 00:07:03,358
a class at Columbia.

154
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,394
So the victim is
yet to be identified?

155
00:07:05,396 --> 00:07:07,663
No I.D., no phone.

156
00:07:07,665 --> 00:07:09,865
First detective on the scene
liked it for a mob hit,

157
00:07:09,867 --> 00:07:11,500
so while we're
running the prints,

158
00:07:11,502 --> 00:07:13,602
he's showing the vic's
face around OCID.

159
00:07:13,604 --> 00:07:16,839
Marcus here was about to walk
the scene with Mr. Emple.

160
00:07:16,841 --> 00:07:18,774
You're here now;
you might as well tag along.

161
00:07:18,776 --> 00:07:21,009
Actually, Captain,
I'm quite busy today.

162
00:07:21,011 --> 00:07:22,978
This is a John Doe,
and we got nothing.

163
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,247
And, like you just said,
you're my consultant.

164
00:07:25,249 --> 00:07:26,748
So, go consult.

165
00:07:29,787 --> 00:07:30,986
Watson.

166
00:07:30,988 --> 00:07:32,588
Um, he's your friend.

167
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,523
Actually, Kitty is
otherwise engaged,

168
00:07:34,525 --> 00:07:37,426
and he did actually help both
of us with a case last year.

169
00:07:37,428 --> 00:07:38,493
Did he not?

170
00:07:40,865 --> 00:07:44,099
Have I told you
how good it is to see you?

171
00:07:44,101 --> 00:07:45,367
Yes, you have.
Three times.

172
00:07:45,369 --> 00:07:46,468
Well, it is.

173
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,636
Hey, lousy circumstances.

174
00:07:47,638 --> 00:07:49,371
But, uh, hey...

175
00:07:49,373 --> 00:07:51,740
I heard from your boss that you
just, uh, got back from London.

176
00:07:51,742 --> 00:07:53,308
Were you working
a case or...?

177
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,576
No, I moved back there.

178
00:07:54,578 --> 00:07:55,677
You mean<i> moved,</i> moved?

179
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:56,845
Is there another
definition?

180
00:07:56,847 --> 00:07:58,513
I was there for
eight months,

181
00:07:58,515 --> 00:08:00,883
and had a change of heart
and returned to New York.

182
00:08:00,885 --> 00:08:02,517
So, you moved to London,
and you didn't, uh...

183
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,086
You know what?
Doesn't even matter.

184
00:08:04,088 --> 00:08:05,387
The point is you're back!

185
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:07,389
Mr. Emple.
Uh, duty calls.

186
00:08:07,391 --> 00:08:09,024
Yeah.

187
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:18,634
It's interesting.

188
00:08:18,636 --> 00:08:20,068
Mothballs are interesting?

189
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,070
They were taken from
that cabinet over there.

190
00:08:22,072 --> 00:08:25,941
Obviously, to cover the smell
of John Doe's decay.

191
00:08:25,943 --> 00:08:28,043
The killer didn't
bring them with him.

192
00:08:28,045 --> 00:08:31,179
Perhaps leaving the body here
was not part of his plan, hmm?

193
00:08:32,983 --> 00:08:36,018
Doe was shot in the foot
first and then the knee.

194
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,453
Either those were
two really bad misses or...

195
00:08:38,455 --> 00:08:41,256
Or the killer was torturing him.

196
00:08:41,258 --> 00:08:43,892
This doesn't seem like anything
you can't handle on your own.

197
00:08:43,894 --> 00:08:45,994
So you want to tell me why you
really asked me to come here?

198
00:08:45,996 --> 00:08:48,363
“This doesn't seem like anything
you can't handle on your own.”

199
00:08:48,365 --> 00:08:49,765
That's funny.

200
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:51,566
That's exactly what
I would have said

201
00:08:51,568 --> 00:08:53,602
had I been present when you
asked Kitty for her assistance

202
00:08:53,604 --> 00:08:54,937
with your tawdry side job.

203
00:08:54,939 --> 00:08:57,372
“Tawdry”?
I wanted you to know I approve.

204
00:08:57,374 --> 00:08:59,007
Of what?

205
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:01,376
Your agenda
with regards to Kitty.

206
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:03,078
Several days ago,
I gave you her file.

207
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,913
And then you show up at
the brownstone yesterday,

208
00:09:04,915 --> 00:09:06,515
and you invite her
into an investigation.

209
00:09:06,517 --> 00:09:08,183
Coincidence? No, I think not.

210
00:09:08,185 --> 00:09:11,320
You feel for her.
And now you wish to engage.

211
00:09:11,322 --> 00:09:13,956
It's not an outcome
I would have predicted, no.

212
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,458
But it is one
I approve of, yeah.

213
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,193
She could learn
a great deal from you,

214
00:09:18,195 --> 00:09:20,228
especially with regards
to how to get the most

215
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,864
from my tutelage.

216
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:25,734
So, I've already dispatched her
to, uh, follow your Mr. Keswick.

217
00:09:25,736 --> 00:09:27,836
But that's not
what I actually...

218
00:09:27,838 --> 00:09:29,404
Harlan!

219
00:09:30,741 --> 00:09:33,075
You came here to retrieve
a phone number, did you not?

220
00:09:33,077 --> 00:09:34,609
You would send a text,
and then receive

221
00:09:34,611 --> 00:09:36,845
the next clue in the game
that you were playing.

222
00:09:36,847 --> 00:09:38,747
Yeah, but I didn't find it.

223
00:09:38,749 --> 00:09:40,048
Not that I kept looking

224
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,250
after the dead guy
fell out of the locker.

225
00:09:42,252 --> 00:09:44,052
Yeah, CSU didn't find
any number either.

226
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:46,154
Probably because
it's under that paint.

227
00:09:46,156 --> 00:09:48,190
It's fresh.

228
00:09:48,192 --> 00:09:49,891
Applied in the last

229
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:52,694
24 hours.

230
00:09:52,696 --> 00:09:54,696
Right after John Doe's murder,
I'd wager.

231
00:09:54,698 --> 00:09:57,099
You don't think
this was a mob hit?

232
00:09:57,101 --> 00:09:59,101
Doe and the killer were
playing the game, too.

233
00:09:59,103 --> 00:10:01,203
The killer shot Doe and
then covered up the number

234
00:10:01,205 --> 00:10:02,704
so no one else could use it.

235
00:10:02,706 --> 00:10:04,806
What's the prize
in your little contest?

236
00:10:04,808 --> 00:10:07,576
Well, I'm doing it
mostly for the math.

237
00:10:07,578 --> 00:10:11,480
But, uh, $1,707,071.

238
00:10:11,482 --> 00:10:13,882
It's another
palindromic prime.

239
00:10:13,884 --> 00:10:17,152
Did I not mention the
money at the station?

240
00:10:17,154 --> 00:10:18,587
Who the hell can afford

241
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:20,655
that kind of payout
for a puzzle hunt?

242
00:10:20,657 --> 00:10:22,124
Well, most people
think it's CAML.

243
00:10:22,126 --> 00:10:24,593
The Center for Applied
Mathematics and Logic.

244
00:10:24,595 --> 00:10:26,094
It's located
in Ramapo...

245
00:10:26,096 --> 00:10:27,729
Wait, most people
“think” it's them?

246
00:10:27,731 --> 00:10:29,331
Well, hunts like these,

247
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,266
the organizers are
almost always anonymous.

248
00:10:31,268 --> 00:10:32,401
It's S.O.P.

249
00:10:32,403 --> 00:10:34,302
What about the
contestants?

250
00:10:34,304 --> 00:10:37,005
Is anonymity
also S.O.P.?

251
00:10:37,007 --> 00:10:39,207
For the most part, yeah.

252
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:43,078
But, guys, math peeps
are my peeps, okay?

253
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,314
It's, uh, like
a community, sort of.

254
00:10:46,316 --> 00:10:48,984
I can think of ten
or 12 other people

255
00:10:48,986 --> 00:10:50,018
who were probably competing.

256
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,186
Would that help?

257
00:10:53,157 --> 00:10:55,223
No.

258
00:10:55,225 --> 00:10:58,026
I'm sorry, I don't know him.

259
00:10:58,028 --> 00:11:00,862
But you admit you were
competing in Belphegor's Prime.

260
00:11:00,864 --> 00:11:02,197
I do.

261
00:11:04,835 --> 00:11:05,934
Pepe!

262
00:11:08,172 --> 00:11:10,439
Sorry. He doesn't
like strangers.

263
00:11:12,109 --> 00:11:14,443
Give him one of these.

264
00:11:14,445 --> 00:11:16,111
Get on his good side.

265
00:11:24,288 --> 00:11:26,354
What are you doing?

266
00:11:28,225 --> 00:11:30,725
I'm just verifying that
you've been lying to us.

267
00:11:30,727 --> 00:11:33,895
You did know the
dead man, did you not?

268
00:11:33,897 --> 00:11:36,998
I reviewed his personal
effects at the morgue earlier.

269
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,034
The coroner reported finding
crumbs in one of his pockets.

270
00:11:39,036 --> 00:11:40,036
I tasted one.

271
00:11:40,037 --> 00:11:41,269
Why would you...?

272
00:11:41,271 --> 00:11:42,771
At first, I thought
they were from

273
00:11:42,773 --> 00:11:44,439
a particularly rancid
brand of cheese,

274
00:11:44,441 --> 00:11:47,609
but, no... they're from
one of Pepe's treats.

275
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:49,277
Homemade?

276
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,481
Harlan was able to give us
the names of nine other people

277
00:11:52,483 --> 00:11:54,149
he believed to be
other competitors.

278
00:11:54,151 --> 00:11:55,984
Our colleagues are
investigating them as we speak,

279
00:11:55,986 --> 00:11:57,919
but I'll quite happily
recommend that the NYPD

280
00:11:57,921 --> 00:12:00,222
focus its attention
entirely on you.

281
00:12:04,128 --> 00:12:06,428
His name was Ike Walaczek.

282
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,231
In another lifetime,
he was my boyfriend.

283
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:10,866
And what of
this lifetime?

284
00:12:10,868 --> 00:12:12,701
We were working together.

285
00:12:12,703 --> 00:12:14,769
On Belphegor's.
What?!

286
00:12:14,771 --> 00:12:16,705
He was a numerical analyst
at the Tory Foundation.

287
00:12:16,707 --> 00:12:17,873
I work mostly in combinatorics.

288
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,307
I thought we would make
a good team.

289
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:20,742
But there aren't
supposed to be teams.

290
00:12:20,744 --> 00:12:22,711
Not in a puzzle hunt.
It's bad form.

291
00:12:22,713 --> 00:12:23,713
Harlan...

292
00:12:23,714 --> 00:12:25,514
I'm just saying...

293
00:12:25,516 --> 00:12:27,315
My husband
wouldn't understand,

294
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:30,385
so I decided I wouldn't tell him
until after we won the money.

295
00:12:30,387 --> 00:12:33,121
A team-- so that's how
you got there before me.

296
00:12:33,123 --> 00:12:34,489
I wasn't there.

297
00:12:34,491 --> 00:12:36,258
Tom and I were out of town
until this morning.

298
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,126
His cousin
was getting married in Hawaii.

299
00:12:38,128 --> 00:12:40,662
That's why Ike went
to the coordinates by himself.

300
00:12:40,664 --> 00:12:42,097
Because I couldn't.

301
00:12:44,268 --> 00:12:46,601
These are pictures I took.

302
00:12:46,603 --> 00:12:49,337
Check the dates.

303
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:51,506
You gave the police
nine other names?

304
00:12:51,508 --> 00:12:53,408
People you thought
were competing?

305
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,776
I've got 16.

306
00:12:54,778 --> 00:12:56,311
And I know they were competing.

307
00:12:58,448 --> 00:13:01,249
He talked to her
outside the Jamaica property

308
00:13:01,251 --> 00:13:05,720
for about 20 minutes,
and then this truck rolled up.

309
00:13:05,722 --> 00:13:07,822
Any idea what's
inside the crate?

310
00:13:07,824 --> 00:13:09,024
Nope.

311
00:13:09,026 --> 00:13:10,392
I can't identify
the woman either.

312
00:13:10,394 --> 00:13:12,260
Everything about her
said money though.

313
00:13:12,262 --> 00:13:15,363
She, Keswick
and the mystery box

314
00:13:15,365 --> 00:13:17,732
stayed inside the building
for about three hours,

315
00:13:17,734 --> 00:13:20,001
and then off they went.

316
00:13:20,904 --> 00:13:22,170
Good.

317
00:13:22,172 --> 00:13:23,872
Okay.

318
00:13:23,874 --> 00:13:26,074
You know where
to send the check.

319
00:13:26,076 --> 00:13:30,145
You haven't asked me about
the file Sherlock gave me.

320
00:13:30,147 --> 00:13:32,080
Why would I?

321
00:13:32,082 --> 00:13:36,184
You said it would give me
a better sense of you-- it did.

322
00:13:37,588 --> 00:13:40,155
That's why you asked
for my help.

323
00:13:40,157 --> 00:13:41,990
Because you felt sorry for me.

324
00:13:41,992 --> 00:13:44,226
No.

325
00:13:44,228 --> 00:13:46,194
You just don't seem interested
in anything

326
00:13:46,196 --> 00:13:48,063
outside of becoming
a detective.

327
00:13:48,065 --> 00:13:50,999
There she is.

328
00:13:51,001 --> 00:13:53,301
The old counselor.

329
00:13:53,303 --> 00:13:55,637
Who used to hold
Sherlock's hand.

330
00:13:57,608 --> 00:13:59,741
Everything that you read,

331
00:13:59,743 --> 00:14:02,510
everything that happened to me,
that's all it is.

332
00:14:02,512 --> 00:14:04,646
It's just something
that happened.

333
00:14:04,648 --> 00:14:08,116
And it's all
in the past now.

334
00:14:08,118 --> 00:14:10,685
So let's just
leave it there, shall we?

335
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:24,667
Hello.

336
00:14:24,668 --> 00:14:26,001
You've had sex.

337
00:14:26,003 --> 00:14:27,202
Excuse me?

338
00:14:27,204 --> 00:14:28,503
I can hear it
in your voice.

339
00:14:28,505 --> 00:14:29,771
You've joined paunches.

340
00:14:29,773 --> 00:14:30,972
Good for you, Watson.

341
00:14:30,974 --> 00:14:32,807
As you know, I think
the act of love

342
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:34,676
can be quite conducive to...
What do you want?

343
00:14:34,678 --> 00:14:36,911
Merely to apprise you
of a new development

344
00:14:36,913 --> 00:14:38,280
in the murder of
Ike Walaczek.

345
00:14:38,282 --> 00:14:40,115
As I informed
you yesterday,

346
00:14:40,117 --> 00:14:42,284
Harlan and I were given
a new list of competitors.

347
00:14:42,286 --> 00:14:45,320
One name leapt out:
Byron Lowenthal.

348
00:14:45,322 --> 00:14:48,156
He's a statistician at the
Public Utilities Commission

349
00:14:48,158 --> 00:14:50,425
and a diagnosed
paranoid schizophrenic.

350
00:14:50,427 --> 00:14:52,160
He's been hospitalized
for becoming violent

351
00:14:52,162 --> 00:14:53,728
on no fewer
than three occasions.

352
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,964
Certainly sounds like
it could be our guy.

353
00:14:55,966 --> 00:14:59,367
Unfortunately, Mr. Lowenthal had
another break earlier this year.

354
00:14:59,369 --> 00:15:02,137
He's been staying in
a transient hotel ever since.

355
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:04,239
Detective Bell and I
are going to speak with him.

356
00:15:04,241 --> 00:15:05,307
You want me to meet you?

357
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:06,875
Oh, no, we're already here.

358
00:15:06,877 --> 00:15:08,410
Anyway, now that I know
that you've enjoyed coitus

359
00:15:08,412 --> 00:15:09,778
and could enjoy more
in the near future...

360
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,846
When you're done,
we need to talk.

361
00:15:14,718 --> 00:15:16,818
Byron Lowenthal,
you in there?

362
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,053
Who is it?

363
00:15:18,055 --> 00:15:19,754
It's Detective Bell, NYPD.

364
00:15:19,756 --> 00:15:22,257
My colleague and I would like
to ask you some questions.

365
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:24,592
Let me
get some pants on.

366
00:15:37,341 --> 00:15:40,008
S-Sorry, I just... I, um...

367
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,310
I-I thought I heard
Mr. Lowenthal retr...

368
00:16:19,154 --> 00:16:21,267
You guys got lucky.

369
00:16:21,268 --> 00:16:22,868
Well, luck had little
to do with it, actually.

370
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,536
I... I heard Mr. Lowenthal

371
00:16:24,538 --> 00:16:27,039
pulling a heavy object off
a shelf, placing it on his bed,

372
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,041
and the sound of
the zipper indicated

373
00:16:29,043 --> 00:16:30,976
that it was
a large gun case.

374
00:16:30,978 --> 00:16:33,579
Looks like he was sane enough
to do math, but not much else.

375
00:16:33,581 --> 00:16:34,747
Plus, he was
pretty hopped up.

376
00:16:34,749 --> 00:16:36,448
Caffeine pills,
energy drinks,

377
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,251
pretty much every legal
stimulant you can buy.

378
00:16:39,253 --> 00:16:40,853
Plus a few illegal ones.

379
00:16:40,855 --> 00:16:42,821
Hmm. Obviously, he was
keeping himself awake

380
00:16:42,823 --> 00:16:44,490
so he could work on
Belphegor's.

381
00:16:44,492 --> 00:16:47,392
This... is obvious to you?

382
00:16:47,394 --> 00:16:48,961
I confess the maths
are beyond me,

383
00:16:48,963 --> 00:16:51,130
but I took the liberty of
sending pictures of what

384
00:16:51,132 --> 00:16:52,865
appear to be Mr. Lowenthal's
most recent scribbles

385
00:16:52,867 --> 00:16:54,166
to Harlan Emple,
and he's confirmed

386
00:16:54,168 --> 00:16:55,667
they are part of the contest.

387
00:16:55,669 --> 00:16:56,969
With your permission,
I'd like copies of these

388
00:16:56,971 --> 00:16:58,837
sent to my home
so he can review them.

389
00:16:58,839 --> 00:16:59,972
What for?

390
00:16:59,974 --> 00:17:01,073
If Byron Lowenthal

391
00:17:01,075 --> 00:17:02,441
did kill Ike Walaczek,

392
00:17:02,443 --> 00:17:04,109
then he used
and obscured a phone number,

393
00:17:04,111 --> 00:17:05,878
which would have yielded
the next problem.

394
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,379
That problem's solution

395
00:17:07,381 --> 00:17:08,714
would be GPS coordinates.

396
00:17:08,716 --> 00:17:10,415
If he's recorded them
in his books...

397
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:12,551
Your pal will be able to tell us
where he's headed next.

398
00:17:12,553 --> 00:17:14,853
I'll get our guys to give you

399
00:17:14,855 --> 00:17:16,388
whatever you need.

400
00:17:17,258 --> 00:17:18,991
Scans are still coming through,

401
00:17:18,993 --> 00:17:21,260
but I've put what we've got
so far up on the wall.

402
00:17:21,262 --> 00:17:23,262
Sherlock said that
you prefer it that way.

403
00:17:23,264 --> 00:17:25,030
Picked it up from him,
actually.

404
00:17:25,032 --> 00:17:28,600
Makes me feel like I'm really
inside of the problem.

405
00:17:30,704 --> 00:17:33,372
I'll, uh, let you know
if I need anything.

406
00:17:34,275 --> 00:17:35,974
Oh, I work without a shirt.

407
00:17:35,976 --> 00:17:38,911
Sometimes makes me feel
closer to the numbers.

408
00:17:38,913 --> 00:17:42,147
You'll need to, uh,
check the printer in the study

409
00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:43,615
for more pages.

410
00:17:43,617 --> 00:17:45,417
Uh, this is nice,
you know?

411
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:47,452
Meeting another member
of the team.

412
00:17:47,454 --> 00:17:48,654
You know, Team Sherlock.

413
00:17:48,656 --> 00:17:50,656
You help him, I help him...

414
00:17:51,926 --> 00:17:53,559
Obviously, you haven't
tackled a case

415
00:17:53,561 --> 00:17:55,093
with high-order math since
you started working with him,

416
00:17:55,095 --> 00:17:57,729
or we would've...

417
00:17:57,731 --> 00:17:59,031
What?

418
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:00,232
What?

419
00:18:00,234 --> 00:18:01,834
Wait...

420
00:18:01,836 --> 00:18:04,002
have you worked a case
with high-order math?

421
00:18:04,805 --> 00:18:06,238
You have, haven't you?

422
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,840
Does it matter?

423
00:18:07,842 --> 00:18:09,842
Of course it...

424
00:18:09,844 --> 00:18:11,443
Oh, my God.

425
00:18:11,445 --> 00:18:13,278
Did he fire me?

426
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,980
All I know
is that back in London,

427
00:18:14,982 --> 00:18:16,982
we worked a case that involved
Fibonacci spirals...

428
00:18:16,984 --> 00:18:18,483
He fired me.

429
00:18:18,485 --> 00:18:21,386
...and he called some woman
named Indira Patel.

430
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,856
She's at Berkeley.

431
00:18:23,858 --> 00:18:25,624
I'm three time zones closer!

432
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:27,125
You're here now.

433
00:18:27,127 --> 00:18:29,428
Sure, because I found
a dead body.

434
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,531
I have to go; I have to run
some errands for Sherlock.

435
00:18:35,936 --> 00:18:37,903
I-I don't know
what was in the crate,

436
00:18:37,905 --> 00:18:39,271
but the stenciling on
the side indicates

437
00:18:39,273 --> 00:18:40,772
it came from one of
the SUNY schools.

438
00:18:40,774 --> 00:18:42,908
I put another detective
on Keswick...

439
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:45,177
Don't kill me, I had to
use your razor to shave.

440
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:47,179
I...

441
00:18:47,181 --> 00:18:49,147
You must be Andrew.

442
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:50,515
Sherlock Holmes.

443
00:18:50,517 --> 00:18:52,551
Sorry.

444
00:18:52,553 --> 00:18:55,487
Joan said you were coming;
I... I forgot.

445
00:18:55,489 --> 00:18:57,122
It's not how
I wanted to meet you.

446
00:18:57,124 --> 00:18:58,891
She said you can tell
a lot about people

447
00:18:58,893 --> 00:19:00,192
just by looking at them.

448
00:19:00,194 --> 00:19:02,261
I swear, I...
usually wear pants.

449
00:19:02,263 --> 00:19:03,729
Well, in my experience,
most people

450
00:19:03,731 --> 00:19:05,264
need only be concerned
I won't notice

451
00:19:05,266 --> 00:19:06,498
anything worth remarking upon.

452
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:10,535
Watson seems adequately sexed.

453
00:19:11,939 --> 00:19:13,672
Hey.

454
00:19:13,674 --> 00:19:15,674
I was just introducing myself.

455
00:19:17,945 --> 00:19:20,379
I've got that thing.
I'll see you tonight.

456
00:19:20,381 --> 00:19:21,580
Okay.

457
00:19:27,855 --> 00:19:30,188
Your home, Watson...

458
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,823
it's utterly pleasant.

459
00:19:31,825 --> 00:19:33,692
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

460
00:19:33,694 --> 00:19:35,394
When you told me
you wanted a life of your own,

461
00:19:35,396 --> 00:19:36,595
I didn't realize
that you meant you wanted

462
00:19:36,597 --> 00:19:38,030
the same life everyone else has.

463
00:19:38,032 --> 00:19:39,464
But at any rate,
none of my business, is it?

464
00:19:39,466 --> 00:19:41,233
It's not.
And I didn't ask you here

465
00:19:41,235 --> 00:19:42,634
to talk about my apartment.

466
00:19:42,636 --> 00:19:44,970
No, you asked me here
to discuss Kitty.

467
00:19:44,972 --> 00:19:46,471
If she were not
the topic of conversation,

468
00:19:46,473 --> 00:19:48,941
then you wouldn't have
invited me to your home,

469
00:19:48,943 --> 00:19:50,776
where there's no chance
she'll be present.

470
00:19:52,346 --> 00:19:53,946
She disappointed you
in some way.

471
00:19:53,948 --> 00:19:55,247
Skills not up to snuff?

472
00:19:55,249 --> 00:19:57,316
Please remember
she is a novice.

473
00:19:57,318 --> 00:19:58,850
Actually, she did a great job.

474
00:19:58,852 --> 00:20:00,285
But I have some concerns.

475
00:20:00,287 --> 00:20:01,954
I thought we could
talk about them.

476
00:20:03,757 --> 00:20:04,923
You think that
Kitty needs help

477
00:20:04,925 --> 00:20:06,091
above and beyond
my mentorship.

478
00:20:06,093 --> 00:20:07,392
You read the same
file I did.

479
00:20:07,394 --> 00:20:08,894
She's a rape victim.

480
00:20:08,896 --> 00:20:11,296
She was kept and tortured.

481
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,899
Mm.

482
00:20:16,136 --> 00:20:19,171
You know me, so surely you know

483
00:20:19,173 --> 00:20:22,874
I've broached the subject of
a support group meeting before.

484
00:20:22,876 --> 00:20:25,010
Even offered
to pay for therapy.

485
00:20:25,012 --> 00:20:26,812
She's not interested, I know.

486
00:20:26,814 --> 00:20:28,447
Just as you also know

487
00:20:28,449 --> 00:20:30,749
someone with a problem
can't be forced to get help.

488
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:32,551
They have to want it.

489
00:20:32,553 --> 00:20:34,786
What Kitty wants
is to be a detective.

490
00:20:36,523 --> 00:20:38,490
I am taking pains
to try and channel

491
00:20:38,492 --> 00:20:40,592
her residual feelings
into her work.

492
00:20:42,329 --> 00:20:44,463
Well, that works out
great for you.

493
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:48,400
You told me that
you took on a partner

494
00:20:48,402 --> 00:20:50,635
because you wanted to replicate
what you and I had.

495
00:20:50,637 --> 00:20:52,637
That you thought it helped
with your recovery.

496
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:54,539
You think I would
try and take advantage

497
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,208
of the victim of a trauma?

498
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,910
Of course not, but there is
a conflict of interest here.

499
00:20:58,912 --> 00:21:02,447
She needs what she needs,
but you need what you need, too.

500
00:21:06,053 --> 00:21:10,055
It's-it's good that you're
in her life now, Watson.

501
00:21:10,057 --> 00:21:12,524
I mean,
it's commonly believed that, um,

502
00:21:12,526 --> 00:21:16,228
a child benefits mostly from
the presence of two parents.

503
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,164
He-- or she, in this case--
can absorb certain qualities

504
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,466
from the father--
clear-eyed view of the world,

505
00:21:21,468 --> 00:21:23,168
capacity of
rational thought, etcetera.

506
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,170
They can also absorb certain
qualities from the mother.

507
00:21:25,172 --> 00:21:27,105
Excuse me, but I am not
Kitty's mother,

508
00:21:27,107 --> 00:21:28,807
and she sure as hell
is not our child.

509
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:30,942
You brought her here;
she looks up to you.

510
00:21:30,944 --> 00:21:32,944
She says that she doesn't
need help-- fine--

511
00:21:32,946 --> 00:21:34,579
but you know better.

512
00:21:34,581 --> 00:21:37,082
And you're gonna have to be
the one that tells her.

513
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,620
It's Harlan.

514
00:21:41,622 --> 00:21:44,523
Making progress with the maths.

515
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,660
We thought
that Byron and Ike

516
00:21:48,662 --> 00:21:50,462
arrived at Portal Ten
simultaneously.

517
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,664
That would've meant that they
were doing all the same math

518
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,032
at essentially
the same time.

519
00:21:54,034 --> 00:21:56,001
Only, the math
you found at Byron's place

520
00:21:56,003 --> 00:21:57,003
says that's wrong.

521
00:21:57,004 --> 00:21:58,470
He was one step behind Ike.

522
00:21:58,472 --> 00:22:00,705
Are you proposing he did
not kill Mr. Walaczek?

523
00:22:00,707 --> 00:22:03,175
I don't know, but that's
not the weirdest part.

524
00:22:03,177 --> 00:22:04,810
Byron was obsessive.

525
00:22:04,812 --> 00:22:06,211
He time-stamped
almost everything he did.

526
00:22:06,213 --> 00:22:09,047
He only solved
the Portal Nine problem,

527
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:11,316
the same problem that sent me
to that old factory last night.

528
00:22:11,318 --> 00:22:12,884
But get this--

529
00:22:12,886 --> 00:22:14,686
he wasn't given
the same problem as me.

530
00:22:14,688 --> 00:22:16,655
And so it would've yielded
GPS coordinates

531
00:22:16,657 --> 00:22:18,323
for an entirely
different location.

532
00:22:18,325 --> 00:22:21,760
The person in charge of
the game changed the clue

533
00:22:21,762 --> 00:22:23,328
after the police
found Ike's body.

534
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:25,964
Well, he had to, right?

535
00:22:25,966 --> 00:22:27,899
If he hadn't, he would be
sending other competitors

536
00:22:27,901 --> 00:22:29,101
to an active crime scene.

537
00:22:29,103 --> 00:22:30,402
The important thing is

538
00:22:30,404 --> 00:22:31,536
I figured out the coordinates

539
00:22:31,538 --> 00:22:32,771
to the second location.

540
00:22:32,773 --> 00:22:35,540
I know where Byron went.

541
00:22:35,542 --> 00:22:36,842
What are you doing?

542
00:22:36,844 --> 00:22:38,410
You're saying he
time-stamped everything.

543
00:22:38,412 --> 00:22:40,345
I'm looking at the time
he received his clues.

544
00:22:40,347 --> 00:22:42,647
It's all there, to the second,
but what does that have to do...

545
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:44,149
What if you hadn't
found a body?

546
00:22:44,151 --> 00:22:46,118
If the game had
proceeded as planned,

547
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,486
what were you meant
to do there?

548
00:22:47,488 --> 00:22:49,354
I would have sent a text
to the phone number,

549
00:22:49,356 --> 00:22:51,523
the one that the killer painted
over, and then I would have

550
00:22:51,525 --> 00:22:52,891
gotten a message back
with the next problem.

551
00:22:52,893 --> 00:22:54,559
There's an extra
step in there.

552
00:22:54,561 --> 00:22:56,428
Why all this rigmarole with
phone numbers and texts?

553
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,064
Why not just post the problem
itself at the factory?

554
00:22:59,066 --> 00:23:02,100
I don't know, it's just the way
the game is played.

555
00:23:02,102 --> 00:23:04,102
They're for an old
industrial area in Queens.

556
00:23:04,104 --> 00:23:06,805
You're welcome
for finding your suspect.

557
00:23:06,807 --> 00:23:09,207
If I'm right, Harlan,
what you've found...

558
00:23:09,209 --> 00:23:11,109
is the site of
another murder.

559
00:23:11,111 --> 00:23:13,245
Byron Lowenthal's.

560
00:23:15,983 --> 00:23:18,216
You were right,
Lowenthal's dead.

561
00:23:18,218 --> 00:23:20,952
He was shot in the foot,
then the knee.

562
00:23:20,954 --> 00:23:22,821
Just like
Ike Wallaczek.

563
00:23:22,823 --> 00:23:26,391
I'm, uh, gonna look
over here now.

564
00:23:26,393 --> 00:23:29,427
Well, we think the perp
was pulling the body

565
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:31,429
to a car that was parked
over there.

566
00:23:31,431 --> 00:23:34,065
Then he just
left him here.

567
00:23:34,067 --> 00:23:35,901
Probably afraid
he'd been spotted.

568
00:23:35,903 --> 00:23:38,803
There's a lot
of homeless in the area.

569
00:23:41,441 --> 00:23:43,008
Question is:

570
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:45,010
how'd you know
Lowenthal was the next victim

571
00:23:45,012 --> 00:23:46,511
and not the killer?

572
00:23:49,316 --> 00:23:51,750
Well, that's
quite simple, really.

573
00:23:51,752 --> 00:23:54,352
The game is directing
its players to remote locales,

574
00:23:54,354 --> 00:23:56,788
and then instructing them
to send a text message

575
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,256
indicating their presence.

576
00:23:58,258 --> 00:24:00,125
I suspect the killer wanted
to remove the body

577
00:24:00,127 --> 00:24:02,928
so he could keep this new
location “in play,” so to speak.

578
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:05,130
Still missing the “simple” part.

579
00:24:05,132 --> 00:24:06,698
The late Mr. Lowenthal

580
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,366
received his final clue

581
00:24:08,368 --> 00:24:10,235
after Harlan discovered
Ike Wallaczek's body,

582
00:24:10,237 --> 00:24:12,737
but before news of the killing
had reached the media.

583
00:24:12,739 --> 00:24:14,439
That means the
game's designer

584
00:24:14,441 --> 00:24:16,408
knew the location
had been compromised.

585
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,577
And the only way
that he could have known that,

586
00:24:18,579 --> 00:24:20,111
at the time that he knew it,

587
00:24:20,113 --> 00:24:21,880
was if he, himself,
was the killer.

588
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,917
Belphegor's Prime is not
a treasure hunt.

589
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,619
It's a trap.

590
00:24:40,696 --> 00:24:42,196
Better?

591
00:24:42,198 --> 00:24:44,665
False alarm.

592
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:47,668
But I still feel
a little queasy.

593
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,273
This new dead guy--

594
00:24:52,275 --> 00:24:54,875
your friend said that he was
tortured, too, right?

595
00:24:54,877 --> 00:24:57,244
Right before the killer tried
to abscond with his corpse.

596
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:59,213
I assume
he intended to take

597
00:24:59,215 --> 00:25:02,383
Ike Wallaczek away with him
as well, only Ike was too large.

598
00:25:02,385 --> 00:25:04,685
A speedy mothballing
was the best he could do.

599
00:25:04,687 --> 00:25:07,221
So, just to recap,

600
00:25:07,223 --> 00:25:09,657
I've spent the last
few months of my life

601
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:13,360
playing a game that was
designed to kill me.

602
00:25:13,362 --> 00:25:15,629
Got to be a metaphor
in there somewhere, right?

603
00:25:15,631 --> 00:25:18,966
I think the word you're
looking for is “moral.”

604
00:25:18,968 --> 00:25:21,902
There is a moral in there:
games are for idiots.

605
00:25:24,707 --> 00:25:26,473
Breaking news from Ramapo.

606
00:25:26,475 --> 00:25:29,443
Kitty reports the Center for
Applied Mathematics and Logic

607
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,912
is not the sponsor
of Belphegor's Prime.

608
00:25:31,914 --> 00:25:34,148
Then it's got to be
a serial killer, right?

609
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,716
Someone who's obsessed
with mathematicians?

610
00:25:35,718 --> 00:25:37,284
Mm.

611
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,920
Perhaps he was bullied
by mathematicians as a child.

612
00:25:39,922 --> 00:25:42,056
Or mathematicians
killed his parents.

613
00:25:42,058 --> 00:25:43,657
I'm being serious.

614
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:45,726
Serial killers who devise
elaborate death traps

615
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,461
are the stuff of pulp fiction.

616
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:49,229
And besides, with respect
to these murders,

617
00:25:49,231 --> 00:25:51,165
there are none
of the elaborations

618
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:53,767
which mark that sort of culprit.

619
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:55,970
If anything, I would describe
the work as businesslike.

620
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:58,172
Then it's the government.

621
00:25:58,174 --> 00:26:01,241
I mean, the-the game was some
sort of test to weed out people

622
00:26:01,243 --> 00:26:03,243
who could weaponize math.

623
00:26:03,245 --> 00:26:05,179
The American intelligence
apparatus may be clod-like,

624
00:26:05,181 --> 00:26:07,014
but I think they would
do a better job

625
00:26:07,016 --> 00:26:08,749
of disposing of two bodies,
don't you?

626
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:11,785
Watson?

627
00:26:11,787 --> 00:26:13,621
I just heard
from one of the suspects

628
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:14,922
Marcus and I talked to
yesterday,

629
00:26:14,924 --> 00:26:16,290
another puzzle-hunter.

630
00:26:16,292 --> 00:26:18,525
Tell me he confessed
to the murders.

631
00:26:18,527 --> 00:26:20,427
We ruled him out right away,
but he heard about

632
00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:22,329
Byron Lowenthal's murder on
the news and wanted me to know

633
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:25,165
he's at a friend's place,
some guy named Paul.

634
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,934
That is fascinating.

635
00:26:26,936 --> 00:26:28,369
Actually, it might be.

636
00:26:28,371 --> 00:26:31,038
Paul is positive he knows
who the killer is.

637
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,807
I know the guards
are a bit much,

638
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:35,509
but I wanted everyone
to feel safe.

639
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:38,178
And, besides,
math has been good to me.

640
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,279
Commodities.

641
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:40,848
So, you and your friends,

642
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:43,150
you were competitors
in Belphegor's Prime?

643
00:26:43,152 --> 00:26:45,352
Most of us. Some of the others
are just here for the math.

644
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,121
You said you could
identify the killer.

645
00:26:47,123 --> 00:26:49,323
I can, sort of.

646
00:26:52,061 --> 00:26:54,194
“Mo Shellshocker.”

647
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:56,930
It's a pseudonym,
obviously, but I'm telling you,

648
00:26:56,932 --> 00:26:58,365
this is the guy
you're looking for.

649
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,600
I've heard of him.

650
00:26:59,602 --> 00:27:01,335
He uses his blog
to expose bad math.

651
00:27:01,337 --> 00:27:03,837
Corrupt economists, biased
pollsters, that sort of thing.

652
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:05,572
He's actually
sort of a crusader.

653
00:27:05,574 --> 00:27:06,574
He's a murderer.

654
00:27:06,575 --> 00:27:09,143
How can you be
so sure?

655
00:27:09,145 --> 00:27:10,744
When he isn't crusading,
he's competing in puzzle hunts.

656
00:27:10,746 --> 00:27:11,812
A few months ago,

657
00:27:11,814 --> 00:27:13,080
he claimed to
have solved

658
00:27:13,082 --> 00:27:14,815
Cicada 3301 two
years in a row.

659
00:27:14,817 --> 00:27:17,484
Some people called BS,
including...

660
00:27:17,486 --> 00:27:20,120
Ike Wallaczek
and Byron Lowenthal.

661
00:27:20,122 --> 00:27:21,221
“WallaCheckYourMath,”

662
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:22,489
“ByLow2020.”

663
00:27:22,491 --> 00:27:23,757
Those are their
online handles.

664
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:25,392
Their friends
will confirm it.

665
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,528
A flame war does not
a murderer make.

666
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:30,097
The stuff these guys were
slinging at each other was ugly.

667
00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:32,099
Mo knew they were into hunts,
and so he built one

668
00:27:32,101 --> 00:27:34,034
that would send them to places
where he could kill them.

669
00:27:34,036 --> 00:27:35,469
That's what we're
doing here is

670
00:27:35,471 --> 00:27:36,837
we're just sifting
through all the math

671
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:38,338
he's posted on his blog
over the years,

672
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,840
to see if we could
find his signature

673
00:27:39,842 --> 00:27:41,975
or something that
could identify him.

674
00:27:41,977 --> 00:27:45,279
If two people weren't dead,
we'd probably be having fun.

675
00:27:45,281 --> 00:27:46,747
But still, the
chances that he left

676
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:48,582
something like that
in his math...

677
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,784
If it's there, we'll find it.
In the meantime,

678
00:27:50,786 --> 00:27:52,186
we thought the
police should know

679
00:27:52,188 --> 00:27:53,687
who they're really
dealing with.

680
00:27:53,689 --> 00:27:55,389
<i>I've got to go meet someone</i>

681
00:27:55,391 --> 00:27:56,924
about my other case.

682
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:59,927
You're good to pass all this
along to Marcus? Okay.

683
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:03,030
I must say, I'm surprised you
didn't offer to stay and help.

684
00:28:03,032 --> 00:28:05,265
Mr. Ettinger makes
a compelling case with respect

685
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,067
to Mo Shellshocker's
viability as a suspect.

686
00:28:07,069 --> 00:28:09,002
Mo is a genius.

687
00:28:09,004 --> 00:28:10,637
We're talking off the charts.

688
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:12,139
Leibniz meets Euler meets Gauss.

689
00:28:12,141 --> 00:28:14,108
Huh.
He may have an ego,

690
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,110
but he's not gonna kill
anyone over a few comments.

691
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:18,312
So, while “The League of
Concerned Mathematician”"

692
00:28:18,314 --> 00:28:21,014
chases its tail up there, I
am gonna do the smart thing

693
00:28:21,016 --> 00:28:22,416
and get out of town.

694
00:28:22,418 --> 00:28:24,485
You can let me know
when it all blows over.

695
00:28:24,487 --> 00:28:26,386
You're not going
anywhere, Harlan.

696
00:28:26,388 --> 00:28:29,223
Or should I call you
Mo Shellshocker?

697
00:28:32,728 --> 00:28:34,661
Did you honestly think
I wouldn't recognize

698
00:28:34,663 --> 00:28:36,130
an anagram of my own name?

699
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:40,567
I knew I should've gone
with “Choker Hell Moss”"

700
00:28:40,569 --> 00:28:42,569
But I never thought
that you would see it, okay?

701
00:28:42,571 --> 00:28:44,104
Math is my thing, not yours.

702
00:28:44,106 --> 00:28:46,473
It's my name, Harlan;
that makes it my thing.

703
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,675
It was an homage.

704
00:28:48,677 --> 00:28:50,043
Explain.

705
00:28:50,045 --> 00:28:52,045
Every day, all over the world,

706
00:28:52,047 --> 00:28:54,348
math is used to trick people.

707
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,917
Data dredging to sell
pharmaceuticals.

708
00:28:56,919 --> 00:28:59,720
Publication bias
to justify wars.

709
00:28:59,722 --> 00:29:02,322
In the wrong hands, math can be
manipulated, abused.

710
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:05,425
And I decided to do
something about it.

711
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:09,596
You catch people
who murder other people.

712
00:29:09,598 --> 00:29:11,431
I catch people who murder math.

713
00:29:11,433 --> 00:29:14,568
According to this,
Mo is a wanted man.

714
00:29:17,606 --> 00:29:19,940
Harlan?

715
00:29:19,942 --> 00:29:23,110
The D.O.D. was working
on a new fighter.

716
00:29:23,112 --> 00:29:27,047
Only, I knew that the
performance stats were bogus.

717
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:29,116
A friend of mine found
the internal numbers,

718
00:29:29,118 --> 00:29:31,251
and I sort of published them.

719
00:29:31,253 --> 00:29:33,320
So you put classified
Department of Defense documents

720
00:29:33,322 --> 00:29:34,888
on the Internet.

721
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:36,623
Isn't that what
you would have done?

722
00:29:38,928 --> 00:29:41,562
Fine! I screwed up, okay?

723
00:29:41,564 --> 00:29:43,730
But, hey, that's what I do,
right? I screw up.

724
00:29:43,732 --> 00:29:46,233
If I didn't, then probably you
wouldn't have secretly fired me.

725
00:29:46,235 --> 00:29:47,968
Excuse me?

726
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,403
I know about Indira Patel!

727
00:29:51,006 --> 00:29:53,340
I know you replaced me.

728
00:29:55,144 --> 00:29:58,979
Kitty, I think
we could use some tea.

729
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:04,318
Just tell me.

730
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,253
Tell me what math I got wrong.

731
00:30:06,255 --> 00:30:09,356
Tell me why you didn't let me
make it up to you.

732
00:30:09,358 --> 00:30:12,926
It wasn't the maths, it was you.

733
00:30:14,763 --> 00:30:18,232
Your work was impeccable.

734
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:20,334
And for the most part,
I enjoyed our collaborations.

735
00:30:20,336 --> 00:30:24,838
B-But over time, you just...
you became quite... needy.

736
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,406
What are you talking about?

737
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:29,109
Y-You asked my advice
on-on social matters,

738
00:30:29,111 --> 00:30:32,512
and you even invited me
to a party.

739
00:30:32,514 --> 00:30:34,648
You were my friend.

740
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,416
I was your employer, Harlan.

741
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:37,918
A-And you were my consultant.

742
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,419
One of many.

743
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:43,757
I know that I'm a little
obsessed with what I do.

744
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:46,960
That has always made it hard
to make friends.

745
00:30:46,962 --> 00:30:50,664
And I used to feel pretty bad
about that, and then I met you.

746
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:52,566
And I thought to myself,

747
00:30:52,568 --> 00:30:55,903
hey, if it doesn't bother him,
why should I let it bother me?

748
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:03,810
I got a lot
out of the work that we did.

749
00:31:03,812 --> 00:31:06,146
A lot.

750
00:31:06,148 --> 00:31:11,218
But if someone like you thinks
that I'm a loser, then...

751
00:31:22,564 --> 00:31:24,965
Hey, are we still doing this?

752
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:26,366
Doing what?

753
00:31:26,368 --> 00:31:28,502
Talking about the case.

754
00:31:28,504 --> 00:31:30,070
You're just sitting there.

755
00:31:30,072 --> 00:31:32,105
I'm thinking.

756
00:31:32,107 --> 00:31:34,308
I suspect the silence
is exacerbated

757
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,143
by the nature
of our communication.

758
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:37,811
Yes. Well, I don't
live there anymore.

759
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,713
So, if you want
to talk shop at night,

760
00:31:39,715 --> 00:31:41,515
this is the best I can do.

761
00:31:41,517 --> 00:31:45,252
Keep asking myself:
what did the killer want?

762
00:31:45,254 --> 00:31:48,255
He went to great lengths to lure
brilliant mathematicians

763
00:31:48,257 --> 00:31:49,489
to their deaths.

764
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,525
Winnowed out
the less gifted

765
00:31:51,527 --> 00:31:54,061
by making his problems
more and more complicated.

766
00:31:54,063 --> 00:31:57,597
He had a type, but I still think
he's a serial killer

767
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:59,266
only in the most
technical sense.

768
00:31:59,268 --> 00:32:01,201
He tortured both his victims.

769
00:32:01,203 --> 00:32:02,936
But there's no sign
that he enjoyed it.

770
00:32:02,938 --> 00:32:04,538
The work was
utilitarian,

771
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,740
suggesting it was
less for pleasure

772
00:32:06,742 --> 00:32:10,043
and more for persuasion.

773
00:32:10,045 --> 00:32:11,945
He wanted something.

774
00:32:11,947 --> 00:32:13,714
But what?

775
00:32:13,716 --> 00:32:16,483
Maybe there's a connection
between Wallaczek and Lowenthal

776
00:32:16,485 --> 00:32:18,418
we haven't spotted yet.

777
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,220
Maybe they were working
on a project together,

778
00:32:20,222 --> 00:32:21,822
something that was worth
a lot of money.

779
00:32:21,824 --> 00:32:23,857
There's no way the killer
could have predicted

780
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:26,093
which competitors would make it
to the terminal stage.

781
00:32:26,095 --> 00:32:28,795
That part of the game
was beyond his control.

782
00:32:28,797 --> 00:32:30,664
If it weren't,
he would've been prepared

783
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:33,300
to dispose of a body
the size of Ike Wallaczek's.

784
00:32:33,302 --> 00:32:35,335
So, even if there were a
connection between the victims,

785
00:32:35,337 --> 00:32:37,070
the killer could not
have counted on them

786
00:32:37,072 --> 00:32:38,839
being lured into his trap.

787
00:32:38,841 --> 00:32:41,041
Certainly not
in sequence.

788
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:45,112
His game was, in many respects,
one of chance.

789
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:51,718
Suggesting he knows what
he wants, but not who has it.

790
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,888
Like he was on a puzzle hunt
of his own.

791
00:32:56,825 --> 00:32:58,859
I'm back.

792
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:05,665
I'll set up
downstairs, yeah?

793
00:33:09,138 --> 00:33:11,238
I've been thinking about
what you said earlier.

794
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,740
I've decided to engage her
one more time

795
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:15,609
with regards
to her recuperation.

796
00:33:17,112 --> 00:33:21,815
I doubt she'll listen,
but I'll keep you apprised.

797
00:33:25,954 --> 00:33:27,421
I've been thinking.

798
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:29,623
About?
You. Your history.

799
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:31,825
Your decision
not to seek help.

800
00:33:31,827 --> 00:33:34,594
I think it's
a mistake.

801
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,530
Oh?

802
00:33:36,532 --> 00:33:38,198
I've looked into a number
of support groups.

803
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,633
As you are well aware,

804
00:33:39,635 --> 00:33:41,701
I have benefited greatly
from similar settings.

805
00:33:41,703 --> 00:33:43,270
You have.

806
00:33:43,272 --> 00:33:44,638
The process, I find,

807
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,906
is not unlike
voiding one's bowels...

808
00:33:45,908 --> 00:33:47,808
I'll go.
What?

809
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:49,676
I'll go.
Just get me the details.

810
00:33:52,014 --> 00:33:55,182
I've been thinking, too-- about
your number-cruncher, Harlan.

811
00:33:55,184 --> 00:33:57,017
You think I was
too hard on him.

812
00:33:57,019 --> 00:33:58,685
You will have consultants
of your own one day.

813
00:33:58,687 --> 00:34:01,488
You'll see that they require
management and focus.

814
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:04,124
They are but keys on a keyboard,
and we're the typists.

815
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:06,159
You could've given him
a shoeing for all I care.

816
00:34:06,161 --> 00:34:07,828
No, I'm just saying that

817
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:10,030
some of the stuff he's got
up to, it's quite good.

818
00:34:10,032 --> 00:34:11,698
You should take a look.

819
00:34:13,368 --> 00:34:15,735
You may find a fellow typist.

820
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,076
Hello?

821
00:34:23,078 --> 00:34:25,312
Yeah, I
hear that you and some friends

822
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:27,848
are trying to identify
Mo Shellshocker.

823
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,649
That's right. Who is this?

824
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:32,719
His name is Harlan Emple.

825
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:34,020
You got a pen?

826
00:34:34,022 --> 00:34:36,456
I'll-I'll give you his address.

827
00:34:52,454 --> 00:34:54,020
Harlan.

828
00:34:54,022 --> 00:34:56,356
You can't take a hint, can you?

829
00:34:56,358 --> 00:34:57,657
I got your text messages.

830
00:34:57,659 --> 00:34:58,958
I don't want to see you
right now.

831
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,827
So if you came here
to apologize...

832
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:03,363
Actually, I came here
to spare you an agonizing death.

833
00:35:04,299 --> 00:35:05,832
Can I come in?

834
00:35:05,834 --> 00:35:08,301
I was puzzling earlier

835
00:35:08,303 --> 00:35:12,038
as to why the killer went
to such specific lengths.

836
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,606
What did he want?

837
00:35:13,608 --> 00:35:15,809
And then Watson,
quite by accident,

838
00:35:15,811 --> 00:35:17,410
she made a most
compelling analogy.

839
00:35:17,412 --> 00:35:20,080
She said it was as if he
was on a hunt of his own.

840
00:35:20,082 --> 00:35:22,615
Duh. He was hunting
mathematicians.

841
00:35:22,617 --> 00:35:23,783
No, he wasn't.

842
00:35:23,785 --> 00:35:25,151
He was hunting<i> a</i> mathematician.

843
00:35:25,153 --> 00:35:26,619
One.

844
00:35:26,621 --> 00:35:29,389
A man who had concealed
his identity not only

845
00:35:29,391 --> 00:35:31,191
from the mathematics
community at large,

846
00:35:31,193 --> 00:35:32,859
but also from the FBI.

847
00:35:32,861 --> 00:35:35,395
A “crusader,”
you might call him.

848
00:35:35,397 --> 00:35:36,763
Wait a minute.

849
00:35:36,765 --> 00:35:38,731
Are you saying that
this was all about me?

850
00:35:53,448 --> 00:35:56,449
<i> Unfortunately, emulating</i>
<i>the work of people like me</i>

851
00:35:56,451 --> 00:35:59,018
<i>is not without risks.</i>

852
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,320
Creates enemies.

853
00:36:00,322 --> 00:36:02,889
I knew it was the government.

854
00:36:02,891 --> 00:36:04,424
It was a lottery winner.

855
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,260
Little over a year ago,

856
00:36:07,262 --> 00:36:09,529
you started a series of blogs
where you exposed the flaws

857
00:36:09,531 --> 00:36:11,664
in certain scratch card
lottery games.

858
00:36:11,666 --> 00:36:13,766
Tickets like this one.

859
00:36:13,768 --> 00:36:15,802
I wrote about
baited hook games.

860
00:36:15,804 --> 00:36:17,971
Games where the numbers
are printed on the front.

861
00:36:17,973 --> 00:36:20,707
Scratch off the hidden numbers,
hope for a match.

862
00:36:20,709 --> 00:36:23,309
Only, you proved that with
careful mathematical analysis

863
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:25,512
of the visible numbers,
you could predict

864
00:36:25,514 --> 00:36:28,381
which tickets were winners
80% of the time.

865
00:36:28,383 --> 00:36:29,682
If you had exploited

866
00:36:29,684 --> 00:36:32,085
this flaw,
rather than exposing it,

867
00:36:32,087 --> 00:36:33,520
you could have made millions.

868
00:36:33,522 --> 00:36:36,022
Well... sure.
But that would been cheating.

869
00:36:36,024 --> 00:36:37,157
Right.

870
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:38,825
So imagine
for a moment

871
00:36:38,827 --> 00:36:41,060
that you are a less
honest mathematician.

872
00:36:41,062 --> 00:36:42,495
Right?

873
00:36:42,497 --> 00:36:44,063
You've been taking
advantage of these games

874
00:36:44,065 --> 00:36:47,967
for a couple of years to
amass a small fortune.

875
00:36:47,969 --> 00:36:49,502
And then “Mo"
comes along.

876
00:36:49,504 --> 00:36:51,971
He starts exposing
the broken games.

877
00:36:51,973 --> 00:36:54,340
State lottery commissions
shut them down.

878
00:36:54,342 --> 00:36:56,976
The exploitable
games dry up.

879
00:36:56,978 --> 00:37:00,613
Now, if you were a
psychopathic lottery cheat,

880
00:37:00,615 --> 00:37:02,582
how do you fix that?

881
00:37:02,584 --> 00:37:04,484
You kill Mo.

882
00:37:04,486 --> 00:37:07,253
<i>Unfortunately, Mo is elusive.</i>

883
00:37:07,255 --> 00:37:08,821
<i>Anonymous.</i>

884
00:37:08,823 --> 00:37:11,224
The only thing
he knew about him for sure

885
00:37:11,226 --> 00:37:14,394
was that he could not resist
a puzzle hunt.

886
00:37:14,396 --> 00:37:17,130
Now, if you were smart enough
to identify

887
00:37:17,132 --> 00:37:19,399
and take advantage of
broken lottery games...

888
00:37:19,401 --> 00:37:21,868
Then I'm smart enough
to design a puzzle hunt.

889
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:25,338
This plan was not
without its flaws.

890
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:28,775
Once a competitor
reached the terminal stage,

891
00:37:28,777 --> 00:37:32,745
the killer could not be certain
that he'd trapped Mo, could he?

892
00:37:32,747 --> 00:37:34,480
So he tortured them.

893
00:37:34,482 --> 00:37:37,083
I submit he forced them to
log on to Mo's Web site,

894
00:37:37,085 --> 00:37:39,686
and when they failed...

895
00:37:41,323 --> 00:37:42,755
After two murders,

896
00:37:42,757 --> 00:37:44,290
the game was compromised.

897
00:37:44,292 --> 00:37:46,192
So the killer devises
a Plan “B.”

898
00:37:46,194 --> 00:37:47,460
He tricks

899
00:37:47,462 --> 00:37:49,229
a group of his peers

900
00:37:49,231 --> 00:37:51,097
into helping search
for an alternative means

901
00:37:51,099 --> 00:37:53,032
of identifying Mo.

902
00:37:56,504 --> 00:37:58,438
You're talking about that guy.

903
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,906
The one with the penthouse.

904
00:37:59,908 --> 00:38:02,742
<i>Paul?</i>

905
00:38:02,744 --> 00:38:05,044
Lottery winners
are public record.

906
00:38:05,046 --> 00:38:07,814
So when I searched for
the names of repeat winners

907
00:38:07,816 --> 00:38:09,482
in the dates prior
to your posts...

908
00:38:09,484 --> 00:38:11,317
I can't believe
I drank his water.

909
00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:12,685
I called him.

910
00:38:12,687 --> 00:38:14,654
I identified you as Mo.

911
00:38:14,656 --> 00:38:16,122
And I gave him your address.

912
00:38:16,124 --> 00:38:17,590
You what?!

913
00:38:21,129 --> 00:38:23,062
Drop your weapon!

914
00:38:23,064 --> 00:38:24,597
<i>I did not, however, give him</i>

915
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:25,965
<i>the correct apartment number.</i>

916
00:38:25,967 --> 00:38:28,334
He was arrested
a little over an hour ago.

917
00:38:30,739 --> 00:38:31,871
Tried to call you to
tell you, but, um...

918
00:38:31,873 --> 00:38:33,539
But I was ignoring you.

919
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:35,008
Yes, you were ignoring me.

920
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,209
Look, you know

921
00:38:36,211 --> 00:38:37,377
that I'm still screwed, right?

922
00:38:37,379 --> 00:38:39,279
You told him that I'm Mo.

923
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:42,115
He's gonna tell the police,
they're gonna tell the FBI...

924
00:38:42,117 --> 00:38:43,516
The NYPD is under
the impression

925
00:38:43,518 --> 00:38:45,385
that I lied about
your connection to Mo

926
00:38:45,387 --> 00:38:47,920
in order to draw
Mr. Ettinger out.

927
00:38:47,922 --> 00:38:49,555
As far as the
FBI goes, well,

928
00:38:49,557 --> 00:38:51,958
I've got some associates
who have created a trail

929
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,860
which will
strongly suggest that Mo

930
00:38:53,862 --> 00:38:55,728
is a cyber-terrorist
I became aware of

931
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:58,197
whilst working for, um...

932
00:38:58,199 --> 00:38:59,766
queen and country.

933
00:38:59,768 --> 00:39:02,135
Your secret's
quite safe.

934
00:39:02,137 --> 00:39:03,903
Thanks.

935
00:39:06,508 --> 00:39:09,776
My reasons for preserving you
are entirely selfish, Harlan.

936
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:13,279
You are a tremendous asset.

937
00:39:13,281 --> 00:39:15,815
I have little doubt

938
00:39:15,817 --> 00:39:19,118
I will need your help again
in the future.

939
00:39:26,461 --> 00:39:28,528
Me or him?

940
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:29,996
You.

941
00:39:29,998 --> 00:39:31,798
I have an update on
that real estate flipper.

942
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,433
I thought you might
want to know.

943
00:39:39,274 --> 00:39:41,908
I tracked down the truck rental
receipts to get her name.

944
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,142
Valerie Cork.

945
00:39:43,144 --> 00:39:44,911
She's an art authenticator.

946
00:39:44,913 --> 00:39:46,779
And that crate you saw?

947
00:39:46,781 --> 00:39:48,414
There was
something called

948
00:39:48,416 --> 00:39:50,683
a scanning fluorescence
spectrometry machine inside.

949
00:39:50,685 --> 00:39:52,251
They're used...
To find paintings

950
00:39:52,253 --> 00:39:53,553
underneath other paintings.

951
00:39:53,555 --> 00:39:55,288
So it turns out
that the building

952
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:56,689
Chad Keswick was looking to buy

953
00:39:56,691 --> 00:39:59,025
was leased by the WPA
during the Depression.

954
00:39:59,027 --> 00:40:00,927
They commissioned a
mural for the lobby.

955
00:40:00,929 --> 00:40:03,329
The artist was a
notorious communist,

956
00:40:03,331 --> 00:40:05,365
so when the property passed
into private hands in the '50s,

957
00:40:05,367 --> 00:40:06,999
the new owners
had it painted over.

958
00:40:07,001 --> 00:40:08,735
But it was still there,
under the paint.

959
00:40:08,737 --> 00:40:11,037
A lost work by Diego Rivera.

960
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:13,473
It's worth ten times
the price of the building.

961
00:40:14,676 --> 00:40:17,043
I was hoping to leak
the truth to the<i> Times.</i>

962
00:40:18,113 --> 00:40:20,046
I promised you a cut of my fee.

963
00:40:20,048 --> 00:40:22,148
But I'm pretty sure
the mural's gonna end up

964
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:24,384
in the hands of
a historical trust.

965
00:40:24,386 --> 00:40:26,352
I'd feel obligated
to refund my client,

966
00:40:26,354 --> 00:40:28,388
which means you'd get
a cut of nothing.

967
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:31,457
That works for me.

968
00:40:31,459 --> 00:40:33,493
Okay.

969
00:40:35,463 --> 00:40:37,397
I think you should know

970
00:40:37,399 --> 00:40:39,732
that I am going
to a meeting tonight.

971
00:40:41,803 --> 00:40:45,505
One of those
support groups for...

972
00:40:45,507 --> 00:40:47,340
people like me.

973
00:40:47,342 --> 00:40:49,876
It was, uh, Sherlock's idea.

974
00:40:49,878 --> 00:40:51,644
That's great.

975
00:40:51,646 --> 00:40:53,446
I know you put him up to it.

976
00:40:53,448 --> 00:40:55,381
We talked.

977
00:40:57,552 --> 00:41:00,219
When he first approached me
in London,

978
00:41:00,221 --> 00:41:03,556
I was...

979
00:41:03,558 --> 00:41:05,558
in a bad way.

980
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,227
And I had been for a while.

981
00:41:08,229 --> 00:41:11,130
But then,
when he talked about

982
00:41:11,132 --> 00:41:12,365
the work that he did,

983
00:41:12,367 --> 00:41:16,035
about the things
that he saw in me...

984
00:41:18,406 --> 00:41:19,739
I want it.

985
00:41:19,741 --> 00:41:21,874
I want every bit
of what's he offered me,

986
00:41:21,876 --> 00:41:23,843
of what he offered you, but...

987
00:41:23,845 --> 00:41:26,212
if I've learned one thing
over the last few weeks,

988
00:41:26,214 --> 00:41:28,047
it's that he can't pull it off.

989
00:41:28,049 --> 00:41:29,682
Not by himself, anyway.

990
00:41:31,586 --> 00:41:34,153
And if I'm gonna get
what I want,

991
00:41:34,155 --> 00:41:37,690
then I'm going to need
your help, too.

992
00:41:40,361 --> 00:41:42,829
I still think
the meetings are bollocks,

993
00:41:42,831 --> 00:41:44,931
but you say they're important.

994
00:41:44,933 --> 00:41:47,967
They matter to you, so...

995
00:41:47,969 --> 00:41:49,735
What do you say, Watson?

996
00:41:49,737 --> 00:41:52,071
Will you help me?

997
00:41:56,277 --> 00:41:58,244
I don't know how it happened.

998
00:41:58,246 --> 00:42:01,547
It just... hit me.

999
00:42:01,549 --> 00:42:03,983
Like a truck, out of nowhere.

1000
00:42:04,853 --> 00:42:07,753
Work is good.

1001
00:42:07,755 --> 00:42:09,755
I have friends.

1002
00:42:09,757 --> 00:42:13,092
I'm in a
relationship.

1003
00:42:13,094 --> 00:42:16,896
Somewhere along
the way, somehow,

1004
00:42:16,898 --> 00:42:19,732
I stopped being a victim

1005
00:42:19,734 --> 00:42:22,602
and became a survivor.

1006
00:42:22,604 --> 00:42:25,705
So, I guess all I'm saying is,
there's hope.

1007
00:42:26,357 --> 00:42:31,686
Do the work. Love yourself.
There's hope.

why he isn't wearing a shirt.

victim of a horrific crime.

00:00:22,712 --> 00:00:24,646
<i>After you left last night,</i>

13
00:00:24,648 --> 00:00:26,848
Sherlock gave me an envelope.

14
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,249
Sherlock keeps saying

15
00:00:28,251 --> 00:00:30,385
that I need to get
a better sense of you,

16
00:00:30,387 --> 00:00:33,021
and maybe that will give you
a better sense of me.

17
00:00:42,065 --> 00:00:43,065
It's open.

18
00:00:47,637 --> 00:00:49,003
It's nothing.

19
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:50,872
It's Sherlock and
one of his experts.

20
00:00:50,874 --> 00:00:52,006
Which one?

21
00:00:52,008 --> 00:00:53,241
Phillip something.

22
00:00:53,243 --> 00:00:54,575
Must be new.

23
00:00:54,577 --> 00:00:57,445
He's a knife-thrower.

24
00:00:57,447 --> 00:00:58,913
Why does Sherlock have
a knife-thrower?

25
00:00:58,915 --> 00:01:00,748
He got bored the other day,

26
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,185
started looking into this, uh,
circus accident from the '30s.

27
00:01:04,187 --> 00:01:07,922
The Great Galardo perforated one
of his assistants during an act,

28
00:01:07,924 --> 00:01:09,924
except Sherlock thinks
the blade was thrown

29
00:01:09,926 --> 00:01:11,492
by somebody in the stands,
not Galardo.

30
00:01:11,494 --> 00:01:15,096
Phillip, as far as I
can tell, disagrees.

31
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:18,900
It can't be done, okay?

32
00:01:18,902 --> 00:01:19,934
It was done.

33
00:01:19,936 --> 00:01:21,335
You're wrong.

34
00:01:21,337 --> 00:01:23,538
Nobody can chuck
a knife that far.

35
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,239
What's this?

36
00:01:25,241 --> 00:01:26,207
You're...

37
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:27,209
Not here.

38
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,509
I'm not here.

39
00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:29,711
Remember that, okay?

40
00:01:29,713 --> 00:01:31,279
Oh, yes. Heaven
forfend your work

41
00:01:31,281 --> 00:01:33,247
with me should endanger
your precious day job.

42
00:01:33,249 --> 00:01:35,116
You throw knives?

43
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,252
You know, it was supposed
to be just you here.

44
00:01:38,254 --> 00:01:41,355
Phillip is arguably the greatest
knife-thrower in the world.

45
00:01:41,357 --> 00:01:42,790
Has been for decades.

46
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:43,925
Only, there's little money

47
00:01:43,927 --> 00:01:45,193
to be made
in the impalement arts.

48
00:01:45,195 --> 00:01:46,494
So, as a youth, he turned

49
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,563
to what you Americans
term “football”"

50
00:01:48,565 --> 00:01:50,131
Is this a joke?

51
00:01:53,837 --> 00:01:55,002
Phillip, head
and heart.

52
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:56,904
Come on.
Head and heart.

53
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:06,814
Can I go?

54
00:02:06,816 --> 00:02:09,484
Yeah.

55
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,489
15 years he spent throwing
that misshapen ball around.

56
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:16,057
15 years.

57
00:02:16,059 --> 00:02:18,259
When I think of the acclaim
he could have brought

58
00:02:18,261 --> 00:02:20,828
to competitive blade slinging.

59
00:02:27,237 --> 00:02:29,036
You're following me,
Watson.

60
00:02:29,038 --> 00:02:30,338
I don't like it.

61
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,740
I want you to help
me with something.

62
00:02:32,742 --> 00:02:33,908
This is Chad Keswick.

63
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,976
He buys distressed
buildings,

64
00:02:34,978 --> 00:02:36,210
paints, spackles,

65
00:02:36,212 --> 00:02:37,645
and then flips them
for quick money.

66
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:39,180
Who'd he kill?
No one.

67
00:02:39,182 --> 00:02:41,315
I was hired by one of
his rivals to find out

68
00:02:41,317 --> 00:02:43,017
why he's been circling
this old office building

69
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:44,218
in Jamaica, Queens.

70
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,586
She wants to know
why he thinks

71
00:02:45,588 --> 00:02:47,355
the building is
a good investment.

72
00:02:47,357 --> 00:02:49,590
Is there a crime in there,
something worth investigating?

73
00:02:49,592 --> 00:02:50,925
Well, I've been
shadowing Keswick,

74
00:02:50,927 --> 00:02:52,593
but yesterday I think
he noticed me.

75
00:02:52,595 --> 00:02:54,595
I want to switch
up the tail.

76
00:02:54,597 --> 00:02:57,231
You followed me for over
a week before I noticed you.

77
00:02:57,233 --> 00:02:59,033
Help me out, and I'll
cut you in on my fee.

78
00:02:59,035 --> 00:03:02,003
I don't work for you,
I work for Sherlock.

79
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:03,437
I worked for him, too.

80
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,773
And, in my experience,
he was always supportive

81
00:03:05,775 --> 00:03:07,942
of taking on work
outside the partnership.

82
00:03:07,944 --> 00:03:10,912
Sorry, it's not my cup of tea.

83
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:33,034
Hello, Portal Ten.

84
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,247
I'm here, Belphegor.

85
00:03:46,249 --> 00:03:49,784
So where is the next clue?

Yeah, you called it
a puzzle hunt.

91
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,491
Belphegor's Prime.

92
00:04:50,761 --> 00:04:53,262
Think Cicada 3301
or Octorine's Challenge.

93
00:04:54,365 --> 00:04:55,631
They're math games.

94
00:04:55,633 --> 00:04:56,865
Math-- maybe you've heard of it.

95
00:04:56,867 --> 00:04:58,333
I've got some math for you.

96
00:04:58,335 --> 00:05:00,335
One dead guy
plus one live guy

97
00:05:00,337 --> 00:05:02,104
found in the same
deserted factory.

98
00:05:02,106 --> 00:05:06,108
I was not “found” there;
I am the one who called 911.

99
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,310
I was waiting there
for the police.

100
00:05:08,312 --> 00:05:09,745
Mr. Emple,

101
00:05:09,747 --> 00:05:11,613
we're just trying
to do our jobs, all right?

102
00:05:11,615 --> 00:05:13,048
First officers
on the scene described you

103
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,516
as “extremely agitated.”

104
00:05:14,518 --> 00:05:15,984
Well, of course
I was agitated.

105
00:05:15,986 --> 00:05:18,754
I had just found
a dead guy in mothballs!

106
00:05:18,756 --> 00:05:21,790
And did I mention that I have
not slept in almost two days?

107
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:23,358
Because of the math game.

108
00:05:24,762 --> 00:05:26,195
Can I borrow those?

109
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:31,100
This...

110
00:05:31,102 --> 00:05:33,302
is Belphegor's Prime, okay?

111
00:05:33,304 --> 00:05:35,304
It's a numeric palindrome.

112
00:05:35,306 --> 00:05:40,776
It's 666 bookended by 13 zeroes
and then bracketed with ones.

113
00:05:40,778 --> 00:05:43,846
Named for the demon Belphegor
who was a prince of hell.

114
00:05:43,848 --> 00:05:46,448
The first clue for the hunt
started making the rounds

115
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,883
a few months ago.

116
00:05:47,885 --> 00:05:49,651
It was a JPEG with two numbers
hidden in it.

117
00:05:49,653 --> 00:05:51,453
You divide those numbers
by Belphegor's Prime,

118
00:05:51,455 --> 00:05:54,890
and you get the GPS coordinates
for a restroom at the Bronx Zoo.

119
00:05:54,892 --> 00:05:56,959
You go to the restroom,
you find a phone number.

120
00:05:56,961 --> 00:05:58,927
You send a text to the number,
you get the next clue.

121
00:05:58,929 --> 00:05:59,962
Which is another math problem.

122
00:05:59,964 --> 00:06:00,929
Exactly.

123
00:06:00,931 --> 00:06:02,397
Only, this one is harder.

124
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,099
And that's how it works.

125
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:05,934
You know, but for
each one that you solve,

126
00:06:05,936 --> 00:06:08,103
you get a new set
of GPS coordinates.

127
00:06:08,105 --> 00:06:11,473
And that means that you've
completed a stage, or a portal.

128
00:06:11,475 --> 00:06:13,509
And last night,
I was on Portal Ten.

129
00:06:13,511 --> 00:06:15,711
And...

130
00:06:17,014 --> 00:06:18,313
You know what?

131
00:06:18,315 --> 00:06:20,015
I want to talk
to Sherlock and Joan.

132
00:06:20,017 --> 00:06:21,917
Look, Mr. Emple...
No, I'm sorry.

133
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,019
I told the police down
at the factory that I know them.

134
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:25,287
Isn't that the whole reason

135
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:26,922
that I was brought here
to this squad?

136
00:06:26,924 --> 00:06:30,392
I-I am not saying another word
until they are here.

137
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:35,264
Harlan Emple is
indeed an acquaintance.

138
00:06:35,266 --> 00:06:37,733
He is, in point of fact,
one of my “irregulars.”

139
00:06:37,735 --> 00:06:38,801
One of your what?

140
00:06:38,803 --> 00:06:40,302
Irregulars.

141
00:06:40,304 --> 00:06:41,770
I'm your consultant, Captain;
they are mine.

142
00:06:41,772 --> 00:06:43,572
They're a handful
of experts I turn to

143
00:06:43,574 --> 00:06:46,108
when I encounter problems which
are beyond my pool of knowledge.

144
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,810
Harlan is
a brilliant mathematician.

145
00:06:47,812 --> 00:06:49,778
And on the handful of occasions
I have tackled a case

146
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,046
which pertained
to mathematics...

147
00:06:51,048 --> 00:06:53,182
He helped you out.
Well, the good news

148
00:06:53,184 --> 00:06:56,018
for him is the preliminary
autopsy report just came in

149
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,252
before you got here.

150
00:06:57,254 --> 00:06:59,021
And the M.E. puts
the time of death

151
00:06:59,023 --> 00:07:00,989
between 4:00 and
6:00 p.m. last night.

152
00:07:00,991 --> 00:07:02,124
Mr. Emple was teaching

153
00:07:02,126 --> 00:07:03,358
a class at Columbia.

154
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,394
So the victim is
yet to be identified?

155
00:07:05,396 --> 00:07:07,663
No I.D., no phone.

156
00:07:07,665 --> 00:07:09,865
First detective on the scene
liked it for a mob hit,

157
00:07:09,867 --> 00:07:11,500
so while we're
running the prints,

158
00:07:11,502 --> 00:07:13,602
he's showing the vic's
face around OCID.

159
00:07:13,604 --> 00:07:16,839
Marcus here was about to walk
the scene with Mr. Emple.

160
00:07:16,841 --> 00:07:18,774
You're here now;
you might as well tag along.

161
00:07:18,776 --> 00:07:21,009
Actually, Captain,
I'm quite busy today.

162
00:07:21,011 --> 00:07:22,978
This is a John Doe,
and we got nothing.

163
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,247
And, like you just said,
you're my consultant.

164
00:07:25,249 --> 00:07:26,748
So, go consult.

165
00:07:29,787 --> 00:07:30,986
Watson.

166
00:07:30,988 --> 00:07:32,588
Um, he's your friend.

167
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,523
Actually, Kitty is
otherwise engaged,

168
00:07:34,525 --> 00:07:37,426
and he did actually help both
of us with a case last year.

169
00:07:37,428 --> 00:07:38,493
Did he not?

170
00:07:40,865 --> 00:07:44,099
Have I told you
how good it is to see you?

171
00:07:44,101 --> 00:07:45,367
Yes, you have.
Three times.

172
00:07:45,369 --> 00:07:46,468
Well, it is.

173
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,636
Hey, lousy circumstances.

174
00:07:47,638 --> 00:07:49,371
But, uh, hey...

175
00:07:49,373 --> 00:07:51,740
I heard from your boss that you
just, uh, got back from London.

176
00:07:51,742 --> 00:07:53,308
Were you working
a case or...?

177
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,576
No, I moved back there.

178
00:07:54,578 --> 00:07:55,677
You mean<i> moved,</i> moved?

179
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:56,845
Is there another
definition?

180
00:07:56,847 --> 00:07:58,513
I was there for
eight months,

181
00:07:58,515 --> 00:08:00,883
and had a change of heart
and returned to New York.

182
00:08:00,885 --> 00:08:02,517
So, you moved to London,
and you didn't, uh...

183
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,086
You know what?
Doesn't even matter.

184
00:08:04,088 --> 00:08:05,387
The point is you're back!

185
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:07,389
Mr. Emple.
Uh, duty calls.

186
00:08:07,391 --> 00:08:09,024
Yeah.

187
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:18,634
It's interesting.

188
00:08:18,636 --> 00:08:20,068
Mothballs are interesting?

189
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,070
They were taken from
that cabinet over there.

190
00:08:22,072 --> 00:08:25,941
Obviously, to cover the smell
of John Doe's decay.

191
00:08:25,943 --> 00:08:28,043
The killer didn't
bring them with him.

192
00:08:28,045 --> 00:08:31,179
Perhaps leaving the body here
was not part of his plan, hmm?

193
00:08:32,983 --> 00:08:36,018
Doe was shot in the foot
first and then the knee.

194
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,453
Either those were
two really bad misses or...

195
00:08:38,455 --> 00:08:41,256
Or the killer was torturing him.

196
00:08:41,258 --> 00:08:43,892
This doesn't seem like anything
you can't handle on your own.

197
00:08:43,894 --> 00:08:45,994
So you want to tell me why you
really asked me to come here?

198
00:08:45,996 --> 00:08:48,363
“This doesn't seem like anything
you can't handle on your own.”

199
00:08:48,365 --> 00:08:49,765
That's funny.

200
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:51,566
That's exactly what
I would have said

201
00:08:51,568 --> 00:08:53,602
had I been present when you
asked Kitty for her assistance

202
00:08:53,604 --> 00:08:54,937
with your tawdry side job.

203
00:08:54,939 --> 00:08:57,372
“Tawdry”?
I wanted you to know I approve.

204
00:08:57,374 --> 00:08:59,007
Of what?

205
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:01,376
Your agenda
with regards to Kitty.

206
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:03,078
Several days ago,
I gave you her file.

207
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,913
And then you show up at
the brownstone yesterday,

208
00:09:04,915 --> 00:09:06,515
and you invite her
into an investigation.

209
00:09:06,517 --> 00:09:08,183
Coincidence? No, I think not.

210
00:09:08,185 --> 00:09:11,320
You feel for her.
And now you wish to engage.

211
00:09:11,322 --> 00:09:13,956
It's not an outcome
I would have predicted, no.

212
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,458
But it is one
I approve of, yeah.

213
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,193
She could learn
a great deal from you,

214
00:09:18,195 --> 00:09:20,228
especially with regards
to how to get the most

215
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,864
from my tutelage.

216
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:25,734
So, I've already dispatched her
to, uh, follow your Mr. Keswick.

217
00:09:25,736 --> 00:09:27,836
But that's not
what I actually...

218
00:09:27,838 --> 00:09:29,404
Harlan!

219
00:09:30,741 --> 00:09:33,075
You came here to retrieve
a phone number, did you not?

220
00:09:33,077 --> 00:09:34,609
You would send a text,
and then receive

221
00:09:34,611 --> 00:09:36,845
the next clue in the game
that you were playing.

222
00:09:36,847 --> 00:09:38,747
Yeah, but I didn't find it.

223
00:09:38,749 --> 00:09:40,048
Not that I kept looking

224
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,250
after the dead guy
fell out of the locker.

225
00:09:42,252 --> 00:09:44,052
Yeah, CSU didn't find
any number either.

226
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:46,154
Probably because
it's under that paint.

227
00:09:46,156 --> 00:09:48,190
It's fresh.

228
00:09:48,192 --> 00:09:49,891
Applied in the last

229
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:52,694
24 hours.

230
00:09:52,696 --> 00:09:54,696
Right after John Doe's murder,
I'd wager.

231
00:09:54,698 --> 00:09:57,099
You don't think
this was a mob hit?

232
00:09:57,101 --> 00:09:59,101
Doe and the killer were
playing the game, too.

233
00:09:59,103 --> 00:10:01,203
The killer shot Doe and
then covered up the number

234
00:10:01,205 --> 00:10:02,704
so no one else could use it.

235
00:10:02,706 --> 00:10:04,806
What's the prize
in your little contest?

236
00:10:04,808 --> 00:10:07,576
Well, I'm doing it
mostly for the math.

237
00:10:07,578 --> 00:10:11,480
But, uh, $1,707,071.

238
00:10:11,482 --> 00:10:13,882
It's another
palindromic prime.

239
00:10:13,884 --> 00:10:17,152
Did I not mention the
money at the station?

240
00:10:17,154 --> 00:10:18,587
Who the hell can afford

241
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:20,655
that kind of payout
for a puzzle hunt?

242
00:10:20,657 --> 00:10:22,124
Well, most people
think it's CAML.

243
00:10:22,126 --> 00:10:24,593
The Center for Applied
Mathematics and Logic.

244
00:10:24,595 --> 00:10:26,094
It's located
in Ramapo...

245
00:10:26,096 --> 00:10:27,729
Wait, most people
“think” it's them?

246
00:10:27,731 --> 00:10:29,331
Well, hunts like these,

247
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,266
the organizers are
almost always anonymous.

248
00:10:31,268 --> 00:10:32,401
It's S.O.P.

249
00:10:32,403 --> 00:10:34,302
What about the
contestants?

250
00:10:34,304 --> 00:10:37,005
Is anonymity
also S.O.P.?

251
00:10:37,007 --> 00:10:39,207
For the most part, yeah.

252
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:43,078
But, guys, math peeps
are my peeps, okay?

253
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,314
It's, uh, like
a community, sort of.

254
00:10:46,316 --> 00:10:48,984
I can think of ten
or 12 other people

255
00:10:48,986 --> 00:10:50,018
who were probably competing.

256
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,186
Would that help?

257
00:10:53,157 --> 00:10:55,223
No.

258
00:10:55,225 --> 00:10:58,026
I'm sorry, I don't know him.

259
00:10:58,028 --> 00:11:00,862
But you admit you were
competing in Belphegor's Prime.

260
00:11:00,864 --> 00:11:02,197
I do.

261
00:11:04,835 --> 00:11:05,934
Pepe!

262
00:11:08,172 --> 00:11:10,439
Sorry. He doesn't
like strangers.

263
00:11:12,109 --> 00:11:14,443
Give him one of these.

264
00:11:14,445 --> 00:11:16,111
Get on his good side.

265
00:11:24,288 --> 00:11:26,354
What are you doing?

266
00:11:28,225 --> 00:11:30,725
I'm just verifying that
you've been lying to us.

267
00:11:30,727 --> 00:11:33,895
You did know the
dead man, did you not?

268
00:11:33,897 --> 00:11:36,998
I reviewed his personal
effects at the morgue earlier.

269
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,034
The coroner reported finding
crumbs in one of his pockets.

270
00:11:39,036 --> 00:11:40,036
I tasted one.

271
00:11:40,037 --> 00:11:41,269
Why would you...?

272
00:11:41,271 --> 00:11:42,771
At first, I thought
they were from

273
00:11:42,773 --> 00:11:44,439
a particularly rancid
brand of cheese,

274
00:11:44,441 --> 00:11:47,609
but, no... they're from
one of Pepe's treats.

275
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:49,277
Homemade?

276
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,481
Harlan was able to give us
the names of nine other people

277
00:11:52,483 --> 00:11:54,149
he believed to be
other competitors.

278
00:11:54,151 --> 00:11:55,984
Our colleagues are
investigating them as we speak,

279
00:11:55,986 --> 00:11:57,919
but I'll quite happily
recommend that the NYPD

280
00:11:57,921 --> 00:12:00,222
focus its attention
entirely on you.

281
00:12:04,128 --> 00:12:06,428
His name was Ike Walaczek.

282
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,231
In another lifetime,
he was my boyfriend.

283
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:10,866
And what of
this lifetime?

284
00:12:10,868 --> 00:12:12,701
We were working together.

285
00:12:12,703 --> 00:12:14,769
On Belphegor's.
What?!

286
00:12:14,771 --> 00:12:16,705
He was a numerical analyst
at the Tory Foundation.

287
00:12:16,707 --> 00:12:17,873
I work mostly in combinatorics.

288
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,307
I thought we would make
a good team.

289
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:20,742
But there aren't
supposed to be teams.

290
00:12:20,744 --> 00:12:22,711
Not in a puzzle hunt.
It's bad form.

291
00:12:22,713 --> 00:12:23,713
Harlan...

292
00:12:23,714 --> 00:12:25,514
I'm just saying...

293
00:12:25,516 --> 00:12:27,315
My husband
wouldn't understand,

294
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:30,385
so I decided I wouldn't tell him
until after we won the money.

295
00:12:30,387 --> 00:12:33,121
A team-- so that's how
you got there before me.

296
00:12:33,123 --> 00:12:34,489
I wasn't there.

297
00:12:34,491 --> 00:12:36,258
Tom and I were out of town
until this morning.

298
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,126
His cousin
was getting married in Hawaii.

299
00:12:38,128 --> 00:12:40,662
That's why Ike went
to the coordinates by himself.

300
00:12:40,664 --> 00:12:42,097
Because I couldn't.

301
00:12:44,268 --> 00:12:46,601
These are pictures I took.

302
00:12:46,603 --> 00:12:49,337
Check the dates.

303
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:51,506
You gave the police
nine other names?

304
00:12:51,508 --> 00:12:53,408
People you thought
were competing?

305
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,776
I've got 16.

306
00:12:54,778 --> 00:12:56,311
And I know they were competing.

307
00:12:58,448 --> 00:13:01,249
He talked to her
outside the Jamaica property

308
00:13:01,251 --> 00:13:05,720
for about 20 minutes,
and then this truck rolled up.

309
00:13:05,722 --> 00:13:07,822
Any idea what's
inside the crate?

310
00:13:07,824 --> 00:13:09,024
Nope.

311
00:13:09,026 --> 00:13:10,392
I can't identify
the woman either.

312
00:13:10,394 --> 00:13:12,260
Everything about her
said money though.

313
00:13:12,262 --> 00:13:15,363
She, Keswick
and the mystery box

314
00:13:15,365 --> 00:13:17,732
stayed inside the building
for about three hours,

315
00:13:17,734 --> 00:13:20,001
and then off they went.

316
00:13:20,904 --> 00:13:22,170
Good.

317
00:13:22,172 --> 00:13:23,872
Okay.

318
00:13:23,874 --> 00:13:26,074
You know where
to send the check.

319
00:13:26,076 --> 00:13:30,145
You haven't asked me about
the file Sherlock gave me.

320
00:13:30,147 --> 00:13:32,080
Why would I?

321
00:13:32,082 --> 00:13:36,184
You said it would give me
a better sense of you-- it did.

322
00:13:37,588 --> 00:13:40,155
That's why you asked
for my help.

323
00:13:40,157 --> 00:13:41,990
Because you felt sorry for me.

324
00:13:41,992 --> 00:13:44,226
No.

325
00:13:44,228 --> 00:13:46,194
You just don't seem interested
in anything

326
00:13:46,196 --> 00:13:48,063
outside of becoming
a detective.

327
00:13:48,065 --> 00:13:50,999
There she is.

328
00:13:51,001 --> 00:13:53,301
The old counselor.

329
00:13:53,303 --> 00:13:55,637
Who used to hold
Sherlock's hand.

330
00:13:57,608 --> 00:13:59,741
Everything that you read,

331
00:13:59,743 --> 00:14:02,510
everything that happened to me,
that's all it is.

332
00:14:02,512 --> 00:14:04,646
It's just something
that happened.

333
00:14:04,648 --> 00:14:08,116
And it's all
in the past now.

334
00:14:08,118 --> 00:14:10,685
So let's just
leave it there, shall we?

335
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:24,667
Hello.

336
00:14:24,668 --> 00:14:26,001
You've had sex.

337
00:14:26,003 --> 00:14:27,202
Excuse me?

338
00:14:27,204 --> 00:14:28,503
I can hear it
in your voice.

339
00:14:28,505 --> 00:14:29,771
You've joined paunches.

340
00:14:29,773 --> 00:14:30,972
Good for you, Watson.

341
00:14:30,974 --> 00:14:32,807
As you know, I think
the act of love

342
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:34,676
can be quite conducive to...
What do you want?

343
00:14:34,678 --> 00:14:36,911
Merely to apprise you
of a new development

344
00:14:36,913 --> 00:14:38,280
in the murder of
Ike Walaczek.

345
00:14:38,282 --> 00:14:40,115
As I informed
you yesterday,

346
00:14:40,117 --> 00:14:42,284
Harlan and I were given
a new list of competitors.

347
00:14:42,286 --> 00:14:45,320
One name leapt out:
Byron Lowenthal.

348
00:14:45,322 --> 00:14:48,156
He's a statistician at the
Public Utilities Commission

349
00:14:48,158 --> 00:14:50,425
and a diagnosed
paranoid schizophrenic.

350
00:14:50,427 --> 00:14:52,160
He's been hospitalized
for becoming violent

351
00:14:52,162 --> 00:14:53,728
on no fewer
than three occasions.

352
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,964
Certainly sounds like
it could be our guy.

353
00:14:55,966 --> 00:14:59,367
Unfortunately, Mr. Lowenthal had
another break earlier this year.

354
00:14:59,369 --> 00:15:02,137
He's been staying in
a transient hotel ever since.

355
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:04,239
Detective Bell and I
are going to speak with him.

356
00:15:04,241 --> 00:15:05,307
You want me to meet you?

357
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:06,875
Oh, no, we're already here.

358
00:15:06,877 --> 00:15:08,410
Anyway, now that I know
that you've enjoyed coitus

359
00:15:08,412 --> 00:15:09,778
and could enjoy more
in the near future...

360
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,846
When you're done,
we need to talk.

361
00:15:14,718 --> 00:15:16,818
Byron Lowenthal,
you in there?

362
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,053
Who is it?

363
00:15:18,055 --> 00:15:19,754
It's Detective Bell, NYPD.

364
00:15:19,756 --> 00:15:22,257
My colleague and I would like
to ask you some questions.

365
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:24,592
Let me
get some pants on.

366
00:15:37,341 --> 00:15:40,008
S-Sorry, I just... I, um...

367
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,310
I-I thought I heard
Mr. Lowenthal retr...

368
00:16:19,154 --> 00:16:21,267
You guys got lucky.

369
00:16:21,268 --> 00:16:22,868
Well, luck had little
to do with it, actually.

370
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,536
I... I heard Mr. Lowenthal

371
00:16:24,538 --> 00:16:27,039
pulling a heavy object off
a shelf, placing it on his bed,

372
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,041
and the sound of
the zipper indicated

373
00:16:29,043 --> 00:16:30,976
that it was
a large gun case.

374
00:16:30,978 --> 00:16:33,579
Looks like he was sane enough
to do math, but not much else.

375
00:16:33,581 --> 00:16:34,747
Plus, he was
pretty hopped up.

376
00:16:34,749 --> 00:16:36,448
Caffeine pills,
energy drinks,

377
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,251
pretty much every legal
stimulant you can buy.

378
00:16:39,253 --> 00:16:40,853
Plus a few illegal ones.

379
00:16:40,855 --> 00:16:42,821
Hmm. Obviously, he was
keeping himself awake

380
00:16:42,823 --> 00:16:44,490
so he could work on
Belphegor's.

381
00:16:44,492 --> 00:16:47,392
This... is obvious to you?

382
00:16:47,394 --> 00:16:48,961
I confess the maths
are beyond me,

383
00:16:48,963 --> 00:16:51,130
but I took the liberty of
sending pictures of what

384
00:16:51,132 --> 00:16:52,865
appear to be Mr. Lowenthal's
most recent scribbles

385
00:16:52,867 --> 00:16:54,166
to Harlan Emple,
and he's confirmed

386
00:16:54,168 --> 00:16:55,667
they are part of the contest.

387
00:16:55,669 --> 00:16:56,969
With your permission,
I'd like copies of these

388
00:16:56,971 --> 00:16:58,837
sent to my home
so he can review them.

389
00:16:58,839 --> 00:16:59,972
What for?

390
00:16:59,974 --> 00:17:01,073
If Byron Lowenthal

391
00:17:01,075 --> 00:17:02,441
did kill Ike Walaczek,

392
00:17:02,443 --> 00:17:04,109
then he used
and obscured a phone number,

393
00:17:04,111 --> 00:17:05,878
which would have yielded
the next problem.

394
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,379
That problem's solution

395
00:17:07,381 --> 00:17:08,714
would be GPS coordinates.

396
00:17:08,716 --> 00:17:10,415
If he's recorded them
in his books...

397
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:12,551
Your pal will be able to tell us
where he's headed next.

398
00:17:12,553 --> 00:17:14,853
I'll get our guys to give you

399
00:17:14,855 --> 00:17:16,388
whatever you need.

400
00:17:17,258 --> 00:17:18,991
Scans are still coming through,

401
00:17:18,993 --> 00:17:21,260
but I've put what we've got
so far up on the wall.

402
00:17:21,262 --> 00:17:23,262
Sherlock said that
you prefer it that way.

403
00:17:23,264 --> 00:17:25,030
Picked it up from him,
actually.

404
00:17:25,032 --> 00:17:28,600
Makes me feel like I'm really
inside of the problem.

405
00:17:30,704 --> 00:17:33,372
I'll, uh, let you know
if I need anything.

406
00:17:34,275 --> 00:17:35,974
Oh, I work without a shirt.

407
00:17:35,976 --> 00:17:38,911
Sometimes makes me feel
closer to the numbers.

408
00:17:38,913 --> 00:17:42,147
You'll need to, uh,
check the printer in the study

409
00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:43,615
for more pages.

410
00:17:43,617 --> 00:17:45,417
Uh, this is nice,
you know?

411
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:47,452
Meeting another member
of the team.

412
00:17:47,454 --> 00:17:48,654
You know, Team Sherlock.

413
00:17:48,656 --> 00:17:50,656
You help him, I help him...

414
00:17:51,926 --> 00:17:53,559
Obviously, you haven't
tackled a case

415
00:17:53,561 --> 00:17:55,093
with high-order math since
you started working with him,

416
00:17:55,095 --> 00:17:57,729
or we would've...

417
00:17:57,731 --> 00:17:59,031
What?

418
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:00,232
What?

419
00:18:00,234 --> 00:18:01,834
Wait...

420
00:18:01,836 --> 00:18:04,002
have you worked a case
with high-order math?

421
00:18:04,805 --> 00:18:06,238
You have, haven't you?

422
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,840
Does it matter?

423
00:18:07,842 --> 00:18:09,842
Of course it...

424
00:18:09,844 --> 00:18:11,443
Oh, my God.

425
00:18:11,445 --> 00:18:13,278
Did he fire me?

426
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,980
All I know
is that back in London,

427
00:18:14,982 --> 00:18:16,982
we worked a case that involved
Fibonacci spirals...

428
00:18:16,984 --> 00:18:18,483
He fired me.

429
00:18:18,485 --> 00:18:21,386
...and he called some woman
named Indira Patel.

430
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,856
She's at Berkeley.

431
00:18:23,858 --> 00:18:25,624
I'm three time zones closer!

432
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:27,125
You're here now.

433
00:18:27,127 --> 00:18:29,428
Sure, because I found
a dead body.

434
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,531
I have to go; I have to run
some errands for Sherlock.

435
00:18:35,936 --> 00:18:37,903
I-I don't know
what was in the crate,

436
00:18:37,905 --> 00:18:39,271
but the stenciling on
the side indicates

437
00:18:39,273 --> 00:18:40,772
it came from one of
the SUNY schools.

438
00:18:40,774 --> 00:18:42,908
I put another detective
on Keswick...

439
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:45,177
Don't kill me, I had to
use your razor to shave.

440
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:47,179
I...

441
00:18:47,181 --> 00:18:49,147
You must be Andrew.

442
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:50,515
Sherlock Holmes.

443
00:18:50,517 --> 00:18:52,551
Sorry.

444
00:18:52,553 --> 00:18:55,487
Joan said you were coming;
I... I forgot.

445
00:18:55,489 --> 00:18:57,122
It's not how
I wanted to meet you.

446
00:18:57,124 --> 00:18:58,891
She said you can tell
a lot about people

447
00:18:58,893 --> 00:19:00,192
just by looking at them.

448
00:19:00,194 --> 00:19:02,261
I swear, I...
usually wear pants.

449
00:19:02,263 --> 00:19:03,729
Well, in my experience,
most people

450
00:19:03,731 --> 00:19:05,264
need only be concerned
I won't notice

451
00:19:05,266 --> 00:19:06,498
anything worth remarking upon.

452
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:10,535
Watson seems adequately sexed.

453
00:19:11,939 --> 00:19:13,672
Hey.

454
00:19:13,674 --> 00:19:15,674
I was just introducing myself.

455
00:19:17,945 --> 00:19:20,379
I've got that thing.
I'll see you tonight.

456
00:19:20,381 --> 00:19:21,580
Okay.

457
00:19:27,855 --> 00:19:30,188
Your home, Watson...

458
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,823
it's utterly pleasant.

459
00:19:31,825 --> 00:19:33,692
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

460
00:19:33,694 --> 00:19:35,394
When you told me
you wanted a life of your own,

461
00:19:35,396 --> 00:19:36,595
I didn't realize
that you meant you wanted

462
00:19:36,597 --> 00:19:38,030
the same life everyone else has.

463
00:19:38,032 --> 00:19:39,464
But at any rate,
none of my business, is it?

464
00:19:39,466 --> 00:19:41,233
It's not.
And I didn't ask you here

465
00:19:41,235 --> 00:19:42,634
to talk about my apartment.

466
00:19:42,636 --> 00:19:44,970
No, you asked me here
to discuss Kitty.

467
00:19:44,972 --> 00:19:46,471
If she were not
the topic of conversation,

468
00:19:46,473 --> 00:19:48,941
then you wouldn't have
invited me to your home,

469
00:19:48,943 --> 00:19:50,776
where there's no chance
she'll be present.

470
00:19:52,346 --> 00:19:53,946
She disappointed you
in some way.

471
00:19:53,948 --> 00:19:55,247
Skills not up to snuff?

472
00:19:55,249 --> 00:19:57,316
Please remember
she is a novice.

473
00:19:57,318 --> 00:19:58,850
Actually, she did a great job.

474
00:19:58,852 --> 00:20:00,285
But I have some concerns.

475
00:20:00,287 --> 00:20:01,954
I thought we could
talk about them.

476
00:20:03,757 --> 00:20:04,923
You think that
Kitty needs help

477
00:20:04,925 --> 00:20:06,091
above and beyond
my mentorship.

478
00:20:06,093 --> 00:20:07,392
You read the same
file I did.

479
00:20:07,394 --> 00:20:08,894
She's a rape victim.

480
00:20:08,896 --> 00:20:11,296
She was kept and tortured.

481
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,899
Mm.

482
00:20:16,136 --> 00:20:19,171
You know me, so surely you know

483
00:20:19,173 --> 00:20:22,874
I've broached the subject of
a support group meeting before.

484
00:20:22,876 --> 00:20:25,010
Even offered
to pay for therapy.

485
00:20:25,012 --> 00:20:26,812
She's not interested, I know.

486
00:20:26,814 --> 00:20:28,447
Just as you also know

487
00:20:28,449 --> 00:20:30,749
someone with a problem
can't be forced to get help.

488
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:32,551
They have to want it.

489
00:20:32,553 --> 00:20:34,786
What Kitty wants
is to be a detective.

490
00:20:36,523 --> 00:20:38,490
I am taking pains
to try and channel

491
00:20:38,492 --> 00:20:40,592
her residual feelings
into her work.

492
00:20:42,329 --> 00:20:44,463
Well, that works out
great for you.

493
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:48,400
You told me that
you took on a partner

494
00:20:48,402 --> 00:20:50,635
because you wanted to replicate
what you and I had.

495
00:20:50,637 --> 00:20:52,637
That you thought it helped
with your recovery.

496
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:54,539
You think I would
try and take advantage

497
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,208
of the victim of a trauma?

498
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,910
Of course not, but there is
a conflict of interest here.

499
00:20:58,912 --> 00:21:02,447
She needs what she needs,
but you need what you need, too.

500
00:21:06,053 --> 00:21:10,055
It's-it's good that you're
in her life now, Watson.

501
00:21:10,057 --> 00:21:12,524
I mean,
it's commonly believed that, um,

502
00:21:12,526 --> 00:21:16,228
a child benefits mostly from
the presence of two parents.

503
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,164
He-- or she, in this case--
can absorb certain qualities

504
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,466
from the father--
clear-eyed view of the world,

505
00:21:21,468 --> 00:21:23,168
capacity of
rational thought, etcetera.

506
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,170
They can also absorb certain
qualities from the mother.

507
00:21:25,172 --> 00:21:27,105
Excuse me, but I am not
Kitty's mother,

508
00:21:27,107 --> 00:21:28,807
and she sure as hell
is not our child.

509
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:30,942
You brought her here;
she looks up to you.

510
00:21:30,944 --> 00:21:32,944
She says that she doesn't
need help-- fine--

511
00:21:32,946 --> 00:21:34,579
but you know better.

512
00:21:34,581 --> 00:21:37,082
And you're gonna have to be
the one that tells her.

513
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,620
It's Harlan.

514
00:21:41,622 --> 00:21:44,523
Making progress with the maths.

515
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,660
We thought
that Byron and Ike

516
00:21:48,662 --> 00:21:50,462
arrived at Portal Ten
simultaneously.

517
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,664
That would've meant that they
were doing all the same math

518
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,032
at essentially
the same time.

519
00:21:54,034 --> 00:21:56,001
Only, the math
you found at Byron's place

520
00:21:56,003 --> 00:21:57,003
says that's wrong.

521
00:21:57,004 --> 00:21:58,470
He was one step behind Ike.

522
00:21:58,472 --> 00:22:00,705
Are you proposing he did
not kill Mr. Walaczek?

523
00:22:00,707 --> 00:22:03,175
I don't know, but that's
not the weirdest part.

524
00:22:03,177 --> 00:22:04,810
Byron was obsessive.

525
00:22:04,812 --> 00:22:06,211
He time-stamped
almost everything he did.

526
00:22:06,213 --> 00:22:09,047
He only solved
the Portal Nine problem,

527
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:11,316
the same problem that sent me
to that old factory last night.

528
00:22:11,318 --> 00:22:12,884
But get this--

529
00:22:12,886 --> 00:22:14,686
he wasn't given
the same problem as me.

530
00:22:14,688 --> 00:22:16,655
And so it would've yielded
GPS coordinates

531
00:22:16,657 --> 00:22:18,323
for an entirely
different location.

532
00:22:18,325 --> 00:22:21,760
The person in charge of
the game changed the clue

533
00:22:21,762 --> 00:22:23,328
after the police
found Ike's body.

534
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:25,964
Well, he had to, right?

535
00:22:25,966 --> 00:22:27,899
If he hadn't, he would be
sending other competitors

536
00:22:27,901 --> 00:22:29,101
to an active crime scene.

537
00:22:29,103 --> 00:22:30,402
The important thing is

538
00:22:30,404 --> 00:22:31,536
I figured out the coordinates

539
00:22:31,538 --> 00:22:32,771
to the second location.

540
00:22:32,773 --> 00:22:35,540
I know where Byron went.

541
00:22:35,542 --> 00:22:36,842
What are you doing?

542
00:22:36,844 --> 00:22:38,410
You're saying he
time-stamped everything.

543
00:22:38,412 --> 00:22:40,345
I'm looking at the time
he received his clues.

544
00:22:40,347 --> 00:22:42,647
It's all there, to the second,
but what does that have to do...

545
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:44,149
What if you hadn't
found a body?

546
00:22:44,151 --> 00:22:46,118
If the game had
proceeded as planned,

547
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,486
what were you meant
to do there?

548
00:22:47,488 --> 00:22:49,354
I would have sent a text
to the phone number,

549
00:22:49,356 --> 00:22:51,523
the one that the killer painted
over, and then I would have

550
00:22:51,525 --> 00:22:52,891
gotten a message back
with the next problem.

551
00:22:52,893 --> 00:22:54,559
There's an extra
step in there.

552
00:22:54,561 --> 00:22:56,428
Why all this rigmarole with
phone numbers and texts?

553
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,064
Why not just post the problem
itself at the factory?

554
00:22:59,066 --> 00:23:02,100
I don't know, it's just the way
the game is played.

555
00:23:02,102 --> 00:23:04,102
They're for an old
industrial area in Queens.

556
00:23:04,104 --> 00:23:06,805
You're welcome
for finding your suspect.

557
00:23:06,807 --> 00:23:09,207
If I'm right, Harlan,
what you've found...

558
00:23:09,209 --> 00:23:11,109
is the site of
another murder.

559
00:23:11,111 --> 00:23:13,245
Byron Lowenthal's.

560
00:23:15,983 --> 00:23:18,216
You were right,
Lowenthal's dead.

561
00:23:18,218 --> 00:23:20,952
He was shot in the foot,
then the knee.

562
00:23:20,954 --> 00:23:22,821
Just like
Ike Wallaczek.

563
00:23:22,823 --> 00:23:26,391
I'm, uh, gonna look
over here now.

564
00:23:26,393 --> 00:23:29,427
Well, we think the perp
was pulling the body

565
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:31,429
to a car that was parked
over there.

566
00:23:31,431 --> 00:23:34,065
Then he just
left him here.

567
00:23:34,067 --> 00:23:35,901
Probably afraid
he'd been spotted.

568
00:23:35,903 --> 00:23:38,803
There's a lot
of homeless in the area.

569
00:23:41,441 --> 00:23:43,008
Question is:

570
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:45,010
how'd you know
Lowenthal was the next victim

571
00:23:45,012 --> 00:23:46,511
and not the killer?

572
00:23:49,316 --> 00:23:51,750
Well, that's
quite simple, really.

573
00:23:51,752 --> 00:23:54,352
The game is directing
its players to remote locales,

574
00:23:54,354 --> 00:23:56,788
and then instructing them
to send a text message

575
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,256
indicating their presence.

576
00:23:58,258 --> 00:24:00,125
I suspect the killer wanted
to remove the body

577
00:24:00,127 --> 00:24:02,928
so he could keep this new
location “in play,” so to speak.

578
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:05,130
Still missing the “simple” part.

579
00:24:05,132 --> 00:24:06,698
The late Mr. Lowenthal

580
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,366
received his final clue

581
00:24:08,368 --> 00:24:10,235
after Harlan discovered
Ike Wallaczek's body,

582
00:24:10,237 --> 00:24:12,737
but before news of the killing
had reached the media.

583
00:24:12,739 --> 00:24:14,439
That means the
game's designer

584
00:24:14,441 --> 00:24:16,408
knew the location
had been compromised.

585
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,577
And the only way
that he could have known that,

586
00:24:18,579 --> 00:24:20,111
at the time that he knew it,

587
00:24:20,113 --> 00:24:21,880
was if he, himself,
was the killer.

588
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,917
Belphegor's Prime is not
a treasure hunt.

589
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,619
It's a trap.

590
00:24:40,696 --> 00:24:42,196
Better?

591
00:24:42,198 --> 00:24:44,665
False alarm.

592
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:47,668
But I still feel
a little queasy.

593
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,273
This new dead guy--

594
00:24:52,275 --> 00:24:54,875
your friend said that he was
tortured, too, right?

595
00:24:54,877 --> 00:24:57,244
Right before the killer tried
to abscond with his corpse.

596
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:59,213
I assume
he intended to take

597
00:24:59,215 --> 00:25:02,383
Ike Wallaczek away with him
as well, only Ike was too large.

598
00:25:02,385 --> 00:25:04,685
A speedy mothballing
was the best he could do.

599
00:25:04,687 --> 00:25:07,221
So, just to recap,

600
00:25:07,223 --> 00:25:09,657
I've spent the last
few months of my life

601
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:13,360
playing a game that was
designed to kill me.

602
00:25:13,362 --> 00:25:15,629
Got to be a metaphor
in there somewhere, right?

603
00:25:15,631 --> 00:25:18,966
I think the word you're
looking for is “moral.”

604
00:25:18,968 --> 00:25:21,902
There is a moral in there:
games are for idiots.

605
00:25:24,707 --> 00:25:26,473
Breaking news from Ramapo.

606
00:25:26,475 --> 00:25:29,443
Kitty reports the Center for
Applied Mathematics and Logic

607
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,912
is not the sponsor
of Belphegor's Prime.

608
00:25:31,914 --> 00:25:34,148
Then it's got to be
a serial killer, right?

609
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,716
Someone who's obsessed
with mathematicians?

610
00:25:35,718 --> 00:25:37,284
Mm.

611
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,920
Perhaps he was bullied
by mathematicians as a child.

612
00:25:39,922 --> 00:25:42,056
Or mathematicians
killed his parents.

613
00:25:42,058 --> 00:25:43,657
I'm being serious.

614
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:45,726
Serial killers who devise
elaborate death traps

615
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,461
are the stuff of pulp fiction.

616
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:49,229
And besides, with respect
to these murders,

617
00:25:49,231 --> 00:25:51,165
there are none
of the elaborations

618
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:53,767
which mark that sort of culprit.

619
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:55,970
If anything, I would describe
the work as businesslike.

620
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:58,172
Then it's the government.

621
00:25:58,174 --> 00:26:01,241
I mean, the-the game was some
sort of test to weed out people

622
00:26:01,243 --> 00:26:03,243
who could weaponize math.

623
00:26:03,245 --> 00:26:05,179
The American intelligence
apparatus may be clod-like,

624
00:26:05,181 --> 00:26:07,014
but I think they would
do a better job

625
00:26:07,016 --> 00:26:08,749
of disposing of two bodies,
don't you?

626
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:11,785
Watson?

627
00:26:11,787 --> 00:26:13,621
I just heard
from one of the suspects

628
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:14,922
Marcus and I talked to
yesterday,

629
00:26:14,924 --> 00:26:16,290
another puzzle-hunter.

630
00:26:16,292 --> 00:26:18,525
Tell me he confessed
to the murders.

631
00:26:18,527 --> 00:26:20,427
We ruled him out right away,
but he heard about

632
00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:22,329
Byron Lowenthal's murder on
the news and wanted me to know

633
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:25,165
he's at a friend's place,
some guy named Paul.

634
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,934
That is fascinating.

635
00:26:26,936 --> 00:26:28,369
Actually, it might be.

636
00:26:28,371 --> 00:26:31,038
Paul is positive he knows
who the killer is.

637
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,807
I know the guards
are a bit much,

638
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:35,509
but I wanted everyone
to feel safe.

639
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:38,178
And, besides,
math has been good to me.

640
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,279
Commodities.

641
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:40,848
So, you and your friends,

642
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:43,150
you were competitors
in Belphegor's Prime?

643
00:26:43,152 --> 00:26:45,352
Most of us. Some of the others
are just here for the math.

644
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,121
You said you could
identify the killer.

645
00:26:47,123 --> 00:26:49,323
I can, sort of.

646
00:26:52,061 --> 00:26:54,194
“Mo Shellshocker.”

647
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:56,930
It's a pseudonym,
obviously, but I'm telling you,

648
00:26:56,932 --> 00:26:58,365
this is the guy
you're looking for.

649
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,600
I've heard of him.

650
00:26:59,602 --> 00:27:01,335
He uses his blog
to expose bad math.

651
00:27:01,337 --> 00:27:03,837
Corrupt economists, biased
pollsters, that sort of thing.

652
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:05,572
He's actually
sort of a crusader.

653
00:27:05,574 --> 00:27:06,574
He's a murderer.

654
00:27:06,575 --> 00:27:09,143
How can you be
so sure?

655
00:27:09,145 --> 00:27:10,744
When he isn't crusading,
he's competing in puzzle hunts.

656
00:27:10,746 --> 00:27:11,812
A few months ago,

657
00:27:11,814 --> 00:27:13,080
he claimed to
have solved

658
00:27:13,082 --> 00:27:14,815
Cicada 3301 two
years in a row.

659
00:27:14,817 --> 00:27:17,484
Some people called BS,
including...

660
00:27:17,486 --> 00:27:20,120
Ike Wallaczek
and Byron Lowenthal.

661
00:27:20,122 --> 00:27:21,221
“WallaCheckYourMath,”

662
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:22,489
“ByLow2020.”

663
00:27:22,491 --> 00:27:23,757
Those are their
online handles.

664
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:25,392
Their friends
will confirm it.

665
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,528
A flame war does not
a murderer make.

666
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:30,097
The stuff these guys were
slinging at each other was ugly.

667
00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:32,099
Mo knew they were into hunts,
and so he built one

668
00:27:32,101 --> 00:27:34,034
that would send them to places
where he could kill them.

669
00:27:34,036 --> 00:27:35,469
That's what we're
doing here is

670
00:27:35,471 --> 00:27:36,837
we're just sifting
through all the math

671
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:38,338
he's posted on his blog
over the years,

672
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,840
to see if we could
find his signature

673
00:27:39,842 --> 00:27:41,975
or something that
could identify him.

674
00:27:41,977 --> 00:27:45,279
If two people weren't dead,
we'd probably be having fun.

675
00:27:45,281 --> 00:27:46,747
But still, the
chances that he left

676
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:48,582
something like that
in his math...

677
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,784
If it's there, we'll find it.
In the meantime,

678
00:27:50,786 --> 00:27:52,186
we thought the
police should know

679
00:27:52,188 --> 00:27:53,687
who they're really
dealing with.

680
00:27:53,689 --> 00:27:55,389
<i>I've got to go meet someone</i>

681
00:27:55,391 --> 00:27:56,924
about my other case.

682
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:59,927
You're good to pass all this
along to Marcus? Okay.

683
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:03,030
I must say, I'm surprised you
didn't offer to stay and help.

684
00:28:03,032 --> 00:28:05,265
Mr. Ettinger makes
a compelling case with respect

685
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,067
to Mo Shellshocker's
viability as a suspect.

686
00:28:07,069 --> 00:28:09,002
Mo is a genius.

687
00:28:09,004 --> 00:28:10,637
We're talking off the charts.

688
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:12,139
Leibniz meets Euler meets Gauss.

689
00:28:12,141 --> 00:28:14,108
Huh.
He may have an ego,

690
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,110
but he's not gonna kill
anyone over a few comments.

691
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:18,312
So, while “The League of
Concerned Mathematician”"

692
00:28:18,314 --> 00:28:21,014
chases its tail up there, I
am gonna do the smart thing

693
00:28:21,016 --> 00:28:22,416
and get out of town.

694
00:28:22,418 --> 00:28:24,485
You can let me know
when it all blows over.

695
00:28:24,487 --> 00:28:26,386
You're not going
anywhere, Harlan.

696
00:28:26,388 --> 00:28:29,223
Or should I call you
